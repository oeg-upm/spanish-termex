Berkeley 2 HP Labs 3 Computer Science Division U.C. Berkeley ABSTRACT Lack of cooperation (free riding) is one of the key problems that confronts todays P2P systems. What makes this problem particularly difficult is the unique set of challenges that P2P systems pose: large populations, high turnover, asymmetry of interest, collusion, zero-cost identities, and traitors. To tackle these challenges we model the P2P system using the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma (GPD), and propose the Reciprocative decision function as the basis of a family of incentives techniques. These techniques are fully distributed and include: discriminating server selection, maxflowbased subjective reputation, and adaptive stranger policies. Through simulation, we show that these techniques can drive a system of strategic users to nearly optimal levels of cooperation.

INTRODUCTION Many peer-to-peer (P2P) systems rely on cooperation among selfinterested users. For example, in a file-sharing system, overall download latency and failure rate increase when users do not share their resources [3]. In a wireless ad-hoc network, overall packet latency and loss rate increase when nodes refuse to forward packets on behalf of others [26]. Further examples are file preservation [25], discussion boards [17], online auctions [16], and overlay routing [6]. In many of these systems, users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance. As a result, each users attempt to maximize her own utility effectively lowers the overall A BC Figure 1: Example of asymmetry of interest. A wants service from B, B wants service form C, and C wants service from A. utility of the system. Avoiding this tragedy of the commons [18] requires incentives for cooperation. We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem. In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously. While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest. In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash). Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context. Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly. However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity. We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history. Consider the example in Figure 1. If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally. However, if everyone keeps only private history, no one will provide service because B does not know that A has served C, etc. We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A. This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history. The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion. In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service. We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population. The basic idea is that B would only believe C if C had already provided service to B. The cost of the maxflow algorithm is its O(V 3 ) running time, where V is the number of nodes in the system. To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation. We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped. We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system. The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers. The peer could be making a strategic decision or someone may have hijacked her identity (e.g., by compromising her host). Long-term history exacerbates this problem by allowing peers with many previous transactions to exploit that history for many new transactions. We show that short-term history prevents traitors from disrupting cooperation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the model in Section 2 and the reciprocative decision function in Section 3. We then proceed to the incentive techniques in Section 4. In Section 4.1, we describe the challenges of large populations and high turnover and show the effectiveness of discriminating server selection and shared history. In Section 4.2, we describe collusion and demonstrate how subjective reputation mitigates it. In Section 4.3, we present the problem of zero-cost identities and show how an adaptive stranger policy promotes persistent identities. In Section 4.4, we show how traitors disrupt cooperation and how short-term history deals with them. We discuss related work in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 2. MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS In this section, we present our assumptions about P2P systems and their users, and introduce a model that aims to capture the behavior of users in a P2P system. 2.1 Assumptions We assume a P2P system in which users are strategic, i.e., they act rationally to maximize their benefit. However, to capture some of the real-life unpredictability in the behavior of users, we allow users to randomly change their behavior with a low probability (see Section 2.4). For simplicity, we assume a homogeneous system in which all peers issue and satisfy requests at the same rate. A peer can satisfy any request, and, unless otherwise specified, peers request service uniformly at random from the population.1 . Finally, we assume that all transactions incur the same cost to all servers and provide the same benefit to all clients. We assume that users can pollute shared history with false recommendations (Section 4.2), switch identities at zero-cost (Section 4.3), and spoof other users (Section 4.4). We do not assume any centralized trust or centralized infrastructure. 2.2 Model To aid the development and study of the incentive schemes, in this section we present a model of the users behaviors. In particular, we model the benefits and costs of P2P interactions (the game) and population dynamics caused by mutation, learning, and turnover. Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants. Transactions should be able to have asymmetric payoffs. • Untraceable Defections: A peer should not be able to determine the identity of peers who have defected on her. This models the difficulty or expense of determining that a peer could have provided a service, but didnt. For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma. T, R, P, and S stand for temptation, reward, punishment and sucker, respectively. 2.3 Generalized Prisoners Dilemma The Prisoners Dilemma, developed by Flood, Dresher, and Tucker in 1950 [22] is a non-cooperative repeated game satisfying the social dilemma requirement. Each game consists of two players who can defect or cooperate. Depending how each acts, the players receive a payoff. The players use a strategy to decide how to act. Unfortunately, existing work either uses a specific asymmetric payoff matrix or only gives the general form for a symmetric one [4]. Instead, we use the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma (GPD), which specifies the general form for an asymmetric payoff matrix that preserves the social dilemma. In the GPD, one player is the client and one player is the server in each game, and it is only the decision of the server that is meaningful for determining the outome of the transaction. A player can be a client in one game and a server in another. The client and server receive the payoff from a generalized payoff matrix (Figure 2). Rc, Sc, Tc, and Pc are the clients payoff and Rs, Ss, Ts, and Ps are the servers payoff. A GPD payoff matrix must have the following properties to create a social dilemma: 1. Mutual cooperation leads to higher payoffs than mutual defection (Rs + Rc > Ps + Pc). 2. Mutual cooperation leads to higher payoffs than one player suckering the other (Rs + Rc > Sc + Ts and Rs + Rc > Ss + Tc). 3. Defection dominates cooperation (at least weakly) at the individual level for the entity who decides whether to cooperate or defect: (Ts ≥ Rs and Ps ≥ Ss and (Ts > Rs or Ps > Ss)) The last set of inequalities assume that clients do not incur a cost regardless of whether they cooperate or defect, and therefore clients always cooperate. These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma. Furthermore, one or more of the four possible actions (client cooperate and defect, and server cooperate and defect) can be untraceable. If one player makes an untraceable action, the other player does not know the identity of the first player. For example, to model a P2P application like file sharing or overlay routing, we use the specific payoff matrix values shown in Figure 3. This satisfies the inequalities specified above, where only the server can choose between cooperating and defecting. In addition, for this particular payoff matrix, clients are unable to trace server defections. This is the payoff matrix that we use in our simulation results.

Several studies [4] [28] of repeated Prisoners Dilemma games use an evolutionary model [19] [34] of population dynamics. An evolutionary model is not suitable for P2P systems because it only specifies the global behavior and all changes occur at discrete times. For example, it may specify that a population of 5 100% Cooperate players and 5 100% Defect players evolves into a population with 3 and 7 players, respectively. It does not specify which specific players switched. Furthermore, all the switching occurs at the end of a generation instead of continuously, like in a real P2P system. As a result, evolutionary population dynamics do not accurately model turnover, traitors, and strangers. In our model, entities take independent and continuous actions that change the composition of the population. Time consists of rounds. In each round, every player plays one game as a client and one game as a server. At the end of a round, a player may: 1) mutate 2) learn, 3) turnover, or 4) stay the same. If a player mutates, she switches to a randomly picked strategy. If she learns, she switches to a strategy that she believes will produce a higher score (described in more detail below). If she maintains her identity after switching strategies, then she is referred to as a traitor. If a player suffers turnover, she leaves the system and is replaced with a newcomer who uses the same strategy as the exiting player. To learn, a player collects local information about the performance of different strategies. This information consists of both her personal observations of strategy performance and the observations of those players she interacts with. This models users communicating out-of-band about how strategies perform. Let s be the running average of the performance of a players current strategy per round and age be the number of rounds she has been using the strategy. A strategys rating is RunningAverage(s ∗ age) RunningAverage(age) . We use the age and compute the running average before the ratio to prevent young samples (which are more likely to be outliers) from skewing the rating. At the end of a round, a player switches to highest rated strategy with a probability proportional to the difference in score between her current strategy and the highest rated strategy. 104 3. RECIPROCATIVE DECISION FUNCTION In this section, we present the new decision function, Reciprocative, that is the basis for our incentive techniques. A decision function maps from a history of a players actions to a decision whether to cooperate with or defect on that player. A strategy consists of a decision function, private or shared history, a server selection mechanism, and a stranger policy. Our approach to incentives is to design strategies which maximize both individual and social benefit. Strategic users will choose to use such strategies and thereby drive the system to high levels of cooperation. Two examples of simple decision functions are 100% Cooperate and 100% Defect. 100% Cooperate models a naive user who does not yet realize that she is being exploited. 100% Defect models a greedy user who is intent on exploiting the system. In the absence of incentive techniques, 100% Defect users will quickly dominate the 100% Cooperate users and destroy cooperation in the system. Our requirements for a decision function are that (1) it can use shared and subjective history, (2) it can deal with untraceable defections, and (3) it is robust against different patterns of defection. Previous decision functions such as Tit-for-Tat[4] and Image[28] (see Section 5) do not satisfy these criteria. For example, Tit-for-Tat and Image base their decisions on both cooperations and defections, therefore cannot deal with untraceable defections . In this section and the remaining sections we demonstrate how the Reciprocativebased strategies satisfy all of the requirements stated above. The probability that a Reciprocative player cooperates with a peer is a function of its normalized generosity. Generosity measures the benefit an entity has provided relative to the benefit it has consumed. This is important because entities which consume more services than they provide, even if they provide many services, will cause cooperation to collapse. For some entity i, let pi and ci be the services i has provided and consumed, respectively. Entity is generosity is simply the ratio of the service it provides to the service it consumes: g(i) = pi/ci. (1) One possibility is to cooperate with a probability equal to the generosity. Although this is effective in some cases, in other cases, a Reciprocative player may consume more than she provides (e.g., when initially using the Stranger Defect policy in 4.3). This will cause Reciprocative players to defect on each other. To prevent this situation, a Reciprocative player uses its own generosity as a measuring stick to judge its peers generosity. Normalized generosity measures entity is generosity relative to entity js generosity. More concretely, entity is normalized generosity as perceived by entity j is gj(i) = g(i)/g(j). (2) In the remainder of this section, we describe our simulation framework, and use it to demonstrate the benefits of the baseline Reciprocative decision function.

We use the asymmetric file sharing payoff matrix (Figure 3) with untraceable defections because it models transactions in many P2P systems like file-sharing and packet forwarding in ad-hoc and overlay networks. Our simulation study is composed of different scenarios reflecting the challenges of various non-cooperative behaviors. Table 1 presents the nominal parameter values used in our simulation. The Ratio using rows refer to the initial ratio of the total population using a particular strategy. In each scenario we vary the value range of a specific parameter to reflect a particular situation or attack. We then vary the exact properties of the Reciprocative strategy to defend against that situation or attack. 3.2 Baseline Results 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Population Time (a) Total Population: 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Time (b) Total Population: 120 Defector Cooperator Recip.

Figures 4(a) (60 players) and (b) (120 players) show players switching to higher scoring strategies over time in two separate runs of the simulator. Each point in the graph represents the number of players using a particular strategy at one point in time. Figures 5(a) and (b) show the corresponding mean overall score per round. This measures the degree of cooperation in the system: 6 is the maximum possible (achieved when everybody cooperates) and 0 is the minimum (achieved when everybody defects).

We use this metric in all later results to evaluate our incentive techniques. Figure 5(a) shows that the Reciprocative strategy using private history causes a system of 60 players to converge to a cooperation level of 3.7, but drops to 0.5 for 120 players. One would expect the 60 player system to reach the optimal level of cooperation (6) because all the defectors are eliminated from the system. It does not because of asymmetry of interest. For example, suppose player B is using Reciprocative with private history. Player A may happen to ask for service from player B twice in succession without providing service to player B in the interim. Player B does not know of the service player A has provided to others, so player B will reject service to player A, even though player A is cooperative. We discuss solutions to asymmetry of interest and the failure of Reciprocative in the 120 player system in Section 4.1. 4. RECIPROCATIVE-BASED INCENTIVE TECHNIQUES In this section we present our incentives techniques and evaluate their behavior by simulation. To make the exposition clear we group our techniques by the challenges they address: large populations and high turnover (Section 4.1), collusions (Section 4.2), zero-cost identities (Section 4.3), and traitors (Section 4.4). 4.1 Large Populations and High Turnover The large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity. Under these conditions, basing decisions only on private history (records about interactions the peer has been directly involved in) is not effective. In addition, private history does not deal well with asymmetry of interest. For example, if player B has cooperated with others but not with player A himself in the past, player A has no indication of player Bs generosity, thus may unduly defect on him. We propose two mechanisms to alleviate the problem of few repeat transactions: server-selection and shared history. 4.1.1 Server Selection A natural way to increase the probability of interacting with familiar peers is by discriminating server selection. However, the asymmetry of transactions challenges selection mechanisms. Unlike in the prisoners dilemma payoff matrix, where players can benefit one another within a single transaction, transactions in GPD are asymmetric. As a result, a player who selects her donor for the second time without contributing to her in the interim may face a defection. In addition, due to untraceability of defections, it is impossible to maintain blacklists to avoid interactions with known defectors. In order to deal with asymmetric transactions, every player holds (fixed size) lists of both past donors and past recipients, and selects a server from one of these lists at random with equal probabilities. This way, users approach their past recipients and give them a chance to reciprocate. In scenarios with selective users we omit the complete availability assumption to prevent players from being clustered into a lot of very small groups; thus, we assume that every player can perform the requested service with probability p (for the results presented in this section, p = .3). In addition, in order to avoid bias in favor of the selective players, all players (including the non-discriminative ones) select servers for games. Figure 6 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed selection mechanism in scenarios with large population sizes. We fix the initial ratio of Reciprocative in the population (33%) while varying the population size (between 24 to 1000) (Notice that while in Figures 4(a) and (b), the data points demonstrates the evolution of the system over time, each data point in this figure is the result of an entire simulation for a specific scenario). The figure shows that the Reciprocative decision function using private history in conjunction with selective behavior can scale to large populations. In Figure 7 we fix the population size and vary the turnover rate. It demonstrates that while selective behavior is effective for low turnover rates, as turnover gets higher, selective behavior does not scale. This occurs because selection is only effective as long as players from the past stay alive for long enough such that they can be selected for future games. 4.1.2 Shared history In order to mitigate asymmetry of interest and scale to higher turnover rate, there is a need in shared history. Shared history means that every peer keeps records about all of the interactions that occur in the system, regardless of whether he was directly involved in them or not. It allows players to leverage off of the experiences of others in cases of few repeat transactions. It only requires that someone has interacted with a particular player for the entire population to observe it, thus scales better to large populations and high turnovers, and also tolerates asymmetry of interest. Some examples of shared history schemes are [20] [23] [28]. Figure 7 shows the effectiveness of shared history under high turnover rates. In this figure, we fix the population size and vary the turnover rate. While selective players with private history can only tolerate a moderate turnover, shared history scales to turnovers of up to approximately 0.1. This means that 10% of the players leave the system at the end of each round. In Figure 6 we fix the turnover and vary the population size. It shows that shared history causes the system to converge to optimal cooperation and performance, regardless of the size of the population. These results show that shared history addresses all three challenges of large populations, high turnover, and asymmetry of transactions. Nevertheless, shared history has two disadvantages.

The x-axis is the turnover rate. The y-axis is the mean overall per round score. while a decentralized implementation of private history is straightforward, implementation of shared-history requires communication overhead or centralization. A decentralized shared history can be implemented, for example, on top of a DHT, using a peer-to-peer storage system [36] or by disseminating information to other entities in a similar way to routing protocols. Second, and more fundamental, shared history is vulnerable to collusion. In the next section we propose a mechanism that addresses this problem. 4.2 Collusion and Other Shared History Attacks 4.2.1 Collusion While shared history is scalable, it is vulnerable to collusion. Collusion can be either positive (e.g. defecting entities claim that other defecting entities cooperated with them) or negative (e.g. entities claim that other cooperative entities defected on them). Collusion subverts any strategy in which everyone in the system agrees on the reputation of a player (objective reputation). An example of objective reputation is to use the Reciprocative decision function with shared history to count the total number of cooperations a player has given to and received from all entities in the system; another example is the Image strategy [28]. The effect of collusion is magnified in systems with zero-cost identities, where users can create fake identities that report false statements. Instead, to deal with collusion, entities can compute reputation subjectively, where player A weighs player Bs opinions based on how much player A trusts player B. Our subjective algorithm is based on maxflow [24] [32]. Maxflow is a graph theoretic problem, which given a directed graph with weighted edges asks what is the greatest rate at which material can be shipped from the source to the target without violating any capacity constraints. For example, in figure 8 each edge is labeled with the amount of traffic that can travel on it. The maxflow algorithm computes the maximum amount of traffic that can go from the source (s) to the target (t) without violating the constraints. In this example, even though there is a loop of high capacity edges, the maxflow between the source and the target is only 2 (the numbers in brackets represent the actual flow on each edge in the solution). 100(0) 1(1) 5(1) s t 10(1) 100(1) 1(1) 100(1) 20(0) Figure 8: Each edge in the graph is labeled with its capacity and the actual flow it carries in brackets.

We apply the maxflow algorithm by constructing a graph whose vertices are entities and the edges are the services that entities have received from each other. This information can be stored using the same methods as the shared history. A maxflow is the greatest level of reputation the source can give to the sink without violating reputation capacity constraints. As a result, nodes who dishonestly report high reputation values will not be able to subvert the reputation system. Figure 9 illustrates a scenario in which all the colluders (labeled with C) report high reputation values for each other. When node A computes the subjective reputation of B using the maxflow algorithm, it will not be affected by the local false reputation values, rather the maxflow in this case will be 0. This is because no service has been received from any of the colluders. 107 In our algorithm, the benefit that entity i has received (indirectly) from entity j is the maxflow from j to i. Conversely, the benefit that entity i has provided indirectly to j is the maxflow from i to j. The subjective reputation of entity j as perceived by i is: min maxflow(j to i) maxflow(i to j) , 1 (3) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 MeanOverallScore/Round Population Shared Private Subjective Figure 10: Subjective shared history compared to objective shared history and private history in the presence of colluders.

The standard preflowpush maxflow algorithm has a worst case running time of O(V 3 ). Instead, we use Algorithm 1 which has a constant mean running time, but sometimes returns no flow even though one exists. The essential idea is to bound the mean number of nodes examined during the maxflow computation. This bounds the overhead, but also bounds the effectiveness. Despite this, the results below show that a maxflow-based Reciprocative decision function scales to higher populations than one using private history. Figure 10 compares the effectiveness of subjective reputation to objective reputation in the presence of colluders. In these scenarios, defectors collude by claiming that other colluders that they encounter gave them 100 cooperations for that encounter. Also, the parameters for Algorithm 1 are set as follows: increment = 100, α = 0.9. As in previous sections, Reciprocative with private history results in cooperation up to a point, beyond which it fails. The difference here is that objective shared history fails for all population sizes. This is because the Reciprocative players cooperate with the colluders because of their high reputations. However, subjective history can reach high levels of cooperation regardless of colluders. This is because there are no high weight paths in the cooperation graph from colluders to any non-colluders, so the maxflow from a colluder to any non-colluder is 0. Therefore, a subjective Reciprocative player will conclude that that colluder has not provided any service to her and will reject service to the colluder. Thus, the maxflow algorithm enables Reciprocative to maintain the scalability of shared history without being vulnerable to collusion or requiring centralized trust (e.g., trusted peers). Since we bound the running time of the maxflow algorithm, cooperation decreases as the population size increases, but the key point is that the subjective Reciprocative decision function scales to higher populations than one using private history. This advantage only increases over time as CPU power increases and more cycles can be devoted to running the maxflow algorithm (by increasing the increment parameter). Despite the robustness of the maxflow algorithm to the simple form of collusion described previously, it still has vulnerabilities to more sophisticated attacks. One is for an entity (the mole) to provide service and then lie positively about other colluders. The other colluders can then exploit their reputation to receive service. However, the effectiveness of this attack relies on the amount of service that the mole provides. Since the mole is paying all of the cost of providing service and receiving none of the benefit, she has a strong incentive to stop colluding and try another strategy. This forces the colluders to use mechanisms to maintain cooperation within their group, which may drive the cost of collusion to exceed the benefit. 4.2.2 False reports Another attack is for a defector to lie about receiving or providing service to another entity. There are four possibile actions that can be lied about: providing service, not providing service, receiving service, and not receiving service. Falsely claiming to receive service is the simple collusion attack described above. Falsely claiming not to have provided service provides no benefit to the attacker. Falsely claiming to have provided service or not to have received it allows an attacker to boost her own reputation and/or lower the reputation of another entity. An entity may want to lower another entitys reputation in order to discourage others from selecting it and exclusively use its service. These false claims are clearly identifiable in the shared history as inconsistencies where one entity claims a transaction occurred and another claims it did not. To limit this attack, we modify the maxflow algorithm so that an entity always believes the entity that is closer to him in the flow graph. If both entities are equally distant, then the disputed edge in the flow is not critical to the evaluation and is ignored. This modification prevents those cases where the attacker is making false claims about an entity that is closer than her to the evaluating entity, which prevents her from boosting her own reputation. The remaining possibilities are for the attacker to falsely claim to have provided service to or not to have received it from a victim entity that is farther from the evalulator than her. In these cases, an attacker can only lower the reputation of the victim. The effectiveness of doing this is limited by the number of services provided and received by the attacker, which makes executing this attack expensive. 108 4.3 Zero-Cost Identities History assumes that entities maintain persistent identities. However, in most P2P systems, identities are zero-cost. This is desirable for network growth as it encourages newcomers to join the system. However, this also allows misbehaving users to escape the consequences of their actions by switching to new identities (i.e., whitewashing). Whitewashers can cause the system to collapse if they are not punished appropriately. Unfortunately, a player cannot tell if a stranger is a whitewasher or a legitimate newcomer. Always cooperating with strangers encourages newcomers to join, but at the same time encourages whitewashing behavior. Always defecting on strangers prevents whitewashing, but discourages newcomers from joining and may also initiate unfavorable cycles of defection. This tension suggests that any stranger policy that has a fixed probability of cooperating with strangers will fail by either being too stingy when most strangers are newcomers or too generous when most strangers are whitewashers. Our solution is the Stranger Adaptive stranger policy. The idea is to be generous to strangers when they are being generous and stingy when they are stingy. Let ps and cs be the number of services that strangers have provided and consumed, respectively. The probability that a player using Stranger Adaptive helps a stranger is ps/cs. However, we do not wish to keep these counts permanently (for reasons described in Section 4.4). Also, players may not know when strangers defect because defections are untraceable (as described in Section 2). Consequently, instead of keeping ps and cs, we assume that k = ps + cs, where k is a constant and we keep the running ratio r = ps/cs. When we need to increment ps or cs, we generate the current values of ps and cs from k and r: cs = k/(1 + r) ps = cs ∗ r We then compute the new r as follows: r = (ps + 1)/cs , if the stranger provided service r = ps/(cs + 1) , if the stranger consumed service This method allows us to keep a running ratio that reflects the recent generosity of strangers without knowing when strangers have defected. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 MeanOverallScore/Round Turnover Stranger Cooperate Stranger Defect Stranger Adaptive Figure 11: Different stranger policies for Reciprocative with shared history.

In both figures, the players using the 100% Defect strategy change their identity (whitewash) after every transaction and are indistinguishable from legitimate newcomers. The Reciprocative players using the Stranger Cooperate policy completely fail to achieve cooperation. This stranger policy allows whitewashers to maximize their payoff and consequently provides a high incentive for users to switch to whitewashing. In contrast, Figure 11 shows that the Stranger Defect policy is effective with shared history. This is because whitewashers always appear to be strangers and therefore the Reciprocative players will always defect on them. This is consistent with previous work [13] showing that punishing strangers deals with whitewashers. However, Figure 12 shows that Stranger Defect is not effective with private history. This is because Reciprocative requires some initial cooperation to bootstrap. In the shared history case, a Reciprocative player can observe that another player has already cooperated with others. With private history, the Reciprocative player only knows about the other players actions toward her. Therefore, the initial defection dictated by the Stranger Defect policy will lead to later defections, which will prevent Reciprocative players from ever cooperating with each other. In other simulations not shown here, the Stranger Defect stranger policy fails even with shared history when there are no initial 100% Cooperate players. Figure 11 shows that with shared history, the Stranger Adaptive policy performs as well as Stranger Defect policy until the turnover rate is very high (10% of the population turning over after every transaction). In these scenarios, Stranger Adaptive is using k = 10 and each player keeps a private r. More importantly, it is significantly better than Stranger Defect policy with private history because it can bootstrap cooperation. Although the Stranger Defect policy is marginally more effective than Stranger Adaptive at very high rates of turnover, P2P systems are unlikely to operate there because other services (e.g., routing) also cannot tolerate very high turnover. We conclude that of the stranger policies that we have explored, Stranger Adaptive is the most effective. By using Stranger Adaptive, P2P systems with zero-cost identities and a sufficiently low turnover can sustain cooperation without a centralized allocation of identities. 109 4.4 Traitors Traitors are players who acquire high reputation scores by cooperating for a while, and then traitorously turn into defectors before leaving the system. They model both users who turn deliberately to gain a higher score and cooperators whose identities have been stolen and exploited by defectors. A strategy that maintains longterm history without discriminating between old and recent actions becomes highly vulnerable to exploitation by these traitors. The top two graphs in Figure 13 demonstrate the effect of traitors on cooperation in a system where players keep long-term history (never clear history). In these simulations, we run for 2000 rounds and allow cooperative players to keep their identities when switching to the 100% Defector strategy. We use the default values for the other parameters. Without traitors, the cooperative strategies thrive. With traitors, the cooperative strategies thrive until a cooperator turns traitor after 600 rounds. As this cooperator exploits her reputation to achieve a high score, other cooperative players notice this and follow suit via learning. Cooperation eventually collapses. On the other hand, if we maintain short-term history and/or discounting ancient history vis-a-vis recent history, traitors can be quickly detected, and the overall cooperation level stays high, as shown in the bottom two graphs in Figure 13. 0 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Long-TermHistory No Traitors Population 0 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Traitors Defector Cooperator Recip.

RELATED WORK Previous work has examined the incentive problem as applied to societies in general and more recently to Internet applications and peer-to-peer systems in particular. A well-known phenomenon in this context is the tragedy of the commons [18] where resources are under-provisioned due to selfish users who free-ride on the systems resources, and is especially common in large networks [29] [3]. The problem has been extensively studied adopting a game theoretic approach. The prisoners dilemma model provides a natural framework to study the effectiveness of different strategies in establishing cooperation among players. In a simulation environment with many repeated games, persistent identities, and no collusion, Axelrod [4] shows that the Tit-for-Tat strategy dominates. Our model assumes growth follows local learning rather than evolutionary dynamics [14], and also allows for more kinds of attacks. Nowak and Sigmund [28] introduce the Image strategy and demonstrate its ability to establish cooperation among players despite few repeat transactions by the employment of shared history. Players using Image cooperate with players whose global count of cooperations minus defections exceeds some threshold. As a result, an Image player is either vulnerable to partial defectors (if the threshold is set too low) or does not cooperate with other Image players (if the threshold is set too high). In recent years, researchers have used economic mechanism design theory to tackle the cooperation problem in Internet applications. Mechanism design is the inverse of game theory. It asks how to design a game in which the behavior of strategic players results in the socially desired outcome. Distributed Algorithmic Mechanism Design seeks solutions within this framework that are both fully distributed and computationally tractable [12]. [10] and [11] are examples of applying DAMD to BGP routing and multicast cost sharing. More recently, DAMD has been also studied in dynamic environments [38]. In this context, demonstrating the superiority of a cooperative strategy (as in the case of our work) is consistent with the objective of incentivizing the desired behavior among selfish players. The unique challenges imposed by peer-to-peer systems inspired additional body of work [5] [37], mainly in the context of packet forwarding in wireless ad-hoc routing [8] [27] [30] [35], and file sharing [15] [31]. Friedman and Resnick [13] consider the problem of zero-cost identities in online environments and find that in such systems punishing all newcomers is inevitable. Using a theoretical model, they demonstrate that such a system can converge to cooperation only for sufficiently low turnover rates, which our results confirm. [6] and [9] show that whitewashing and collusion can have dire consequences for peer-to-peer systems and are difficult to prevent in a fully decentralized system. Some commercial file sharing clients [1] [2] provide incentive mechanisms which are enforced by making it difficult for the user to modify the source code. These mechanisms can be circumvented by a skilled user or by a competing company releasing a compatible client without the incentive restrictions. Also, these mechanisms are still vulnerable to zero-cost identities and collusion. BitTorrent [7] uses Tit-for-Tat as a method for resource allocation, where a users upload rate dictates his download rate. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we take a game theoretic approach to the problem of cooperation in peer-to-peer networks. Addressing the challenges imposed by P2P systems, including large populations, high turnover, asymmetry of interest and zero-cost identities, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon the Reciprocative decision function, to support cooperative behavior and improve overall system performance. We find that the adoption of shared history and discriminating server selection techniques can mitigate the challenge of few repeat transactions that arises due to large population size, high turnover and asymmetry of interest. Furthermore, cooperation can be established even in the presence of zero-cost identities through the use of an adaptive policy towards strangers. Finally, colluders and traitors can be kept in check via subjective reputations and short-term history, respectively. 110 7. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Mary Baker, T.J.

Berkeley 2 HP Labs 3 División de Ciencias de la Computación U.C. La falta de cooperación (conducción gratuita) de Berkeley es uno de los problemas clave que confronta los sistemas P2P de hoy. Lo que hace que este problema sea particularmente difícil es el conjunto único de desafíos que plantean los sistemas P2P: grandes poblaciones, alta rotación, asimetría de interés, colusión, identidades de costo cero y traidores. Para abordar estos desafíos, modelamos el sistema P2P utilizando el dilema generalizado de los prisioneros (GPD) y proponemos la función de decisión recíproca como la base de una familia de técnicas de incentivos. Estas técnicas están completamente distribuidas e incluyen: discriminar la selección del servidor, la reputación subjetiva basada en Maxflow y las políticas de extraños adaptativos. A través de la simulación, mostramos que estas técnicas pueden llevar un sistema de usuarios estratégicos a niveles de cooperación casi óptimos.

Introducción Muchos sistemas de igual a igual (P2P) dependen de la cooperación entre los usuarios autointerestados. Por ejemplo, en un sistema de intercambio de archivos, la latencia de descarga general de la latencia y la tasa de falla aumentan cuando los usuarios no comparten sus recursos [3]. En una red inalámbrica ad-hoc, la latencia general de la latencia y la tasa de pérdida de los paquetes aumentan cuando los nodos se niegan a reenviar paquetes en nombre de otros [26]. Otros ejemplos son la preservación de archivos [25], los paneles de discusión [17], las subastas en línea [16] y el enrutamiento de superposición [6]. En muchos de estos sistemas, los usuarios tienen desincentivos naturales para cooperar porque la cooperación consume sus propios recursos y puede degradar su propio rendimiento. Como resultado, cada usuarios intenta maximizar su propia utilidad reduce efectivamente el BC Figura 1 general: Ejemplo de asimetría de interés. A quiere servicio de B, B quiere el formulario de servicio C y C quiere el servicio de A. Utility of the System. Evitar esta tragedia de los bienes comunes [18] requiere incentivos para la cooperación. Adoptamos un enfoque teórico del juego para abordar este problema. En particular, utilizamos un modelo de dilema de prisioneros para capturar la tensión esencial entre la utilidad individual y social, las matrices de pago asimétricas para permitir transacciones asimétricas entre pares y un modelo dinámico de población basado en el aprendizaje [14] para especificar el comportamiento de los compañeros individuales que, quese puede cambiar continuamente. Si bien los dilemas sociales se han estudiado ampliamente, las aplicaciones P2P imponen un conjunto único de desafíos, que incluyen: • Grandes poblaciones y alta rotación: un sistema de intercambio de archivos como Gnutella y Kazaa puede superar los 100, 000 usuarios simultáneos, y los nodos pueden tener un promedio de vida de vida.-Tiempo del orden de las actas [33].• Asimetría de interés: las transacciones asimétricas de los sistemas P2P crean la posibilidad de asimetría de interés. En el ejemplo de la Figura 1, A quiere servicio de B, B quiere servicio de C y C quiere servicio de A. • Identidad de costo cero: muchos sistemas P2P permiten a los compañeros cambiar continuamente las identidades (es decir, Whitlwave). Las estrategias que funcionan bien en los juegos de dilema de prisioneros tradicionales como Tit-for-Tat [4] no funcionarán bien en el contexto P2P. Por lo tanto, proponemos una familia de técnicas de incentivos escalables y robustas, basadas en una nueva función de decisión recíproca, para abordar estos desafíos y proporcionar diferentes compensaciones: • Discriminando la selección del servidor: la cooperación requiere familiaridad entre las entidades, ya sea directa o indirectamente. Sin embargo, las grandes poblaciones y la alta rotación de los sistemas P2P hacen que sea menos probable que ocurran interacciones repetidas con una entidad familiar. Mostramos que al hacer que cada compañero mantenga un historial privado de las acciones de otros pares hacia ella, y utilizando la selección discriminatoria del servidor, la función de decisión recíproca puede escalar a grandes poblaciones y niveles moderados de facturación.• Historia compartida: la escala a una mayor facturación y la mitigación de la asimetría de interés requiere un historial compartido. Considere el ejemplo en la Figura 1. Si todos brindan servicio, entonces el sistema funciona de manera óptima. Sin embargo, si todos mantienen solo la historia privada, nadie brindará servicio porque B no sabe que A ha servido C, etc. Mostramos que con la historia compartida, B sabe que A Servido C y, en consecuencia, servirá a A. Esto da como resultado un mayor nivel de cooperación que con la historia privada. El costo de la historia compartida es una infraestructura distribuida (por ejemplo, almacenamiento distribuido basado en la mesa) para almacenar el historial.• Reputación subjetiva basada en Maxflow: la historia compartida crea la posibilidad de colusión. En el ejemplo de la Figura 1, C puede afirmar falsamente que A le sirvió, engañando así a B para que brinde servicio. Mostramos que un algoritmo basado en el máximo flujo que calcula la reputación promueve subjetivamente la cooperación a pesar de la colusión entre 1/3 de la población. La idea básica es que B solo creería C si C ya hubiera brindado servicio a B. El costo del algoritmo MaxFlow es su tiempo de ejecución O (V 3), donde V es el número de nodos en el sistema. Para eliminar este costo, hemos desarrollado una variación de tiempo de ejecución media constante, que intercambia efectividad para la complejidad de la computación. Mostramos que el algoritmo basado en Maxflow escala mejor que la historia privada en presencia de coluders sin la confianza centralizada requerida en trabajos anteriores [9] [20].• Política adaptativa de extraños: las identidades de costo cero permiten a los compañeros no cooperantes escapar de las consecuencias de no cooperar y eventualmente destruir la cooperación en el sistema si no se detienen. Mostramos que si los compañeros recíprotrativos tratan a los extraños (pares sin historia) que usan una política que se adapta al comportamiento de extraños anteriores, los compañeros tienen pocos incentivos para blanquear y blanquear el sistema casi se pueden eliminar del sistema. La política de extraños adaptativos hace esto sin requerir la asignación centralizada de identidades, una tarifa de entrada para los recién llegados o la limitación de tarifas [13] [9] [25].• Historia a corto plazo: la historia también crea la posibilidad de que un compañero de comportamiento previamente bien bien bien con una buena reputación se convierta en traidor y use su buena reputación para explotar a otros pares. El compañero podría estar tomando una decisión estratégica o alguien puede haber secuestrado su identidad (por ejemplo, comprometiendo a su anfitrión). El historial a largo plazo exacerba este problema al permitir que los compañeros con muchas transacciones anteriores exploten esa historia para muchas transacciones nuevas. Mostramos que la historia a corto plazo evita que los traidores alteren la cooperación. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. Describimos el modelo en la Sección 2 y la función de decisión reciprocativa en la Sección 3. Luego procedemos a las técnicas de incentivos en la Sección 4. En la Sección 4.1, describimos los desafíos de las grandes poblaciones y la alta rotación y mostramos la efectividad de discriminar la selección del servidor y el historial compartido. En la Sección 4.2, describimos la colusión y demostramos cómo la reputación subjetiva la mitiga. En la Sección 4.3, presentamos el problema de las identidades de costo cero y mostramos cómo una política adaptativa de extraños promueve las identidades persistentes. En la Sección 4.4, mostramos cómo los traidores interrumpen la cooperación y cómo la historia a corto plazo trata con ellos. Discutimos el trabajo relacionado en la Sección 5 y concluimos en la Sección 6. 2. Modelo y suposiciones En esta sección, presentamos nuestros supuestos sobre los sistemas P2P y sus usuarios, e presentamos un modelo que tiene como objetivo capturar el comportamiento de los usuarios en un sistema P2P.2.1 Suposiciones Asumimos un sistema P2P en el que los usuarios son estratégicos, es decir, actúan racionalmente para maximizar su beneficio. Sin embargo, para capturar parte de la imprevisibilidad de la vida real en el comportamiento de los usuarios, permitimos a los usuarios cambiar aleatoriamente su comportamiento con una probabilidad baja (ver Sección 2.4). Para simplificar, asumimos un sistema homogéneo en el que todos los pares emiten y satisfacen solicitudes a la misma tasa. Un par puede satisfacer cualquier solicitud y, a menos que se especifique lo contrario, los pares solicitan un servicio de manera uniforme al azar de la población. Finalmente, suponemos que todas las transacciones incurren en el mismo costo para todos los servidores y proporcionan el mismo beneficio a todos los clientes. Suponemos que los usuarios pueden contaminar el historial compartido con falsas recomendaciones (Sección 4.2), cambiar las identidades en costo cero (Sección 4.3) y falsificar a otros usuarios (Sección 4.4). No asumimos ninguna confianza centralizada o infraestructura centralizada.2.2 Modelo para ayudar al desarrollo y al estudio de los esquemas de incentivos, en esta sección presentamos un modelo de comportamientos de los usuarios. En particular, modelamos los beneficios y los costos de las interacciones P2P (el juego) y la dinámica de la población causada por la mutación, el aprendizaje y la rotación. Nuestro modelo está diseñado para tener las siguientes propiedades que caracterizan un gran conjunto de sistemas P2P: • Dilema social: la cooperación universal debería dar lugar a una utilidad general óptima, pero las personas que explotan la cooperación de los demás mientras no cooperan (es decir, defectos) deberían beneficiarmás que los usuarios que cooperan.• Transacciones asimétricas: un par puede querer el servicio de otro par, sin embargo, actualmente no puede proporcionar el servicio que el segundo compañero desea. Las transacciones deben poder tener pagos asimétricos.• Descubos no rastreables: un par no debe poder determinar la identidad de los compañeros que la han desertado. Esto modela la dificultad o el gasto de determinar que un compañero podría haber brindado un servicio, pero no lo hizo. Por ejemplo, en el sistema de intercambio de archivos Gnutella [21], un par puede simplemente ignorar las consultas a pesar de poseer el archivo deseado, evitando así que el par de consultas identifique el compañero de defectos.• Población dinámica: los compañeros deben poder cambiar su comportamiento e ingresar o abandonar el sistema de forma independiente y continua.1 La excepción se discute en la Sección 4.1.1 103 Defecto cooperado Cooperado Defectclient Server SC RR / SC ST / SC PP / SC TS / Figura 2: Matriz de pago para el dilema generalizado de los prisioneros. T, R, P y S representan la tentación, recompensa, castigo y sucker, respectivamente.2.3 Dilema generalizado de los prisioneros El dilema de los prisioneros, desarrollado por Flood, Dresher y Tucker en 1950 [22] es un juego repetido no cooperativo que satisface el requisito del dilema social. Cada juego consta de dos jugadores que pueden desertar o cooperar. Dependiendo de cómo cada uno actúe, los jugadores reciben una recompensa. Los jugadores usan una estrategia para decidir cómo actuar. Desafortunadamente, el trabajo existente usa una matriz de pago asimétrica específica o solo da la forma general para una simétrica [4]. En cambio, utilizamos el dilema generalizado de los prisioneros (GPD), que especifica la forma general para una matriz de pago asimétrica que preserva el dilema social. En el GPD, un reproductor es el cliente y un jugador es el servidor en cada juego, y es solo la decisión del servidor la que es significativa para determinar la salida de la transacción. Un jugador puede ser un cliente en un juego y un servidor en otro. El cliente y el servidor reciben el pago de una matriz de pago generalizada (Figura 2). RC, SC, TC y PC son los clientes que recompensan y RS, SS, TS y PS son los pagos de los servidores. Una matriz de pago GPD debe tener las siguientes propiedades para crear un dilema social: 1. La cooperación mutua conduce a pagos más altos que la deserción mutua (RS + RC> PS + PC).2. La cooperación mutua conduce a pagos más altos que un jugador que absorbe al otro (RS + RC> SC + TS y RS + RC> SS + TC).3. La deserción domina la cooperación (al menos débil) a nivel individual para la entidad que decide si cooperar o defectos: (TS ≥ RS y PS ≥ SS y (TS> RS o PS> SS)) el último conjunto de desigualdades supone que los clientesNo incurra en un costo independientemente de si cooperan o defectan y, por lo tanto, los clientes siempre cooperan. Estas propiedades corresponden a propiedades similares del dilema clásico de los prisioneros y permiten cualquier forma de transacción asimétrica mientras crea un dilema social. Además, una o más de las cuatro acciones posibles (el cliente coopere y defectos, y el servidor coopere y defectos) puede ser inducible. Si un jugador hace una acción imposible de rastrear, el otro jugador no conoce la identidad del primer jugador. Por ejemplo, para modelar una aplicación P2P como compartir archivos o enrutamiento de superposición, utilizamos los valores de matriz de pago específicos que se muestran en la Figura 3. Esto satisface las desigualdades especificadas anteriormente, donde solo el servidor puede elegir entre cooperar y desertar. Además, para esta matriz de pago en particular, los clientes no pueden rastrear las deserciones del servidor. Esta es la matriz de pago que usamos en nuestros resultados de simulación.

Varios estudios [4] [28] de los repetidos juegos de dilema de los prisioneros usan un modelo evolutivo [19] [34] de la dinámica de la población. Un modelo evolutivo no es adecuado para los sistemas P2P porque solo especifica el comportamiento global y todos los cambios ocurren en momentos discretos. Por ejemplo, puede especificar que una población del 5 100% coopere jugadores y 5 100% de defectos de los jugadores evoluciona a una población con 3 y 7 jugadores, respectivamente. No especifica qué jugadores específicos cambiaron. Además, toda la conmutación ocurre al final de una generación en lugar de continuamente, como en un sistema P2P real. Como resultado, la dinámica de la población evolutiva no modela con precisión la rotación, los traidores y los extraños. En nuestro modelo, las entidades toman acciones independientes y continuas que cambian la composición de la población. En cada ronda, cada jugador juega un juego como cliente y un juego como servidor. Al final de una ronda, un jugador puede: 1) Mutado 2) Aprender, 3) Volumen de negocios, o 4) Mantente igual. Si un jugador muta, cambia a una estrategia elegida al azar. Si aprende, cambia a una estrategia que cree que producirá una puntuación más alta (descrita con más detalle a continuación). Si mantiene su identidad después de cambiar de estrategias, entonces se le conoce como traidor. Si un jugador sufre la facturación, deja el sistema y es reemplazada por un recién llegado que usa la misma estrategia que el jugador que exitaba. Para aprender, un jugador recopila información local sobre el rendimiento de diferentes estrategias. Esta información consiste en sus observaciones personales del rendimiento de la estrategia y las observaciones de los jugadores con los que interactúa. Esto modela a los usuarios que comunican fuera de banda sobre cómo funcionan las estrategias. Sea S el promedio de ejecución del rendimiento de la estrategia actual de los jugadores por ronda y la edad, la cantidad de rondas que ha estado utilizando la estrategia. Una calificación de Strategys es RunningAverage (S ∗ Age) RunningAverage (edad). Usamos la edad y calculamos el promedio de carrera antes de la relación para evitar que las muestras jóvenes (que tienen más probabilidades de ser atípicas) sesgar la calificación. Al final de una ronda, un jugador cambia a una estrategia mejor calificada con una probabilidad proporcional a la diferencia de puntaje entre su estrategia actual y la estrategia mejor calificada.104 3. Función de decisión reciprocativa En esta sección, presentamos la nueva función de decisión, recíprocatoria, que es la base de nuestras técnicas de incentivos. Una función de decisión se mapea de una historia de un jugador acciones a una decisión de cooperar o defectar a ese jugador. Una estrategia consiste en una función de decisión, un historial privado o compartido, un mecanismo de selección del servidor y una política de extraños. Nuestro enfoque de los incentivos es diseñar estrategias que maximicen el beneficio individual y social. Los usuarios estratégicos elegirán usar tales estrategias y, por lo tanto, conducir el sistema a altos niveles de cooperación. Dos ejemplos de funciones de decisión simples son el 100% cooperado y el 100% de defecto.100% cooperado modela a un usuario ingenuo que aún no se da cuenta de que está siendo explotada.100% Defect Models Un usuario codicioso que tiene la intención de explotar el sistema. En ausencia de técnicas de incentivos, los usuarios de defectos del 100% dominarán rápidamente el 100% cooperará a los usuarios y destruirán la cooperación en el sistema. Nuestros requisitos para una función de decisión son que (1) puede usar el historial compartido y subjetivo, (2) puede lidiar con desacecciones no rastreables y (3) es robusto contra diferentes patrones de deserción. Las funciones de decisión anteriores como Tit-for-Tat [4] e Image [28] (ver Sección 5) no satisfacen estos criterios. Por ejemplo, TIT-for-Tat e Image basan sus decisiones tanto en cooperaciones como en deserciones, por lo tanto, no pueden lidiar con deserciones imposibles de rastrear. En esta sección y las secciones restantes demostramos cómo las estrategias basadas en el recíproco satisfacen todos los requisitos indicados anteriormente. La probabilidad de que un jugador recíproco coopere con un par es una función de su generosidad normalizada. Medidas de generosidad El beneficio que una entidad ha proporcionado en relación con el beneficio que ha consumido. Esto es importante porque las entidades que consumen más servicios de los que brindan, incluso si proporcionan muchos servicios, harán que la cooperación colapse. Para alguna entidad I, deje que Pi y CI sean los servicios que he brindado y consumido, respectivamente. La entidad es la generosidad es simplemente la relación del servicio que brinda al servicio que consume: g (i) = pi/ci.(1) Una posibilidad es cooperar con una probabilidad igual a la generosidad. Aunque esto es efectivo en algunos casos, en otros casos, un jugador recíproco puede consumir más de lo que proporciona (por ejemplo, cuando inicialmente usa la política de defectos de extraños en 4.3). Esto hará que los jugadores recíprocos se deserten unos a otros. Para evitar esta situación, un jugador recíproco utiliza su propia generosidad como un palo de medición para juzgar la generosidad de sus compañeros. La entidad de medidas de generosidad normalizadas es generosidad en relación con la generosidad de la entidad JS. Más concretamente, la entidad se normaliza la generosidad según lo percibe la entidad J es GJ (i) = G (i)/G (J).(2) En el resto de esta sección, describimos nuestro marco de simulación y lo usamos para demostrar los beneficios de la función de decisión reciprocativa basal.

Utilizamos la matriz de pagos de intercambio de archivos asimétricos (Figura 3) con deserciones no rastreables porque modela las transacciones en muchos sistemas P2P como el intercambio de archivos y el reenvío de paquetes en las redes AD-hoc y superpuesto. Nuestro estudio de simulación está compuesto por diferentes escenarios que reflejan los desafíos de varios comportamientos no cooperativos. La Tabla 1 presenta los valores de parámetros nominales utilizados en nuestra simulación. La relación con filas se refiere a la relación inicial de la población total utilizando una estrategia particular. En cada escenario variamos el rango de valor de un parámetro específico para reflejar una situación o ataque particular. Luego variamos las propiedades exactas de la estrategia reciprocativa para defenderse de esa situación o ataque.3.2 Resultados de línea de base 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Tiempo de población (a) Total Población: 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Tiempo (b) Población total: 120 Cooperator de desertores Recipe. Figura privada 4: La evolución de las poblaciones de estrategia a lo largo del tiempo. Tiempo el número de rondas transcurridas. La población es el número de jugadores que usan una estrategia. En esta sección, presentamos la dinámica del juego para el escenario básico presentado en la Tabla 1 para familiarizar al lector y establecer una línea de base para escenarios más complicados. Las Figuras 4 (a) (60 jugadores) y (b) (120 jugadores) muestran a los jugadores que cambian a estrategias de puntuación más altas con el tiempo en dos carreras separadas del simulador. Cada punto en el gráfico representa el número de jugadores que usan una estrategia particular en un momento en el tiempo. Las figuras 5 (a) y (b) muestran la puntuación general media correspondiente por ronda. Esto mide el grado de cooperación en el sistema: 6 es el máximo posible (logrado cuando todos cooperan) y 0 es el mínimo (logrado cuando todos deserve). Desde la matriz de pago para compartir archivos, una red de 6 significa que todos pueden descargar un archivo y un 0 significa que nadie 105 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Mediaverallscore/Tiempo redondo (a) Población total:60 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Tiempo (b) Población total: 120 Figura 5: La puntuación media por ronda general con el tiempo.es capaz de hacerlo. Utilizamos esta métrica en todos los resultados posteriores para evaluar nuestras técnicas de incentivos. La Figura 5 (a) muestra que la estrategia recíproca que usa la historia privada hace que un sistema de 60 jugadores converja a un nivel de cooperación de 3.7, pero cae a 0.5 para 120 jugadores. Uno esperaría que el sistema de 60 jugadores alcance el nivel óptimo de cooperación (6) porque todos los desertores se eliminan del sistema. No lo hace por asimetría de interés. Por ejemplo, suponga que el Jugador B está utilizando el recíproco con la historia privada. El jugador A puede solicitar el servicio del Jugador B dos veces en sucesión sin proporcionar servicio al Jugador B mientras tanto. El jugador B no sabe del servicio que el jugador A ha brindado a otros, por lo que el jugador B rechazará el servicio al jugador A, a pesar de que el jugador A es cooperativo. Discutimos soluciones a la asimetría de interés y la falla del recíproco en el sistema de 120 reproductores en la Sección 4.1.4. Técnicas de incentivos basados en el recíproco En esta sección presentamos nuestras técnicas de incentivos y evaluamos su comportamiento por simulación. Para aclarar la exposición, agrupamos nuestras técnicas por los desafíos que abordan: grandes poblaciones y alta rotación (Sección 4.1), colusiones (Sección 4.2), identidades de costo cero (Sección 4.3) y traidores (Sección 4.4).4.1 Grandes poblaciones y una alta rotación Las grandes poblaciones y la alta rotación de los sistemas P2P hacen que sea menos probable que ocurran interacciones repetidas con una entidad familiar. En estas condiciones, basar las decisiones solo en la historia privada (registros sobre interacciones que el par ha estado involucrado directamente) no es efectivo. Además, la historia privada no trata bien con la asimetría de interés. Por ejemplo, si el jugador B ha cooperado con otros, pero no con el jugador A mismo en el pasado, el jugador A no tiene indicios de la generosidad del jugador BS, por lo que puede defectarse indebidamente de él. Proponemos dos mecanismos para aliviar el problema de pocas transacciones repetidas: la selección del servidor y el historial compartido.4.1.1 Selección del servidor Una forma natural de aumentar la probabilidad de interactuar con pares familiares es discriminar la selección del servidor. Sin embargo, la asimetría de las transacciones desafía los mecanismos de selección. A diferencia de la matriz de pago del dilema de los prisioneros, donde los jugadores pueden beneficiarse entre sí dentro de una sola transacción, las transacciones en GPD son asimétricas. Como resultado, un jugador que selecciona a su donante por segunda vez sin contribuir con ella mientras tanto puede enfrentar una deserción. Además, debido a la no identificación de las deserciones, es imposible mantener listas negras para evitar interacciones con desertores conocidos. Para lidiar con transacciones asimétricas, cada jugador contiene (tamaño fijo) listas de donantes anteriores y destinatarios anteriores, y selecciona un servidor de una de estas listas al azar con probabilidades iguales. De esta manera, los usuarios se acercan a sus destinatarios pasados y les dan la oportunidad de corresponder. En escenarios con usuarios selectivos omitimos la suposición de disponibilidad completa para evitar que los jugadores se agrupen en muchos grupos muy pequeños;Por lo tanto, suponemos que cada jugador puede realizar el servicio solicitado con probabilidad P (para los resultados presentados en esta sección, p = .3). Además, para evitar el sesgo a favor de los jugadores selectivos, todos los jugadores (incluidos los no discriminativos) seleccionan servidores para juegos. La Figura 6 demuestra la efectividad del mecanismo de selección propuesto en escenarios con grandes tamaños de población. Fijamos la relación inicial de recíproco en la población (33%) mientras variamos el tamaño de la población (entre 24 y 1000) (observe que, mientras que en las Figuras 4 (a) y (b), los puntos de datos demuestran la evolución del sistema sobreTiempo, cada punto de datos en esta figura es el resultado de una simulación completa para un escenario específico). La figura muestra que la función de decisión reciprocativa que utiliza la historia privada junto con el comportamiento selectivo puede escalar a grandes poblaciones. En la Figura 7 fijamos el tamaño de la población y variamos la tasa de rotación. Demuestra que si bien el comportamiento selectivo es efectivo para las bajas tasas de rotación, a medida que la facturación aumenta, el comportamiento selectivo no escala. Esto ocurre porque la selección solo es efectiva siempre que los jugadores del pasado permanezcan vivos durante el tiempo suficiente para que puedan ser seleccionados para futuros juegos.4.1.2 Historia compartida Para mitigar la asimetría de interés y escala a una tasa de facturación más alta, es necesario en la historia compartida. La historia compartida significa que cada par mantiene registros sobre todas las interacciones que ocurren en el sistema, independientemente de si estaba directamente involucrado en ellas o no. Permite a los jugadores aprovechar las experiencias de otros en casos de pocas transacciones repetidas. Solo requiere que alguien haya interactuado con un jugador en particular para que toda la población lo observe, por lo tanto, escala mejor a grandes poblaciones y altas pérdidas de balón, y también tolera la asimetría de interés. Algunos ejemplos de esquemas de historia compartida son [20] [23] [28]. La Figura 7 muestra la efectividad de la historia compartida bajo altas tasas de rotación. En esta figura, fijamos el tamaño de la población y variamos la tasa de rotación. Si bien los jugadores selectivos con historia privada solo pueden tolerar una facturación moderada, compartió la historia de las pérdidas de balón de hasta aproximadamente 0.1. Esto significa que el 10% de los jugadores abandonan el sistema al final de cada ronda. En la Figura 6 fijamos la rotación y variamos el tamaño de la población. Muestra que el historial compartido hace que el sistema converja con una cooperación y rendimiento óptimos, independientemente del tamaño de la población. Estos resultados muestran que el historial compartido aborda los tres desafíos de las grandes poblaciones, la alta rotación y la asimetría de las transacciones. Sin embargo, la historia compartida tiene dos desventajas.

El eje X es la tasa de rotación. El eje Y es el puntaje medio por ronda general.Si bien una implementación descentralizada de la historia privada es directa, la implementación de la historia compartida requiere gastos generales o centralización de comunicación. Se puede implementar un historial compartido descentralizado, por ejemplo, además de un DHT, utilizando un sistema de almacenamiento entre pares [36] o difundiendo información a otras entidades de manera similar a los protocolos de enrutamiento. Segundo, y la historia compartida más fundamental es vulnerable a la colusión. En la siguiente sección proponemos un mecanismo que aborde este problema.4.2 Colusión y otros ataques de historia compartida 4.2.1 Colusión Si bien la historia compartida es escalable, es vulnerable a la colusión. La colusión puede ser positiva (por ejemplo, las entidades de defectos afirman que otras entidades de defectos cooperaron con ellas) o negativas (por ejemplo, las entidades afirman que otras entidades cooperativas desertaron). La colusión subvierte cualquier estrategia en la que todos en el sistema estén de acuerdo con la reputación de un jugador (reputación objetiva). Un ejemplo de reputación objetiva es utilizar la función de decisión recíproca con un historial compartido para contar el número total de cooperaciones que un jugador ha dado y recibido de todas las entidades del sistema;Otro ejemplo es la estrategia de imagen [28]. El efecto de la colusión se amplía en sistemas con identidades de costo cero, donde los usuarios pueden crear identidades falsas que informan declaraciones falsas. En cambio, para lidiar con la colusión, las entidades pueden calcular la reputación subjetiva, donde el jugador A pesa las opiniones del jugador BS en función de cuánto jugador fideos un jugador B. Nuestro algoritmo subjetivo se basa en MaxFlow [24] [32]. Maxflow es un problema teórico de gráfico, que dado un gráfico dirigido con bordes ponderados, pregunta cuál es la mayor tasa a la que el material se puede enviar desde la fuente al objetivo sin violar ninguna restricción de capacidad. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 8, cada borde está etiquetado con la cantidad de tráfico que puede viajar sobre él. El algoritmo MaxFlow calcula la cantidad máxima de tráfico que puede pasar de la (s) fuente (s) al objetivo (t) sin violar las restricciones. En este ejemplo, a pesar de que hay un bucle de bordes de alta capacidad, el flujo máximo entre la fuente y el objetivo es solo 2 (los números en los soportes representan el flujo real en cada borde en la solución).100 (0) 1 (1) 5 (1) S T 10 (1) 100 (1) 1 (1) 100 (1) 20 (0) Figura 8: Cada borde en el gráfico está etiquetado con su capacidad y el flujo realLleva entre paréntesis. El máximo flujo entre la fuente y el destino en el gráfico es 2.

Aplicamos el algoritmo Maxflow construyendo un gráfico cuyos vértices son entidades y los bordes son los servicios que las entidades se han recibido entre sí. Esta información se puede almacenar utilizando los mismos métodos que el historial compartido. Un máximo de flujo es el mayor nivel de reputación que la fuente puede dar al fregadero sin violar las limitaciones de la capacidad de reputación. Como resultado, los nodos que informan deshonestamente valores de reputación altos no podrán subvertir el sistema de reputación. La Figura 9 ilustra un escenario en el que todos los coludentes (etiquetados con C) informan altos valores de reputación entre sí. Cuando el nodo A calcula la reputación subjetiva de B utilizando el algoritmo Maxflow, no se verá afectado por los valores locales de reputación falsa, sino que el máximo flujo en este caso será 0. Esto se debe a que no se ha recibido ningún servicio de ninguno de los Colluders.107 En nuestro algoritmo, el beneficio que ha recibido (indirectamente) de la entidad J es el máximo de Jlow de J a I.Por el contrario, el beneficio de que la entidad que he proporcionado indirectamente a J es el máximo de flujo de i a j. La reputación subjetiva de la entidad j como se percibe por i es: min maxflow (j a i) maxflow (i to j), 1 (3) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 MENTOOverallScore/La población redonda compartió la Figura 10 privada: Historia subjetiva compartida en comparación con la historia compartida objetiva y la historia privada en presencia de coluders.

El algoritmo estándar de preflowpush maxflow tiene el peor de los casos de ejecución de O (v 3). En cambio, usamos el Algoritmo 1 que tiene un tiempo de ejecución medio constante, pero a veces no devuelve ningún flujo a pesar de que existe uno. La idea esencial es limitar el número medio de nodos examinados durante el cálculo del flujo máximo. Esto limita la sobrecarga, pero también limita la efectividad. A pesar de esto, los resultados a continuación muestran que una función de decisión reciprocativa basada en Maxflow escala a poblaciones más altas que una que usa historia privada. La Figura 10 compara la efectividad de la reputación subjetiva con la reputación objetiva en presencia de coluders. En estos escenarios, los desertores coluden al afirmar que otros coludentes que encuentran les dieron 100 cooperaciones para ese encuentro. Además, los parámetros para el algoritmo 1 se establecen de la siguiente manera: incremento = 100, α = 0.9. Como en secciones anteriores, el recíproco con la historia privada da como resultado una cooperación hasta un punto, más allá del cual falla. La diferencia aquí es que la historia compartida objetiva falla para todos los tamaños de población. Esto se debe a que los jugadores recíprocos cooperan con los Colluders debido a su alta reputación. Sin embargo, la historia subjetiva puede alcanzar altos niveles de cooperación independientemente de los coluders. Esto se debe a que no hay rutas de alto peso en el gráfico de cooperación de coluders a cualquier no coludencia, por lo que el máximo flujo de un coludero a cualquier no coludor es 0. Por lo tanto, un jugador recíproco subjetivo concluirá que Colluder no le ha brindado ningún servicio y rechazará el servicio al coludero. Por lo tanto, el algoritmo Maxflow permite al recíproco mantener la escalabilidad de la historia compartida sin ser vulnerable a la colusión o requerir confianza centralizada (por ejemplo, pares de confianza). Dado que vinculamos el tiempo de ejecución del algoritmo Maxflow, la cooperación disminuye a medida que aumenta el tamaño de la población, pero el punto clave es que la función de decisión recíproca subjetiva escala a poblaciones más altas que una que usa historia privada. Esta ventaja solo aumenta con el tiempo a medida que aumenta la potencia de la CPU y se pueden dedicar más ciclos a ejecutar el algoritmo de flujo máximo (al aumentar el parámetro de incremento). A pesar de la robustez del algoritmo Maxflow a la forma simple de colusión descrita anteriormente, todavía tiene vulnerabilidades a ataques más sofisticados. Uno es que una entidad (el topo) brinde servicio y luego se encuentre positivamente sobre otros coluders. Los otros Colluders pueden explotar su reputación para recibir el servicio. Sin embargo, la efectividad de este ataque se basa en la cantidad de servicio que brinda el lunar. Dado que el topo está pagando todo el costo de proporcionar servicio y no recibir nada de beneficio, tiene un fuerte incentivo para dejar de coludir y probar otra estrategia. Esto obliga a los coluderos a usar mecanismos para mantener la cooperación dentro de su grupo, lo que puede impulsar el costo de la colusión para exceder el beneficio.4.2.2 Informes falsos Otro ataque es que un desertor mienta sobre recibir o prestar servicio a otra entidad. Hay cuatro acciones posibles sobre las cuales se pueden mentir: proporcionar servicio, no proporcionar servicio, recibir servicio y no recibir servicio. Afirmar falsamente de recibir el servicio es el simple ataque de colusión descrito anteriormente. Reclamar falsamente no haber prestado servicio no proporciona ningún beneficio para el atacante. Afirmar falsamente de haber prestado servicio o no haberlo recibido le permite a un atacante aumentar su propia reputación y/o reducir la reputación de otra entidad. Una entidad puede querer reducir la reputación de otras entidades para desanimar a otros a seleccionarla y usar exclusivamente su servicio. Estas afirmaciones falsas son claramente identificables en la historia compartida como inconsistencias en las que una entidad afirma que ocurrió una transacción y otra afirma que no lo hizo. Para limitar este ataque, modificamos el algoritmo máximo de flujo para que una entidad siempre crea la entidad que está más cerca de él en el gráfico de flujo. Si ambas entidades son igualmente distantes, entonces el borde en disputa en el flujo no es crítico para la evaluación y se ignora. Esta modificación impide aquellos casos en los que el atacante está haciendo afirmaciones falsas sobre una entidad que está más cerca que ella a la entidad evaluadora, lo que le impide impulsar su propia reputación. Las posibilidades restantes son que el atacante afirme falsamente haber prestado servicio a o no haberlo recibido de una entidad víctima que está más lejos del evaluador que ella. En estos casos, un atacante solo puede reducir la reputación de la víctima. La efectividad de hacer esto está limitada por la cantidad de servicios prestados y recibidos por el atacante, lo que hace que ejecutar este ataque sea costoso.108 4.3 Identidades de costo cero El historial supone que las entidades mantienen identidades persistentes. Sin embargo, en la mayoría de los sistemas P2P, las identidades son de costo cero. Esto es deseable para el crecimiento de la red, ya que alienta a los recién llegados a unirse al sistema. Sin embargo, esto también permite que los usuarios de mal comportamiento escapar de las consecuencias de sus acciones cambiando a nuevas identidades (es decir, blanqueo). Los blanqueadores pueden hacer que el sistema colapse si no son castigados adecuadamente. Desafortunadamente, un jugador no puede decir si un extraño es un blanqueador o un recién llegado legítimo. Siempre cooperar con extraños alienta a los recién llegados a unirse, pero al mismo tiempo alienta el comportamiento de blanqueo. Siempre desertar a los extraños evita que el blanqueo, pero desalienta a los recién llegados a unirse y también puede iniciar ciclos desfavorables de deserción. Esta tensión sugiere que cualquier política más extraña que tenga una probabilidad fija de cooperar con extraños fallará al ser demasiado tacaño cuando la mayoría de los extraños son recién llegados o demasiado generosos cuando la mayoría de los extraños son blanqueadores. Nuestra solución es la política de extraños adaptativos de Stranger. La idea es ser generoso para extraños cuando están siendo generosos y tacaños cuando son tacaños. Deje que PS y CS sean el número de servicios que los extraños han brindado y consumido, respectivamente. La probabilidad de que un jugador que use Stranger Adaptive ayude a un extraño es PS/CS. Sin embargo, no deseamos mantener estos recuentos de forma permanente (por razones descritas en la Sección 4.4). Además, los jugadores pueden no saber cuándo los extraños defectos porque las deserciones no se pueden rastrear (como se describe en la Sección 2). En consecuencia, en lugar de mantener PS y CS, suponemos que K = PS + CS, donde K es una constante y mantenemos la relación de ejecución r = PS/CS. Cuando necesitamos incrementar PS o CS, generamos los valores actuales de PS y CS de K y R: CS = K/(1 + R) PS = CS ∗ R Luego calculamos la nueva R como sigue: R = (PS+ 1)/cs, si el extraño proporcionó el servicio r = ps/(cs + 1), si el servicio consumido por el extraño, este método nos permite mantener una relación de ejecución que refleja la reciente generosidad de extraños sin saber cuándo han desertado extraños.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 MediaverAllscore/Round Ratever Stranger Coopere Defect Stranger Stranger Figura 11: Diferentes políticas más extrañas para recíprocos con historia compartida.

El eje Y es el puntaje medio por ronda general.Compara diferentes políticas de extraños para el recíproco con la historia compartida, mientras que la Figura 12 es con la historia privada. En ambas cifras, los jugadores que usan la estrategia de defectos del 100% cambian su identidad (blanqueo) después de cada transacción y son indistinguibles de los recién llegados legítimos. Los jugadores reciprocativos que usan la política de Coopere Stranger no logran la cooperación. Esta política de extraños permite que los blanqueadores maximicen su recompensa y, en consecuencia, proporciona un alto incentivo para que los usuarios cambien a blanqueo. En contraste, la Figura 11 muestra que la política de defectos de los extraños es efectiva con la historia compartida. Esto se debe a que los blanqueadores siempre parecen ser extraños y, por lo tanto, los jugadores reciprocativos siempre los desertarán. Esto es consistente con el trabajo previo [13] que demuestra que castigar a los extraños se ocupa de los blanqueadores. Sin embargo, la Figura 12 muestra que el defecto más extraño no es efectivo con la historia privada. Esto se debe a que el recíproco requiere cierta cooperación inicial para el arranque. En el caso de la historia compartida, un jugador recíproco puede observar que otro jugador ya ha cooperado con otros. Con la historia privada, el jugador recíproco solo conoce las acciones de los otros jugadores hacia ella. Por lo tanto, la deserción inicial dictada por la Política de defectos de los extraños conducirá a deserciones posteriores, lo que evitará que los jugadores recíprocos cooperen entre sí. En otras simulaciones que no se muestran aquí, la política de Stranger Defect Stranger falla incluso con el historial compartido cuando no hay jugadores iniciales del 100% cooperado. La Figura 11 muestra que con la historia compartida, la política adaptativa de extraños funciona, así como la política de defectos de los extraños hasta que la tasa de rotación es muy alta (el 10% de la población se dio la vuelta después de cada transacción). En estos escenarios, Stranger Adaptive está usando K = 10 y cada jugador mantiene una R privada.Más importante aún, es significativamente mejor que la política de defectos de extraños con la historia privada porque puede arrancar la cooperación. Aunque la política de defectos más extraños es marginalmente más efectiva que la adaptación más extraña a tasas muy altas de rotación, es poco probable que los sistemas P2P funcionen allí porque otros servicios (por ejemplo, enrutamiento) tampoco pueden tolerar una facturación muy alta. Llegamos a la conclusión de que de las políticas más extrañas que hemos explorado, Stranger Adaptive es el más efectivo. Mediante el uso de Stranger Adaptive, los sistemas P2P con identidades de costo cero y una rotación suficientemente baja pueden mantener la cooperación sin una asignación centralizada de identidades.109 4.4 Traidores Traidores son jugadores que adquieren puntuaciones de alta reputación al cooperar por un tiempo, y luego se convierten traidoriamente en desertores antes de abandonar el sistema. Modelan a ambos usuarios que se vuelven deliberadamente para obtener una puntuación más alta y los cooperadores cuyas identidades han sido robadas y explotadas por los desertores. Una estrategia que mantiene la historia a largo plazo sin discriminar entre acciones antiguas y recientes se vuelve altamente vulnerable a la explotación por parte de estos traidores. Los dos gráficos principales en la Figura 13 demuestran el efecto de los traidores en la cooperación en un sistema donde los jugadores mantienen la historia a largo plazo (nunca la historia clara). En estas simulaciones, corremos para 2000 rondas y permitimos a los jugadores cooperativos mantener sus identidades al cambiar a la estrategia del 100% del desertor. Usamos los valores predeterminados para los otros parámetros. Sin traidores, las estrategias cooperativas prosperan. Con los traidores, las estrategias cooperativas prosperan hasta que un cooperador se convierte en traidor después de 600 rondas. A medida que este cooperador explota su reputación para lograr una puntuación alta, otros jugadores cooperativos notan esto y hacen lo mismo a través del aprendizaje. La cooperación finalmente se derrumba. Por otro lado, si mantenemos historia a corto plazo y/o descuentos en la historia antigua frente a la historia reciente, los traidores pueden detectarse rápidamente, y el nivel de cooperación general se mantiene alto, como se muestra en los dos gráficos inferiores en la Figura 130 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Holección a largo plazo No Traidor Población 0 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Traidores Cooperator Defector Recipe.

Trabajo relacionado El trabajo anterior ha examinado el problema de incentivos aplicados a las sociedades en general y más recientemente a aplicaciones de Internet y sistemas de igual a igual en particular. Un fenómeno bien conocido en este contexto es la tragedia de los bienes comunes [18] donde los recursos son inocentes debido a usuarios egoístas que viajan libremente en los recursos de los sistemas, y es especialmente común en grandes redes [29] [3]. El problema se ha estudiado ampliamente adoptando un enfoque teórico del juego. El modelo de dilema de prisioneros proporciona un marco natural para estudiar la efectividad de las diferentes estrategias para establecer la cooperación entre los jugadores. En un entorno de simulación con muchos juegos repetidos, identidades persistentes y sin colusión, Axelrod [4] muestra que la estrategia TIT-for-Tat domina. Nuestro modelo asume que el crecimiento sigue el aprendizaje local en lugar de la dinámica evolutiva [14], y también permite más tipos de ataques. Nowak y Sigmund [28] introducen la estrategia de imagen y demuestran su capacidad para establecer la cooperación entre los jugadores a pesar de las pocas transacciones repetidas por el empleo de la historia compartida. Los jugadores que usan imágenes cooperan con jugadores cuyo recuento global de cooperaciones menos deserciones excede algún umbral. Como resultado, un jugador de imagen es vulnerable a los desertores parciales (si el umbral se establece demasiado bajo) o no coopera con otros reproductores de imagen (si el umbral se establece demasiado). En los últimos años, los investigadores han utilizado la teoría del diseño del mecanismo económico para abordar el problema de cooperación en aplicaciones de Internet. El diseño del mecanismo es el inverso de la teoría del juego. Pregunta cómo diseñar un juego en el que el comportamiento de los jugadores estratégicos resulte en el resultado socialmente deseado. El diseño de mecanismo algorítmico distribuido busca soluciones dentro de este marco que están completamente distribuidos y computacionalmente manejables [12].[10] y [11] son ejemplos de aplicar DAMD al enrutamiento BGP y costos compartidos de multidifusión. Más recientemente, Damd también se ha estudiado en entornos dinámicos [38]. En este contexto, demostrar la superioridad de una estrategia cooperativa (como en el caso de nuestro trabajo) es consistente con el objetivo de incentivar el comportamiento deseado entre los jugadores egoístas. Los desafíos únicos impuestos por los sistemas de igual a igual inspiraron un cuerpo adicional de trabajo [5] [37], principalmente en el contexto del reenvío de paquetes en el enrutamiento inalámbrico ad-hoc [8] [27] [30] [35], yCompartir archivos [15] [31]. Friedman y Resnick [13] consideran el problema de las identidades de costo cero en entornos en línea y descubren que en tales sistemas castigar a todos los recién llegados es inevitable. Usando un modelo teórico, demuestran que dicho sistema puede converger a la cooperación solo para tasas de rotación suficientemente bajas, lo que nuestros resultados confirman.[6] y [9] muestran que el blanqueo y la colusión pueden tener graves consecuencias para los sistemas entre pares y son difíciles de prevenir en un sistema totalmente descentralizado. Algunos clientes comerciales para compartir archivos [1] [2] proporcionan mecanismos de incentivos que se aplican al dificultar que el usuario modifique el código fuente. Estos mecanismos pueden ser evitados por un usuario experto o por una empresa competitiva que libera un cliente compatible sin las restricciones de incentivos. Además, estos mecanismos aún son vulnerables a las identidades y la colusión de costo cero. BitTorrent [7] utiliza TIT-for-Tat como método para la asignación de recursos, donde una tasa de carga de los usuarios dicta su tasa de descarga.6. Conclusiones En este documento adoptamos un enfoque teórico del juego para el problema de la cooperación en las redes entre pares. Al abordar los desafíos impuestos por los sistemas P2P, incluidas las grandes poblaciones, la alta rotación, la asimetría de interés y las identidades de costo cero, proponemos una familia de técnicas de incentivos escalables y robustas, basadas en la función de decisión recíproca, para apoyar el comportamiento cooperativo y mejorar el sistema generalactuación. Encontramos que la adopción de la historia compartida y las técnicas de selección del servidor discriminatorias pueden mitigar el desafío de pocas transacciones repetidas que surgen debido al gran tamaño de la población, una alta rotación y asimetría de interés. Además, la cooperación se puede establecer incluso en presencia de identidades de costo cero mediante el uso de una política adaptativa hacia los extraños. Finalmente, los coluderos y los traidores pueden mantenerse en control a través de la reputación subjetiva y el historial a corto plazo, respectivamente.110 7.

        "Avoiding this tragedy of the commons [18] requires incentives for cooperation.",
        "We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.",
        "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
        "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",
        "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
        "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
        "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
        "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
        "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
        "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",
        "However, if everyone keeps only private history, no one will provide service because B does not know that A has served C, etc.",
        "We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A.",
        "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
        "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
        "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",
        "The basic idea is that B would only believe C if C had already provided service to B.",
        "The cost of the maxflow algorithm is its O(V 3 ) running time, where V is the number of nodes in the system.",
        "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
        "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
        "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
        "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",
        "The peer could be making a strategic decision or someone may have hijacked her identity (e.g., by compromising her host).",
        "Long-term history exacerbates this problem by allowing peers with many previous transactions to exploit that history for many new transactions.",
        "We show that short-term history prevents traitors from disrupting cooperation.",

        "We describe the model in Section 2 and the reciprocative decision function in Section 3.",
        "We then proceed to the incentive techniques in Section 4.",
        "In Section 4.1, we describe the challenges of large populations and high turnover and show the effectiveness of discriminating server selection and shared history.",
        "In Section 4.2, we describe collusion and demonstrate how subjective reputation mitigates it.",
        "In Section 4.3, we present the problem of zero-cost identities and show how an adaptive stranger policy promotes persistent identities.",
        "In Section 4.4, we show how traitors disrupt cooperation and how short-term history deals with them.",
        "We discuss related work in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6. 2.",
        "MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS In this section, we present our assumptions about P2P systems and their users, and introduce a model that aims to capture the behavior of users in a P2P system. 2.1 Assumptions We assume a P2P system in which users are strategic, i.e., they act rationally to maximize their benefit.",
        "However, to capture some of the real-life unpredictability in the behavior of users, we allow users to randomly change their behavior with a low probability (see Section 2.4).",
        "For simplicity, we assume a homogeneous system in which all peers issue and satisfy requests at the same rate.",
        "A peer can satisfy any request, and, unless otherwise specified, peers request service uniformly at random from the population.1 .",
        "Finally, we assume that all transactions incur the same cost to all servers and provide the same benefit to all clients.",
        "We assume that users can pollute shared history with false recommendations (Section 4.2), switch identities at zero-cost (Section 4.3), and spoof other users (Section 4.4).",
        "We do not assume any centralized trust or centralized infrastructure. 2.2 Model To aid the development and study of the incentive schemes, in this section we present a model of the users behaviors.",
        "In particular, we model the benefits and costs of P2P interactions (the game) and population dynamics caused by mutation, learning, and turnover.",
        "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",
        "Transactions should be able to have asymmetric payoffs. • Untraceable Defections: A peer should not be able to determine the identity of peers who have defected on her.",
        "This models the difficulty or expense of determining that a peer could have provided a service, but didnt.",
        "For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma.",
        "T, R, P, and S stand for temptation, reward, punishment and sucker, respectively. 2.3 Generalized Prisoners Dilemma The Prisoners Dilemma, developed by Flood, Dresher, and Tucker in 1950 [22] is a non-cooperative repeated game satisfying the social dilemma requirement.",
        "Each game consists of two players who can defect or cooperate.",
        "Depending how each acts, the players receive a payoff.",
        "The players use a strategy to decide how to act.",
        "Unfortunately, existing work either uses a specific asymmetric payoff matrix or only gives the general form for a symmetric one [4].",
        "Instead, we use the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma (GPD), which specifies the general form for an asymmetric payoff matrix that preserves the social dilemma.",
        "In the GPD, one player is the client and one player is the server in each game, and it is only the decision of the server that is meaningful for determining the outome of the transaction.",
        "A player can be a client in one game and a server in another.",
        "The client and server receive the payoff from a generalized payoff matrix (Figure 2).",
        "Rc, Sc, Tc, and Pc are the clients payoff and Rs, Ss, Ts, and Ps are the servers payoff.",
        "A GPD payoff matrix must have the following properties to create a social dilemma: 1.",
        "Mutual cooperation leads to higher payoffs than mutual defection (Rs + Rc > Ps + Pc). 2.",
        "Mutual cooperation leads to higher payoffs than one player suckering the other (Rs + Rc > Sc + Ts and Rs + Rc > Ss + Tc). 3.",
        "Defection dominates cooperation (at least weakly) at the individual level for the entity who decides whether to cooperate or defect: (Ts ≥ Rs and Ps ≥ Ss and (Ts > Rs or Ps > Ss)) The last set of inequalities assume that clients do not incur a cost regardless of whether they cooperate or defect, and therefore clients always cooperate.",
        "These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma.",
        "Furthermore, one or more of the four possible actions (client cooperate and defect, and server cooperate and defect) can be untraceable.",
        "If one player makes an untraceable action, the other player does not know the identity of the first player.",
        "For example, to model a P2P application like file sharing or overlay routing, we use the specific payoff matrix values shown in Figure 3.",
        "This satisfies the inequalities specified above, where only the server can choose between cooperating and defecting.",
        "In addition, for this particular payoff matrix, clients are unable to trace server defections.",

        "Several studies [4] [28] of repeated Prisoners Dilemma games use an evolutionary model [19] [34] of population dynamics.",
        "An evolutionary model is not suitable for P2P systems because it only specifies the global behavior and all changes occur at discrete times.",
        "For example, it may specify that a population of 5 100% Cooperate players and 5 100% Defect players evolves into a population with 3 and 7 players, respectively.",
        "It does not specify which specific players switched.",
        "Furthermore, all the switching occurs at the end of a generation instead of continuously, like in a real P2P system.",
        "As a result, evolutionary population dynamics do not accurately model turnover, traitors, and strangers.",
        "In our model, entities take independent and continuous actions that change the composition of the population.",
        "Time consists of rounds.",
        "In each round, every player plays one game as a client and one game as a server.",
        "At the end of a round, a player may: 1) mutate 2) learn, 3) turnover, or 4) stay the same.",
        "If a player mutates, she switches to a randomly picked strategy.",
        "If she learns, she switches to a strategy that she believes will produce a higher score (described in more detail below).",
        "If she maintains her identity after switching strategies, then she is referred to as a traitor.",
        "If a player suffers turnover, she leaves the system and is replaced with a newcomer who uses the same strategy as the exiting player.",
        "To learn, a player collects local information about the performance of different strategies.",
        "This information consists of both her personal observations of strategy performance and the observations of those players she interacts with.",
        "This models users communicating out-of-band about how strategies perform.",
        "Let s be the running average of the performance of a players current strategy per round and age be the number of rounds she has been using the strategy.",
        "A strategys rating is RunningAverage(s ∗ age) RunningAverage(age) .",
        "We use the age and compute the running average before the ratio to prevent young samples (which are more likely to be outliers) from skewing the rating.",
        "At the end of a round, a player switches to highest rated strategy with a probability proportional to the difference in score between her current strategy and the highest rated strategy. 104 3.",
        "RECIPROCATIVE DECISION FUNCTION In this section, we present the new decision function, Reciprocative, that is the basis for our incentive techniques.",
        "A decision function maps from a history of a players actions to a decision whether to cooperate with or defect on that player.",
        "A strategy consists of a decision function, private or shared history, a server selection mechanism, and a stranger policy.",
        "Our approach to incentives is to design strategies which maximize both individual and social benefit.",
        "Strategic users will choose to use such strategies and thereby drive the system to high levels of cooperation.",
        "Two examples of simple decision functions are 100% Cooperate and 100% Defect. 100% Cooperate models a naive user who does not yet realize that she is being exploited. 100% Defect models a greedy user who is intent on exploiting the system.",
        "In the absence of incentive techniques, 100% Defect users will quickly dominate the 100% Cooperate users and destroy cooperation in the system.",
        "Our requirements for a decision function are that (1) it can use shared and subjective history, (2) it can deal with untraceable defections, and (3) it is robust against different patterns of defection.",
        "Previous decision functions such as Tit-for-Tat[4] and Image[28] (see Section 5) do not satisfy these criteria.",
        "For example, Tit-for-Tat and Image base their decisions on both cooperations and defections, therefore cannot deal with untraceable defections .",
        "In this section and the remaining sections we demonstrate how the Reciprocativebased strategies satisfy all of the requirements stated above.",
        "The probability that a Reciprocative player cooperates with a peer is a function of its normalized generosity.",
        "Generosity measures the benefit an entity has provided relative to the benefit it has consumed.",

        "To make the exposition clear we group our techniques by the challenges they address: large populations and high turnover (Section 4.1), collusions (Section 4.2), zero-cost identities (Section 4.3), and traitors (Section 4.4). 4.1 Large Populations and High Turnover The large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
        "Under these conditions, basing decisions only on private history (records about interactions the peer has been directly involved in) is not effective.",
        "In addition, private history does not deal well with asymmetry of interest.",
        "For example, if player B has cooperated with others but not with player A himself in the past, player A has no indication of player Bs generosity, thus may unduly defect on him.",
        "We propose two mechanisms to alleviate the problem of few repeat transactions: server-selection and shared history. 4.1.1 Server Selection A natural way to increase the probability of interacting with familiar peers is by discriminating server selection.",
        "However, the asymmetry of transactions challenges selection mechanisms.",
        "Unlike in the prisoners dilemma payoff matrix, where players can benefit one another within a single transaction, transactions in GPD are asymmetric.",
        "As a result, a player who selects her donor for the second time without contributing to her in the interim may face a defection.",
        "In addition, due to untraceability of defections, it is impossible to maintain blacklists to avoid interactions with known defectors.",
        "In order to deal with asymmetric transactions, every player holds (fixed size) lists of both past donors and past recipients, and selects a server from one of these lists at random with equal probabilities.",
        "This way, users approach their past recipients and give them a chance to reciprocate.",
        "In scenarios with selective users we omit the complete availability assumption to prevent players from being clustered into a lot of very small groups; thus, we assume that every player can perform the requested service with probability p (for the results presented in this section, p = .3).",
        "In addition, in order to avoid bias in favor of the selective players, all players (including the non-discriminative ones) select servers for games.",
        "Figure 6 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed selection mechanism in scenarios with large population sizes.",
        "We fix the initial ratio of Reciprocative in the population (33%) while varying the population size (between 24 to 1000) (Notice that while in Figures 4(a) and (b), the data points demonstrates the evolution of the system over time, each data point in this figure is the result of an entire simulation for a specific scenario).",
        "The figure shows that the Reciprocative decision function using private history in conjunction with selective behavior can scale to large populations.",
        "In Figure 7 we fix the population size and vary the turnover rate.",
        "It demonstrates that while selective behavior is effective for low turnover rates, as turnover gets higher, selective behavior does not scale.",
        "This occurs because selection is only effective as long as players from the past stay alive for long enough such that they can be selected for future games. 4.1.2 Shared history In order to mitigate asymmetry of interest and scale to higher turnover rate, there is a need in shared history.",
        "Shared history means that every peer keeps records about all of the interactions that occur in the system, regardless of whether he was directly involved in them or not.",
        "It allows players to leverage off of the experiences of others in cases of few repeat transactions.",
        "It only requires that someone has interacted with a particular player for the entire population to observe it, thus scales better to large populations and high turnovers, and also tolerates asymmetry of interest.",
        "Some examples of shared history schemes are [20] [23] [28].",
        "Figure 7 shows the effectiveness of shared history under high turnover rates.",
        "In this figure, we fix the population size and vary the turnover rate.",
        "While selective players with private history can only tolerate a moderate turnover, shared history scales to turnovers of up to approximately 0.1.",
        "This means that 10% of the players leave the system at the end of each round.",
        "In Figure 6 we fix the turnover and vary the population size.",

        "The x-axis is the turnover rate.",
        "The y-axis is the mean overall per round score. while a decentralized implementation of private history is straightforward, implementation of shared-history requires communication overhead or centralization.",
        "A decentralized shared history can be implemented, for example, on top of a DHT, using a peer-to-peer storage system [36] or by disseminating information to other entities in a similar way to routing protocols.",
        "Second, and more fundamental, shared history is vulnerable to collusion.",
        "In the next section we propose a mechanism that addresses this problem. 4.2 Collusion and Other Shared History Attacks 4.2.1 Collusion While shared history is scalable, it is vulnerable to collusion.",
        "Collusion can be either positive (e.g. defecting entities claim that other defecting entities cooperated with them) or negative (e.g. entities claim that other cooperative entities defected on them).",
        "Collusion subverts any strategy in which everyone in the system agrees on the reputation of a player (objective reputation).",
        "An example of objective reputation is to use the Reciprocative decision function with shared history to count the total number of cooperations a player has given to and received from all entities in the system; another example is the Image strategy [28].",
        "The effect of collusion is magnified in systems with zero-cost identities, where users can create fake identities that report false statements.",
        "Instead, to deal with collusion, entities can compute reputation subjectively, where player A weighs player Bs opinions based on how much player A trusts player B.",
        "Our subjective algorithm is based on maxflow [24] [32].",
        "Maxflow is a graph theoretic problem, which given a directed graph with weighted edges asks what is the greatest rate at which material can be shipped from the source to the target without violating any capacity constraints.",
        "For example, in figure 8 each edge is labeled with the amount of traffic that can travel on it.",
        "The maxflow algorithm computes the maximum amount of traffic that can go from the source (s) to the target (t) without violating the constraints.",

        "We apply the maxflow algorithm by constructing a graph whose vertices are entities and the edges are the services that entities have received from each other.",
        "This information can be stored using the same methods as the shared history.",
        "A maxflow is the greatest level of reputation the source can give to the sink without violating reputation capacity constraints.",

        "This bounds the overhead, but also bounds the effectiveness.",

        "Figure 10 compares the effectiveness of subjective reputation to objective reputation in the presence of colluders.",
        "In these scenarios, defectors collude by claiming that other colluders that they encounter gave them 100 cooperations for that encounter.",
        "Also, the parameters for Algorithm 1 are set as follows: increment = 100, α = 0.9.",
        "As in previous sections, Reciprocative with private history results in cooperation up to a point, beyond which it fails.",
        "The difference here is that objective shared history fails for all population sizes.",
        "This is because the Reciprocative players cooperate with the colluders because of their high reputations.",
        "However, subjective history can reach high levels of cooperation regardless of colluders.",
        "This is because there are no high weight paths in the cooperation graph from colluders to any non-colluders, so the maxflow from a colluder to any non-colluder is 0.",
        "Therefore, a subjective Reciprocative player will conclude that that colluder has not provided any service to her and will reject service to the colluder.",
        "Thus, the maxflow algorithm enables Reciprocative to maintain the scalability of shared history without being vulnerable to collusion or requiring centralized trust (e.g., trusted peers).",
        "Since we bound the running time of the maxflow algorithm, cooperation decreases as the population size increases, but the key point is that the subjective Reciprocative decision function scales to higher populations than one using private history.",
        "This advantage only increases over time as CPU power increases and more cycles can be devoted to running the maxflow algorithm (by increasing the increment parameter).",
        "Despite the robustness of the maxflow algorithm to the simple form of collusion described previously, it still has vulnerabilities to more sophisticated attacks.",
        "One is for an entity (the mole) to provide service and then lie positively about other colluders.",
        "The other colluders can then exploit their reputation to receive service.",
        "However, the effectiveness of this attack relies on the amount of service that the mole provides.",
        "Since the mole is paying all of the cost of providing service and receiving none of the benefit, she has a strong incentive to stop colluding and try another strategy.",
        "This forces the colluders to use mechanisms to maintain cooperation within their group, which may drive the cost of collusion to exceed the benefit. 4.2.2 False reports Another attack is for a defector to lie about receiving or providing service to another entity.",
        "There are four possibile actions that can be lied about: providing service, not providing service, receiving service, and not receiving service.",
        "Falsely claiming to receive service is the simple collusion attack described above.",
        "Falsely claiming not to have provided service provides no benefit to the attacker.",
        "Falsely claiming to have provided service or not to have received it allows an attacker to boost her own reputation and/or lower the reputation of another entity.",
        "An entity may want to lower another entitys reputation in order to discourage others from selecting it and exclusively use its service.",
        "These false claims are clearly identifiable in the shared history as inconsistencies where one entity claims a transaction occurred and another claims it did not.",
        "To limit this attack, we modify the maxflow algorithm so that an entity always believes the entity that is closer to him in the flow graph.",
        "If both entities are equally distant, then the disputed edge in the flow is not critical to the evaluation and is ignored.",
        "This modification prevents those cases where the attacker is making false claims about an entity that is closer than her to the evaluating entity, which prevents her from boosting her own reputation.",
        "The remaining possibilities are for the attacker to falsely claim to have provided service to or not to have received it from a victim entity that is farther from the evalulator than her.",
        "In these cases, an attacker can only lower the reputation of the victim.",
        "The effectiveness of doing this is limited by the number of services provided and received by the attacker, which makes executing this attack expensive. 108 4.3 Zero-Cost Identities History assumes that entities maintain persistent identities.",
        "However, in most P2P systems, identities are zero-cost.",
        "This is desirable for network growth as it encourages newcomers to join the system.",
        "However, this also allows misbehaving users to escape the consequences of their actions by switching to new identities (i.e., whitewashing).",
        "Whitewashers can cause the system to collapse if they are not punished appropriately.",
        "Unfortunately, a player cannot tell if a stranger is a whitewasher or a legitimate newcomer.",
        "Always cooperating with strangers encourages newcomers to join, but at the same time encourages whitewashing behavior.",
        "Always defecting on strangers prevents whitewashing, but discourages newcomers from joining and may also initiate unfavorable cycles of defection.",
        "This tension suggests that any stranger policy that has a fixed probability of cooperating with strangers will fail by either being too stingy when most strangers are newcomers or too generous when most strangers are whitewashers.",
        "Our solution is the Stranger Adaptive stranger policy.",
        "The idea is to be generous to strangers when they are being generous and stingy when they are stingy.",
        "Let ps and cs be the number of services that strangers have provided and consumed, respectively.",
        "The probability that a player using Stranger Adaptive helps a stranger is ps/cs.",
        "However, we do not wish to keep these counts permanently (for reasons described in Section 4.4).",
        "Also, players may not know when strangers defect because defections are untraceable (as described in Section 2).",
        "Consequently, instead of keeping ps and cs, we assume that k = ps + cs, where k is a constant and we keep the running ratio r = ps/cs.",
        "When we need to increment ps or cs, we generate the current values of ps and cs from k and r: cs = k/(1 + r) ps = cs ∗ r We then compute the new r as follows: r = (ps + 1)/cs , if the stranger provided service r = ps/(cs + 1) , if the stranger consumed service This method allows us to keep a running ratio that reflects the recent generosity of strangers without knowing when strangers have defected. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 MeanOverallScore/Round Turnover Stranger Cooperate Stranger Defect Stranger Adaptive Figure 11: Different stranger policies for Reciprocative with shared history.",

        "The Reciprocative players using the Stranger Cooperate policy completely fail to achieve cooperation.",
        "This stranger policy allows whitewashers to maximize their payoff and consequently provides a high incentive for users to switch to whitewashing.",
        "In contrast, Figure 11 shows that the Stranger Defect policy is effective with shared history.",
        "This is because whitewashers always appear to be strangers and therefore the Reciprocative players will always defect on them.",
        "This is consistent with previous work [13] showing that punishing strangers deals with whitewashers.",
        "However, Figure 12 shows that Stranger Defect is not effective with private history.",
        "This is because Reciprocative requires some initial cooperation to bootstrap.",
        "In the shared history case, a Reciprocative player can observe that another player has already cooperated with others.",
        "With private history, the Reciprocative player only knows about the other players actions toward her.",
        "Therefore, the initial defection dictated by the Stranger Defect policy will lead to later defections, which will prevent Reciprocative players from ever cooperating with each other.",
        "In other simulations not shown here, the Stranger Defect stranger policy fails even with shared history when there are no initial 100% Cooperate players.",
        "Figure 11 shows that with shared history, the Stranger Adaptive policy performs as well as Stranger Defect policy until the turnover rate is very high (10% of the population turning over after every transaction).",
        "In these scenarios, Stranger Adaptive is using k = 10 and each player keeps a private r. More importantly, it is significantly better than Stranger Defect policy with private history because it can bootstrap cooperation.",
        "Although the Stranger Defect policy is marginally more effective than Stranger Adaptive at very high rates of turnover, P2P systems are unlikely to operate there because other services (e.g., routing) also cannot tolerate very high turnover.",
        "We conclude that of the stranger policies that we have explored, Stranger Adaptive is the most effective.",
        "By using Stranger Adaptive, P2P systems with zero-cost identities and a sufficiently low turnover can sustain cooperation without a centralized allocation of identities. 109 4.4 Traitors Traitors are players who acquire high reputation scores by cooperating for a while, and then traitorously turn into defectors before leaving the system.",
        "They model both users who turn deliberately to gain a higher score and cooperators whose identities have been stolen and exploited by defectors.",
        "A strategy that maintains longterm history without discriminating between old and recent actions becomes highly vulnerable to exploitation by these traitors.",
        "The top two graphs in Figure 13 demonstrate the effect of traitors on cooperation in a system where players keep long-term history (never clear history).",
        "In these simulations, we run for 2000 rounds and allow cooperative players to keep their identities when switching to the 100% Defector strategy.",
        "We use the default values for the other parameters.",
        "Without traitors, the cooperative strategies thrive.",
        "With traitors, the cooperative strategies thrive until a cooperator turns traitor after 600 rounds.",
        "As this cooperator exploits her reputation to achieve a high score, other cooperative players notice this and follow suit via learning.",
        "Cooperation eventually collapses.",
        "On the other hand, if we maintain short-term history and/or discounting ancient history vis-a-vis recent history, traitors can be quickly detected, and the overall cooperation level stays high, as shown in the bottom two graphs in Figure 13. 0 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Long-TermHistory No Traitors Population 0 20 40 60 80 100 1K 2K Traitors Defector Cooperator Recip.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",

                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "This tension suggests that any stranger policy that has a fixed probability of cooperating with strangers will fail by either being too stingy when most strangers are newcomers or too generous when most strangers are whitewashers.",
                "Our solution is the Stranger Adaptive stranger policy.",

                "In these scenarios, Stranger Adaptive is using k = 10 and each player keeps a private r. More importantly, it is significantly better than Stranger Defect policy with private history because it can bootstrap cooperation.",

                "Avoiding this tragedy of the commons [18] requires incentives for cooperation.",
                "We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.",
                "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",
                "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",
                "However, if everyone keeps only private history, no one will provide service because B does not know that A has served C, etc.",
                "We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A.",
                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a <br>maxflow-based algorithm</br> that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",

                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the <br>maxflow-based algorithm</br> scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "In these scenarios, defectors collude by claiming that other colluders that they encounter gave them 100 cooperations for that encounter.",
                "Also, the parameters for Algorithm 1 are set as follows: increment = 100, α = 0.9.",
                "As in previous sections, Reciprocative with private history results in cooperation up to a point, beyond which it fails.",
                "The difference here is that objective shared history fails for all population sizes.",
                "This is because the Reciprocative players cooperate with the colluders because of their high reputations.",
                "However, subjective history can reach high levels of cooperation regardless of colluders.",
                "This is because there are no high weight paths in the cooperation graph from colluders to any non-colluders, so the maxflow from a colluder to any non-colluder is 0.",
                "Therefore, a subjective Reciprocative player will conclude that that colluder has not provided any service to her and will reject service to the colluder.",
                "Thus, the maxflow algorithm enables Reciprocative to maintain the scalability of shared history without being vulnerable to collusion or requiring centralized trust (e.g., trusted peers).",
                "Since we bound the running time of the maxflow algorithm, cooperation decreases as the population size increases, but the key point is that the subjective Reciprocative decision function scales to higher populations than one using private history.",
                "This advantage only increases over time as CPU power increases and more cycles can be devoted to running the maxflow algorithm (by increasing the increment parameter).",
                "Despite the robustness of the maxflow algorithm to the simple form of collusion described previously, it still has vulnerabilities to more sophisticated attacks.",
                "One is for an entity (the mole) to provide service and then lie positively about other colluders.",

                "Since the mole is paying all of the cost of providing service and receiving none of the benefit, she has a strong incentive to stop colluding and try another strategy.",
                "This forces the colluders to use mechanisms to maintain cooperation within their group, which may drive the cost of collusion to exceed the benefit. 4.2.2 False reports Another attack is for a defector to lie about receiving or providing service to another entity.",
                "There are four possibile actions that can be lied about: providing service, not providing service, receiving service, and not receiving service.",
                "Falsely claiming to receive service is the simple collusion attack described above.",

                "These false claims are clearly identifiable in the shared history as inconsistencies where one entity claims a transaction occurred and another claims it did not.",
                "To limit this attack, we modify the maxflow algorithm so that an entity always believes the entity that is closer to him in the flow graph.",
                "If both entities are equally distant, then the disputed edge in the flow is not critical to the evaluation and is ignored.",
                "This modification prevents those cases where the attacker is making false claims about an entity that is closer than her to the evaluating entity, which prevents her from boosting her own reputation.",
                "The remaining possibilities are for the attacker to falsely claim to have provided service to or not to have received it from a victim entity that is farther from the evalulator than her.",
                "In these cases, an attacker can only lower the reputation of the victim.",
                "The effectiveness of doing this is limited by the number of services provided and received by the attacker, which makes executing this attack expensive. 108 4.3 Zero-Cost Identities History assumes that entities maintain persistent identities.",
                "However, in most P2P systems, identities are zero-cost.",
                "This is desirable for network growth as it encourages newcomers to join the system.",

                "Whitewashers can cause the system to collapse if they are not punished appropriately.",
                "Unfortunately, a player cannot tell if a stranger is a whitewasher or a legitimate newcomer.",
                "Always cooperating with strangers encourages newcomers to join, but at the same time encourages whitewashing behavior.",
                "Always defecting on strangers prevents whitewashing, but discourages newcomers from joining and may also initiate unfavorable cycles of defection.",
                "This tension suggests that any stranger policy that has a fixed probability of cooperating with strangers will fail by either being too stingy when most strangers are newcomers or too generous when most strangers are whitewashers.",
                "Our solution is the Stranger Adaptive stranger policy.",
                "The idea is to be generous to strangers when they are being generous and stingy when they are stingy.",
                "Let ps and cs be the number of services that strangers have provided and consumed, respectively.",
                "The probability that a player using Stranger Adaptive helps a stranger is ps/cs.",
                "However, we do not wish to keep these counts permanently (for reasons described in Section 4.4).",
                "Also, players may not know when strangers defect because defections are untraceable (as described in Section 2).",
                "Consequently, instead of keeping ps and cs, we assume that k = ps + cs, where k is a constant and we keep the running ratio r = ps/cs.",
                "When we need to increment ps or cs, we generate the current values of ps and cs from k and r: cs = k/(1 + r) ps = cs ∗ r We then compute the new r as follows: r = (ps + 1)/cs , if the stranger provided service r = ps/(cs + 1) , if the stranger consumed service This method allows us to keep a running ratio that reflects the recent generosity of strangers without knowing when strangers have defected. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 MeanOverallScore/Round Turnover Stranger Cooperate Stranger Defect Stranger Adaptive Figure 11: Different stranger policies for Reciprocative with shared history.",

                "With private history, the Reciprocative player only knows about the other players actions toward her.",
                "Therefore, the initial defection dictated by the Stranger Defect policy will lead to later defections, which will prevent Reciprocative players from ever cooperating with each other.",

                "In these scenarios, Stranger Adaptive is using k = 10 and each player keeps a private r. More importantly, it is significantly better than Stranger Defect policy with private history because it can bootstrap cooperation.",
                "Although the Stranger Defect policy is marginally more effective than Stranger Adaptive at very high rates of turnover, P2P systems are unlikely to operate there because other services (e.g., routing) also cannot tolerate very high turnover.",

                "By using Stranger Adaptive, P2P systems with zero-cost identities and a sufficiently low turnover can sustain cooperation without a centralized allocation of identities. 109 4.4 Traitors Traitors are players who acquire high reputation scores by cooperating for a while, and then traitorously turn into defectors before leaving the system.",
                "They model both users who turn deliberately to gain a higher score and cooperators whose identities have been stolen and exploited by defectors.",
                "A strategy that maintains longterm history without discriminating between old and recent actions becomes highly vulnerable to exploitation by these traitors.",
                "The top two graphs in Figure 13 demonstrate the effect of traitors on cooperation in a system where players keep long-term history (never clear history).",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",

                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the <br>reciprocative decision function</br> can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",

                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",

                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",

                "Avoiding this tragedy of the commons [18] requires incentives for cooperation.",
                "We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.",
                "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",
                "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",

                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",
                "The basic idea is that B would only believe C if C had already provided service to B.",

                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",

                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",

                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "In many of these systems, users have natural disincentives to cooperate because cooperation consumes their own resources and may degrade their own performance.",

                "Avoiding this tragedy of the commons [18] requires incentives for cooperation.",
                "We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.",
                "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",
                "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust <br>incentive</br> techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",
                "However, if everyone keeps only private history, no one will provide service because B does not know that A has served C, etc.",
                "We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A.",
                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",
                "The basic idea is that B would only believe C if C had already provided service to B.",
                "The cost of the maxflow algorithm is its O(V 3 ) running time, where V is the number of nodes in the system.",
                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little <br>incentive</br> to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",
                "The peer could be making a strategic decision or someone may have hijacked her identity (e.g., by compromising her host).",
                "Long-term history exacerbates this problem by allowing peers with many previous transactions to exploit that history for many new transactions.",

                "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",
                "Transactions should be able to have asymmetric payoffs. • Untraceable Defections: A peer should not be able to determine the identity of peers who have defected on her.",

                "For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma.",

                "These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "However, to capture some of the real-life unpredictability in the behavior of users, we allow users to randomly change their behavior with a low probability (see Section 2.4).",

                "We adopt a game-theoretic approach in addressing this problem.",
                "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",
                "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",

                "We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A.",
                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",

                "The cost of the maxflow algorithm is its O(V 3 ) running time, where V is the number of nodes in the system.",
                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",
                "Transactions should be able to have asymmetric payoffs. • Untraceable Defections: A peer should not be able to determine the identity of peers who have defected on her.",

                "For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma.",

                "These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma.",

                "For example, if player B has cooperated with others but not with player A himself in the past, player A has no indication of player Bs generosity, thus may unduly defect on him.",
                "We propose two mechanisms to alleviate the problem of few repeat transactions: server-selection and shared history. 4.1.1 Server Selection A natural way to increase the probability of interacting with familiar peers is by discriminating server selection.",

                "In addition, due to untraceability of defections, it is impossible to maintain blacklists to avoid interactions with known defectors.",
                "In order to deal with asymmetric transactions, every player holds (fixed size) lists of both past donors and past recipients, and selects a server from one of these lists at random with equal probabilities.",
                "This way, users approach their past recipients and give them a chance to reciprocate.",
                "In scenarios with selective users we omit the complete availability assumption to prevent players from being clustered into a lot of very small groups; thus, we assume that every player can perform the requested service with probability p (for the results presented in this section, p = .3).",
                "In addition, in order to avoid bias in favor of the selective players, all players (including the non-discriminative ones) select servers for games.",

                "This occurs because selection is only effective as long as players from the past stay alive for long enough such that they can be selected for future games. 4.1.2 Shared history In order to mitigate asymmetry of interest and scale to higher turnover rate, there is a need in shared history.",
                "Shared history means that every peer keeps records about all of the interactions that occur in the system, regardless of whether he was directly involved in them or not.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "In particular, we use a prisoners dilemma model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",

                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",

                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for <br>collusion</br>.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",

                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",
                "Transactions should be able to have asymmetric payoffs. • Untraceable Defections: A peer should not be able to determine the identity of peers who have defected on her.",

                "For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma.",

                "Defection dominates cooperation (at least weakly) at the individual level for the entity who decides whether to cooperate or defect: (Ts ≥ Rs and Ps ≥ Ss and (Ts > Rs or Ps > Ss)) The last set of inequalities assume that clients do not incur a cost regardless of whether they cooperate or defect, and therefore clients always cooperate.",
                "These properties correspond to similar properties of the classic Prisoners Dilemma and allow any form of asymmetric transaction while still creating a social dilemma.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",

                "Our model is designed to have the following properties that characterize a large set of P2P systems: • Social Dilemma: Universal cooperation should result in optimal overall utility, but individuals who exploit the cooperation of others while not cooperating themselves (i.e., defecting) should benefit more than users who do cooperate. • Asymmetric Transactions: A peer may want service from another peer while not currently being able to provide the service that the second peer wants.",

                "For example, in the Gnutella file sharing system [21], a peer may simply ignore queries despite possessing the desired file, thus preventing the querying peer from identifying the defecting peer. • Dynamic Population: Peers should be able to change their behavior and enter or leave the system independently and continuously. 1The exception is discussed in Section 4.1.1 103 Cooperate Defect Cooperate DefectClient Server sc RR / sc ST / sc PP / sc TS / Figure 2: Payoff matrix for the Generalized Prisoners Dilemma.",

                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., <br>whitewash</br>).",
                "Strategies that work well in traditional prisoners dilemma games such as Tit-for-Tat [4] will not fare well in the P2P context.",
                "Therefore, we propose a family of scalable and robust incentive techniques, based upon a novel Reciprocative decision function, to address these challenges and provide different tradeoffs: • Discriminating Server Selection: Cooperation requires familiarity between entities either directly or indirectly.",
                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",
                "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",
                "However, if everyone keeps only private history, no one will provide service because B does not know that A has served C, etc.",
                "We show that with shared history, B knows that A served C and consequently will serve A.",
                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",
                "The basic idea is that B would only believe C if C had already provided service to B.",
                "The cost of the maxflow algorithm is its O(V 3 ) running time, where V is the number of nodes in the system.",
                "To eliminate this cost, we have developed a constant mean running time variation, which trades effectiveness for complexity of computation.",
                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to <br>whitewash</br> and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",
                "The peer could be making a strategic decision or someone may have hijacked her identity (e.g., by compromising her host).",

                "In particular, we use a <br>prisoners dilemma</br> model to capture the essential tension between individual and social utility, asymmetric payoff matrices to allow asymmetric transactions between peers, and a learning-based [14] population dynamic model to specify the behavior of individual peers, which can be changed continuously.",
                "While social dilemmas have been studied extensively, P2P applications impose a unique set of challenges, including: • Large populations and high turnover: A file sharing system such as Gnutella and KaZaa can exceed 100, 000 simultaneous users, and nodes can have an average life-time of the order of minutes [33]. • Asymmetry of interest: Asymmetric transactions of P2P systems create the possibility for asymmetry of interest.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, A wants service from B, B wants service from C, and C wants service from A. • Zero-cost identity: Many P2P systems allow peers to continuously switch identities (i.e., whitewash).",

                "However, the large populations and high turnover of P2P systems makes it less likely that repeat interactions will occur with a familiar entity.",
                "We show that by having each peer keep a 102 private history of the actions of other peers toward her, and using discriminating server selection, the Reciprocative decision function can scale to large populations and moderate levels of turnover. • Shared History: Scaling to higher turnover and mitigating asymmetry of interest requires shared history.",

                "If everyone provides service, then the system operates optimally.",

                "This results in a higher level of cooperation than with private history.",
                "The cost of shared history is a distributed infrastructure (e.g., distributed hash table-based storage) to store the history. • Maxflow-based Subjective Reputation: Shared history creates the possibility for collusion.",
                "In the example in Figure 1, C can falsely claim that A served him, thus deceiving B into providing service.",
                "We show that a maxflow-based algorithm that computes reputation subjectively promotes cooperation despite collusion among 1/3 of the population.",

                "We show that the maxflow-based algorithm scales better than private history in the presence of colluders without the centralized trust required in previous work [9] [20]. • Adaptive Stranger Policy: Zero-cost identities allows noncooperating peers to escape the consequences of not cooperating and eventually destroy cooperation in the system if not stopped.",
                "We show that if Reciprocative peers treat strangers (peers with no history) using a policy that adapts to the behavior of previous strangers, peers have little incentive to whitewash and whitewashing can be nearly eliminated from the system.",
                "The adaptive stranger policy does this without requiring centralized allocation of identities, an entry fee for newcomers, or rate-limiting [13] [9] [25]. • Short-term History: History also creates the possibility that a previously well-behaved peer with a good reputation will turn traitor and use his good reputation to exploit other peers.",
