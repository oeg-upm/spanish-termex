INTRODUCTION In this paper, we introduce and examine a natural extension of classical evolutionary game theory (EGT) to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network. This extension generalizes the classical setting, in which all pairs of organisms in an infinite population are equally likely to interact. The classical setting can be viewed as the special case in which the underlying network is a clique. There are many obvious reasons why one would like to examine more general graphs, the primary one being in that many scenarios considered in evolutionary game theory, all interactions are in fact not possible. For example, geographical restrictions may limit interactions to physically proximate pairs of organisms. More generally, as evolutionary game theory has become a plausible model not only for biological interaction, but also economic and other kinds of interaction in which certain dynamics are more imitative than optimizing (see [2, 16] and chapter 4 of [19]), the network constraints may come from similarly more general sources. Evolutionary game theory on networks has been considered before, but not in the generality we will do so here (see Section 4). We generalize the definition of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) to networks, and show a pair of complementary results that exhibit the power of randomization in our setting: subject to degree or edge density conditions, the classical ESS of any game are preserved when the graph is chosen randomly and the mutation set is chosen adversarially, or when the graph is chosen adversarially and the mutation set is chosen randomly. We examine natural strengthenings of our generalized ESS definition, and show that similarly strong results are not possible for them. The work described here is part of recent efforts examining the relationship between graph topology or structure and properties of equilibrium outcomes. Previous works in this line include studies of the relationship of topology to properties of correlated equilibria in graphical games [11], and studies of price variation in graph-theoretic market exchange models [12]. More generally, this work contributes to the line of graph-theoretic models for game theory investigated in both computer science [13] and economics [10]. 2. CLASSICAL EGT The fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the population [17]. To make this more precise, we describe the basic model of evolutionary game theory, in which the notion of an ESS resides. The standard model of evolutionary game theory considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game. The game is defined by a fitness function F. All pairs of members of the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one another. If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s 200 and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s). In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 − fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants. Assume two organisms are chosen uniformly at random to play each other. The strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t, for all t = s and all sufficiently small . Since an incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability 1 − and it will meet a mutant with probability , we can calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent, which is simply (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t). Similarly, the expected fitness of a mutant is (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). Thus we come to the formal definition of an ESS [19]. Definition 2.1. A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the 2-player, symmetric game given by fitness function F, if for every strategy t = s, there exists an t such that for all 0 < < t, (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS, it must be the case that F(s|s) ≥ F(t|s), for all strategies t. This inequality means that s must be a best response to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash equilibrium. In general the notion of ESS is more restrictive than Nash equilibrium, and not all 2-player, symmetric games have an ESS. In this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of network structure preserve the ESS strategies for those games that do have a standard ESS. First we must of course generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting. 3. EGT ON GRAPHS In our setting, we will no longer assume that two organisms are chosen uniformly at random to interact. Instead, we assume that organisms interact only with those in their local neighborhood, as defined by an undirected graph or network. As in the classical setting (which can be viewed as the special case of the complete network or clique), we shall assume an infinite population, by which we mean we examine limiting behavior in a family of graphs of increasing size. Before giving formal definitions, some comments are in order on what to expect in moving from the classical to the graph-theoretic setting. In the classical (complete graph) setting, there exist many symmetries that may be broken in moving to the the network setting, at both the group and individual level. Indeed, such asymmetries are the primary interest in examining a graph-theoretic generalization. For example, at the group level, in the standard ESS definition, one need not discuss any particular set of mutants of population fraction . Since all organisms are equally likely to interact, the survival or fate of any specific mutant set is identical to that of any other. In the network setting, this may not be true: some mutant sets may be better able to survive than others due to the specific topologies of their interactions in the network. For instance, foreshadowing some of our analysis, if s is an ESS but F(t|t) is much larger than F(s|s) and F(s|t), a mutant set with a great deal of internal interaction (that is, edges between mutants) may be able to survive, whereas one without this may suffer. At the level of individuals, in the classical setting, the assertion that one mutant dies implies that all mutants die, again by symmetry. In the network setting, individual fates may differ within a group all playing a common strategy. These observations imply that in examining ESS on networks we face definitional choices that were obscured in the classical model. If G is a graph representing the allowed pairwise interactions between organisms (vertices), and u is a vertex of G playing strategy su, then the fitness of u is given by F(u) = P v∈Γ(u) F(su|sv) |Γ(u)| . Here sv is the strategy being played by the neighbor v, and Γ(u) = {v ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E}. One can view the fitness of u as the average fitness u would obtain if it played each if its neighbors, or the expected fitness u would obtain if it were assigned to play one of its neighbors chosen uniformly at random. Classical evolutionary game theory examines an infinite, symmetric population. Graphs or networks are inherently finite objects, and we are specifically interested in their asymmetries, as discussed above. Thus all of our definitions shall revolve around an infinite family G = {Gn}∞ n=0 of finite graphs Gn over n vertices, but we shall examine asymptotic (large n) properties of such families. We first give a definition for a family of mutant vertex sets in such an infinite graph family to contract. Definition 3.1. Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices. Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of subsets of vertices of the Gn such that |Mn| ≥ n for some constant > 0. Suppose all the vertices of Mn play a common (mutant) strategy t, and suppose the remaining vertices in Gn play a common (incumbent) strategy s. We say that Mn contracts if for sufficiently large n, for all but o(n) of the j ∈ Mn, j has an incumbent neighbor i such that F(j) < F(i). A reasonable alternative would be to ask that the condition above hold for all mutants rather than all but o(n). Note also that we only require that a mutant have one incumbent neighbor of higher fitness in order to die; one might considering requiring more. In Sections 6.1 and 6.2 we consider these stronger conditions and demonstrate that our results can no longer hold. In order to properly define an ESS for an infinite family of finite graphs in a way that recovers the classical definition asymptotically in the case of the family of complete graphs, we first must give a definition that restricts attention to families of mutant vertices that are smaller than some invasion threshold n, yet remain some constant fraction of the population. This prevents invasions that survive merely by constituting a vanishing fraction of the population. Definition 3.2. Let > 0, and let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices. Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of (mutant) vertices in Gn. We say that M is -linear if there exists an , > > 0, such that for all sufficiently large n, n > |Mn| > n. We can now give our definition for a strategy to be evolutionarily stable when employed by organisms interacting with their neighborhood in a graph. 201 Definition 3.3. Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices. Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game for which s is a strategy. We say that s is an ESS with respect to F and G if for all mutant strategies t = s, there exists an t > 0 such that for any t-linear family of mutant vertices M = {Mn}∞ n=0 all playing t, for n sufficiently large, Mn contracts. Thus, to violate the ESS property for G, one must witness a family of mutations M in which each Mn is an arbitrarily small but nonzero constant fraction of the population of Gn, but does not contract (i.e. every mutant set has a subset of linear size that survives all of its incumbent interactions). In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in the case where G is the family of complete graphs, in the limit of large n. We note that even in the classical model, small sets of mutants were allowed to have greater fitness than the incumbents, as long as the size of the set was o(n) [18]. In the definition above there are three parameters: the game F, the graph family G and the mutation family M. Our main results will hold for any 2-player, symmetric game F. We will also study two rather general settings for G and M: that in which G is a family of random graphs and M is arbitrary, and that in which G is nearly arbitrary and M is randomly chosen. In both cases, we will see that, subject to conditions on degree or edge density (essentially forcing connectivity of G but not much more), for any 2-player, symmetric game, the ESS of the classical settings, and only those strategies, are always preserved. Thus a common theme of these results is the power of randomization: as long as either the network itself is chosen randomly, or the mutation set is chosen randomly, classical ESS are preserved. 4. RELATED WORK There has been previous work that analyzes which strategies are resilient to mutant invasions with respect to various types of graphs. What sets our work apart is that the model we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of games and graph topologies. We will briefly survey this literature and point out the differences in the previous models and ours. In [8], [3], and [4], the authors consider specific families of graphs, such as cycles and lattices, where players play specific games, such as 2 × 2-games or k × k-coordination games. In these papers the authors specify a simple, local dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing strategies, and analyze what type of strategies will grow to dominate the population. The model we propose is more general than both of these, as it encompasses a larger class of graphs as well as a richer set of games. Also related to our work is that of [14], where the authors propose two models. The first assumes organisms interact according to a weighted, undirected graph. However, the fitness of each organism is simply assigned and does not depend on the actions of each organisms neighborhood. The second model has organisms arranged around a directed cycle, where neighbors play a 2 × 2-game. With probability proportional to its fitness, an organism is chosen to reproduce by placing a replica of itself in its neighbors position, thereby killing the neighbor. We consider more general games than the first model and more general graphs than the second. Finally, the works most closely related to ours are [7], [15], and [6]. The authors consider 2-action, coordination games played by players in a general undirected graph. In these three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a strategy to overrun the population. Here again, one can see that our model is more general than these, as it allows for organisms to play any 2-player, symmetric game. 5. NETWORKS PRESERVING ESS We now proceed to state and prove two complementary results in the network ESS model defined in Section 3. First, we consider a setting where the graphs are generated via the Gn,p model of Erd˝os and R´enyi [5]. In this model, every pair of vertices are joined by an edge independently and with probability p (where p may depend on n). The mutant set, however, will be constructed adversarially (subject to the linear size constraint given by Definition 3.3). For these settings, we show that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS of that game, if and only if s is an ESS for {Gn,p}∞ n=0, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1, and any mutant family {Mn}∞ n=0, where each Mn has linear size. We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ). It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games. Thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge density. The second result is a kind of dual to the first, considering a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily (subject to conditions) but the mutant sets are chosen randomly. It states that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS for that game, if and only if s is an ESS for any {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0), and a family of mutant sets {Mn}∞ n=0, that is chosen randomly (that is, in which each organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability > 0). Thus, in this setting we again find that classical ESS are preserved subject to edge density restrictions. Since the degree assumption is somewhat strong, we also prove another result which only assumes that |En| ≥ n1+γ , and shows that there must exist at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness (as opposed to showing that all but o(n) mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness). As will be discussed, this rules out stationary mutant invasions. 5.1 Random Graphs, Adversarial Mutations Now we state and prove a theorem which shows that if s is a classical ESS, then s will be an ESS for random graphs, where a linear sized set of mutants is chosen by an adversary. Theorem 5.1. Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game, and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let the infinite graph family {Gn}∞ n=0 be drawn according to Gn,p, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1. Then with probability 1, s is an ESS. The main idea of the proof is to divide mutants into 2 categories, those with normal fitness and those with ab202 normal fitness. First, we show all but o(n) of the population (incumbent or mutant) have an incumbent neighbor of normal fitness. This will imply that all but o(n) of the mutants of normal fitness have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness. The vehicle for proving this is Theorem 2.15 of [5], which gives an upper bound on the number of vertices not connected to a sufficiently large set. This theorem assumes that the size of this large set is known with equality, which necessitates the union bound argument below. Secondly, we show that there can be at most o(n) mutants with abnormal fitness. Since there are so few of them, even if none of them have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness, s will still be an ESS with respect to F and G. Proof. (Sketch) Let t = s be the mutant strategy. Since s is a classical ESS, there exists an t such that (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t), for all 0 < < t. Let M be any mutant family that is t-linear. Thus for any fixed value of n that is sufficiently large, there exists an such that |Mn| = n and t > > 0. Also, let In = Vn \\ Mn and let I ⊆ In be the set of incumbents that have fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)] for some constant τ, 0 < τ < 1/6. Lemma 5.1 below shows (1 − )n ≥ |I | ≥ (1 − )n − 24 log n τ2p . Finally, let TI = {x ∈ V \\ I : Γ(x) ∩ I = ∅}. (For the sake of clarity we suppress the subscript n on the sets I and T.) The union bound gives us Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤ (1− )n X i=(1− )n− 24 log n τ2p Pr(|TI | ≥ δn and |I | = i) (1) Letting δ = n−γ for some γ > 0 gives δn = o(n). We will apply Theorem 2.15 of [5] to the summand on the right hand side of Equation 1. If we let γ = (1−c)/2, and combine this with the fact that 0 ≤ c < 1, all of the requirements of this theorem will be satisfied (details omitted). Now when we apply this theorem to Equation 1, we get Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤ (1− )n X i=(1− )n− 24 log n τ2p exp „ − 1 6 Cδn « (2) = o(1) This is because equation 2 has only 24 log n τ2p terms, and Theorem 2.15 of [5] gives us that C ≥ (1 − )n1−c − 24 log n τ2 . Thus we have shown, with probability tending to 1 as n → ∞, at most o(n) individuals are not attached to an incumbent which has fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)]. This implies that the number of mutants of approximately normal fitness, not attached to an incumbent of approximately normal fitness, is also o(n). Now those mutants of approximately normal fitness that are attached to an incumbent of approximately normal fitness have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t)]. The incumbents that they are attached to have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)]. Since s is an ESS of F, we know (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t), thus if we choose τ small enough, we can ensure that all but o(n) mutants of normal fitness have a neighboring incumbent of higher fitness. Finally by Lemma 5.1, we know there are at most o(n) mutants of abnormal fitness. So even if all of them are more fit than their respective incumbent neighbors, we have shown all but o(n) of the mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness. We now state and prove the lemma used in the proof above. Lemma 5.1. For almost every graph Gn,p with (1 − )n incumbents, all but 24 log n δ2p incumbents have fitness in the range (1±δ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], where p = Ω(1/nc ) and , δ and c are constants satisfying 0 < < 1, 0 < δ < 1/6, 0 ≤ c < 1. Similarly, under the same assumptions, all but 24 log n δ2p mutants have fitness in the range (1 ± δ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)]. Proof. We define the mutant degree of a vertex to be the number of mutant neighbors of that vertex, and incumbent degree analogously. Observe that the only way for an incumbent to have fitness far from its expected value of (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) is if it has a fraction of mutant neighbors either much higher or much lower than . Theorem 2.14 of [5] gives us a bound on the number of such incumbents. It states that the number of incumbents with mutant degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|M| is at most 12 log n δ2p . By the same theorem, the number of incumbents with incumbent degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|I| is at most 12 log n δ2p . From the linearity of fitness as a function of the fraction of mutant or incumbent neighbors, one can show that for those incumbents with mutant and incumbent degree in the expected range, their fitness is within a constant factor of (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), where that constant goes to 1 as n tends to infinity and δ tends to 0. The proof for the mutant case is analogous. We note that if in the statement of Theorem 5.1 we let c = 0, then p = 1. This, in turn, makes G = {Kn}∞ n=0, where Kn is a clique of n vertices. Then for any Kn all of the incumbents will have identical fitness and all of the mutants will have identical fitness. Furthermore, since s was an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness will be higher than the mutant fitness. Finally, one can show that as n → ∞, the incumbent fitness converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and the mutant fitness converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). In other words, s must be a classical ESS, providing a converse to Theorem 5.1. We rigorously present this argument in Section A.1. 5.2 Adversarial Graphs, Random Mutations We now move on to our second main result. Here we show that if the graph family, rather than being chosen randomly, is arbitrary subject to a minimum degree requirement, and the mutation sets are randomly chosen, classical ESS are again preserved. A modified notion of ESS allows us to considerably weaken the degree requirement to a minimum edge density requirement. Theorem 5.2. Let G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0). Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game, and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let t be any mutant strategy, and let the mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be chosen randomly by labeling each vertex a mutant with constant probability , where t > > 0. Then with probability 1, s is an ESS with respect to F, G and M. 203 Proof. Let t = s be the mutant strategy and let X be the event that every incumbent has fitness within the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)], for some constant τ > 0 to be specified later. Similarly, let Y be the event that every mutant has fitness within the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)]. Since Pr(X ∩ Y ) = 1 − Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ), we proceed by showing Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) = o(1). ¬X is the event that there exists an incumbent with fitness outside the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)]. If degM (v) denotes the number of mutant neighbors of v, similarly, degI (v) denotes the number of incumbent neighbors of v, then an incumbent i has fitness degI (i) deg(i) F(s|s)+ degM (i) deg(i) F(s|t). Since F(s|s) and F(s|t) are fixed quantities, the only variation in an incumbents fitness can come from variation in the terms degI (i) deg(i) and degM (i) deg(i) . One can use the Chernoff bound followed by the union bound to show that for any incumbent i, Pr(F(i) /∈ (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)]) < 4 exp „ − deg(i)τ2 3 « . Next one can use the union bound again to bound the probability of the event ¬X, Pr(¬X) ≤ 4n exp „ − diτ2 3 « where di = mini∈V \\M deg(i), 0 < ≤ 1/2. An analogous argument can be made to show Pr(¬Y ) < 4n exp(− dj τ2 3 ), where dj = minj∈M deg(j) and 0 < ≤ 1/2. Thus, by the union bound, Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) < 8n exp „ − dτ2 3 « where d = minv∈V deg(v), 0 < ≤ 1/2. Since deg(v) = Ω(nγ ), for all v ∈ V , and , τ and γ are all constants greater than 0, lim n→∞ 8n exp ( dτ2/3) = 0, so Pr(¬X∪¬Y ) = o(1). Thus, we can choose τ small enough such that (1 + τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)] < (1 − τ)[(1 − )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], and then choose n large enough such that with probability 1 − o(1), every incumbent will have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+F(s|t)], and every mutant will have fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)]. So with high probability, every incumbent will have a higher fitness than every mutant. By arguments similar to those following the proof of Theorem 5.1, if we let G = {Kn}∞ n=0, each incumbent will have the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness. Furthermore, since s is an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness must be higher than the mutant fitness. Here again, one has to show show that as n → ∞, the incumbent fitness converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and the mutant fitness converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t). Observe that the exact fraction mutants of Vn is now a random variable. So to prove this convergence we use an argument similar to one that is used to prove that sequence of random variables that converges in probability also converges in distribution (details omitted). This in turn establishes that s must be a classical ESS, and we thus obtain a converse to Theorem 5.2. This argument is made rigorous in Section A.2. The assumption on the degree of each vertex of Theorem 5.2 is rather strong. The following theorem relaxes this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have n1+γ edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness. A strategy that is an ESS in this weakened sense will essentially rule out stable, static sets of mutant invasions, but not more complex invasions. An example of more complex invasions are mutant sets that survive, but only by perpetually migrating through the graph under some natural evolutionary dynamics, akin to gliders in the well-known Game of Life [1]. Theorem 5.3. Let F be any game, and let s be a classical ESS of F, and let t = s be a mutant strategy. For any graph family G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which |En| ≥ n1+γ (for any constant γ > 0), and any mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0 which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability , where t > > 0, the probability that there exists a mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness approaches 1 as n → ∞. Proof. (Sketch) The main idea behind the proof is to show that with high probability, over only the choice of mutants, there will be an incumbent-mutant edge in which both vertices have high degree. If their degree is high enough, we can show that close to an fraction of their neighbors are mutants, and thus their fitnesses are very close to what we expect them to be in the classical case. Since s is an ESS, the fitness of the incumbent will be higher than the mutant. We call an edge (i, j) ∈ En a g(n)-barbell if deg(i) ≥ g(n) and deg(j) ≥ g(n). Suppose Gn has at most h(n) edges that are g(n)-barbells. This means there are at least |En| − h(n) edges in which at least one vertex has degree at most g(n). We call these vertices light vertices. Let (n) be the number of light vertices in Gn. Observe that |En|−h(n) ≤ (n)g(n). This is because each light vertex is incident on at most g(n) edges. This gives us that |En| ≤ h(n) + (n)g(n) ≤ h(n) + ng(n). So if we choose h(n) and g(n) such that h(n) + ng(n) = o(n1+γ ), then |En| = o(n1+γ ). This contradicts the assumption that |En| = Ω(n1+γ ). Thus, subject to the above constraint on h(n) and g(n), Gn must contain at least h(n) edges that are g(n)-barbells. Now let Hn denote the subgraph induced by the barbell edges of Gn. Note that regardless of the structure of Gn, there is no reason that Hn should be connected. Thus, let m be the number of connected components of Hn, and let c1, c2, . . . , cm be the number of vertices in each of these connected components. Note that since Hn is an edge-induced subgraph we have ck ≥ 2 for all components k. Let us choose the mutant set by first flipping the vertices in Hn only. We now show that the probability, with respect to the random mutant set, that none of the components of Hn have an incumbent-mutant edge is exponentially small in n. Let An be the event that every component of Hn contains only mutants or only incumbents. Then algebraic manipulations can establish that Pr[An] = Πm k=1( ck + (1 − )ck ) ≤ (1 − )(1− β2 2 ) Pm k=1 ck 204 where β is a constant. Thus for sufficiently small the bound decreases exponentially with Pm k=1 ck. Furthermore, sincePm k=1 `ck 2 ´ ≥ h(n) (with equality achieved by making each component a clique), one can show that Pm k=1 ck ≥ p h(n). Thus, as long as h(n) → ∞ with n, the probability that all components are uniformly labeled will go to 0. Now assuming that there exists a non-uniformly labeled component, by construction that component contains an edge (i, j) where i is an incumbent and j is a mutant, that is a g(n)-barbell. We also assume that the h(n) vertices already labeled have been done so arbitrarily, but that the remaining g(n) − h(n) vertices neighboring i and j are labeled mutants independently with probability . Then via a standard Chernoff bound argument, one can show that with high probability, the fraction of mutants neighboring i and the fraction of mutants neighboring j is in the range (1 ± τ)(g(n)−h(n)) g(n) . Similarly, one can show that the fraction of incumbents neighboring i and the fraction of mutants neighboring j is in the range 1 − (1 ± τ)(g(n)−h(n)) g(n) . Since s is an ESS, there exists a ζ > 0 such that (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t) = (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t) + ζ. If we choose g(n) = nγ , and h(n) = o(g(n)), we can choose n large enough and τ small enough to force F(i) > F(j), as desired. 6. LIMITATIONS OF STRONGER MODELS In this section we show that if one tried to strengthen the model described in Section 3 in two natural ways, one would not be able to prove results as strong as Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game. 6.1 Stronger Contraction for the Mutant Set In Section 3 we alluded to the fact that we made certain design decisions in arriving at Definitions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. One such decision was to require that all but o(n) mutants have incumbent neighbors of higher fitness. Instead, we could have required that all mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness. The two theorems in this subsection show that if one were to strengthen our notion of contraction for the mutant set, given by Definition 3.1, in this way, it would be impossible to prove theorems analogous to Theorems 5.1 and 5.3. Recall that Definition 3.1 gave the notion of contraction for a linear sized subset of mutants. In what follows, we will say an edge (i, j) contracts if i is an incumbent, j is a mutant, and F(i) > F(j). Also, recall that Theorem 5.1 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then it is an ESS for random graphs with adversarial mutations. Next, we prove that if we instead required every incumbent-mutant edge to contract, this need not be the case. Theorem 6.1. Let F be a 2-player, symmetric game that has a classical ESS s for which there exists a mutant strategy t = s with F(t|t) > F(s|s) and F(t|t) > F(s|t). Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of random graphs drawn according to Gn,p, where p = Ω(1/nc ) for any constant 0 ≤ c < 1. Then with probability approaching 1 as n → ∞, there exists a mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0, where tn > |Mn| > n and t, > 0, in which there is an edge that does not contract. Proof. (Sketch) With probability approaching 1 as n → ∞, there exists a vertex j where deg(j) is arbitrarily close to n. So label j mutant, label one of its neighbors incumbent, denoted i, and label the rest of js neighborhood mutant. Also, label all of is neighbors incumbent, with the exception of j and js neighbors (which were already labeled mutant). In this setting, one can show that F(j) will be arbitrarily close to F(t|t) and F(i) will be a convex combination of F(s|s) and F(s|t), which are both strictly less than F(t|t). Theorem 5.3 stated that if s is a classical ESS, then for graphs where |En| ≥ n1+γ , for some γ > 0, and where each organism is labeled a mutant with probability , one edge must contract. Below we show that, for certain graphs and certain games, there will always exist one edge that will not contract. Theorem 6.2. Let F be a 2-player, symmetric game that has a classical ESS s, such that there exists a mutant strategy t = s where F(t|s) > F(s|t). There exists an infinite family of graphs {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0, where |En| = Θ(n2 ), such that for a mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0, which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability > 0, the probability there exists an edge in En that does not contract approaches 1 as n → ∞. Proof. (Sketch) Construct Gn as follows. Pick n/4 vertices u1, u2, . . . , un/4 and add edges such that they from a clique. Then, for each ui, i ∈ [n/4] add edges (ui, vi), (vi, wi) and (wi, xi). With probability 1 as n → ∞, there exists an i such that ui and wi are mutants and vi and xi are incumbents. Observe that F(vi) = F(xi) = F(s|t) and F(wi) = F(t|s). 6.2 Stronger Contraction for Individuals The model of Section 3 requires that for an edge (i, j) to contract, the fitness of i must be greater than the fitness of j. One way to strengthen this notion of contraction would be to require that the maximum fitness incumbent in the neighborhood of j be more fit than the maximum fitness mutant in the neighborhood of j. This models the idea that each organism is trying to take over each place in its neighborhood, but only the most fit organism in the neighborhood of a vertex gets the privilege of taking it. If we assume that we adopt this notion of contraction for individual mutants, and require that all incumbent-mutant edges contract, we will next show that Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 still hold, and thus it is still impossible to get results such as Theorems 5.1 and 5.3 which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game. In the proof of Theorem 6.1 we proved that F(i) is strictly less than F(j). Observe that maximum fitness mutant in the neighborhood of j must have fitness at least F(j). Also observe that there is only 1 incumbent in the neighborhood of j, namely i. So under this stronger notion of contraction, the edge (i, j) will not contract. Similarly, in the proof of Theorem 6.2, observe that the only mutant in the neighborhood of wi is wi itself, which has fitness F(t|s). Furthermore, the only incumbents in the neighborhood of wi are vi and xi, both of which have fitness F(s|t). By assumption, F(t|s) > F(s|t), thus, under this stronger notion of contraction, neither of the incumbentmutant edges, (vi, wi) and (xi, wi), will contract. 7. REFERENCES [1] Elwyn R.

GRAPHICAL AND CLASSICAL ESS In this section we explore the conditions under which a graphical ESS is also a classical ESS. To do so, we state and prove two theorems which provide converses to each of the major theorems in Section 3. A.1 Random Graphs, Adversarial Mutations Theorem 5.2 states that if s is a classical ESS and G = {Gn,p}, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1, then with probability 1 as n → ∞, s is an ESS with respect to G. Here we show that if s is an ESS with respect to G, then s is a classical ESS. In order to prove this theorem, we do not need the full generality of s being an ESS for G when p = Ω(1/nc ) where 0 ≤ c < 1. All we need is s to be an ESS for G when p = 1. In this case there are no more probabilistic events in the theorem statement. Also, since p = 1 each graph in G is a clique, so if one incumbent has a higher fitness than one mutant, then all incumbents have higher fitness than all mutants. This gives rise to the following theorem. Theorem A.1. Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game, and suppose s is a strategy for F and t = s is a mutant strategy. Let G = {Kn}∞ n=0. If, as n → ∞, for any t-linear family of mutants M = {Mn}∞ n=0, there exists an incumbent i and a mutant j such that F(i) > F(j), then s is a classical ESS of F. The proof of this theorem analyzes the limiting behavior of the mutant population as the size of the cliques in G tends to infinity. It also shows how the definition of ESS given in Section 5 recovers the classical definition of ESS. Proof. Since each graph in G is a clique, every incumbent will have the same number of incumbent and mutant neighbors, and every mutant will have the same number of incumbent and mutant neighbors. Thus, all incumbents will have identical fitness and all mutants will have identical fitness. Next, one can construct an t-linear mutant family M, where the fraction of mutants converges to for any , where t > > 0. So for n large enough, the number of mutants in Kn will be arbitrarily close to n. Thus, any mutant subset of size n will result in all incumbents having fitness (1 − n n−1 )F(s|s) + n n−1 F(s|t), and all mutants having fitness (1 − n−1 n−1 )F(t|s) + n−1 n−1 F(t|t). Furthermore, by assumption the incumbent fitness must be higher than the mutant fitness. This implies, lim n→∞ „ (1 − n n − 1 )F(s|s) + n n − 1 F(s|t) > (1 − n − 1 n − 1 )F(t|s) + n − 1 n − 1 F(t|t) « = 1. This implies, (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t), for all , where t > > 0. A.2 Adversarial Graphs, Random Mutations Theorem 5.2 states that if s is a classical ESS for a 2player, symmetric game F, where G is chosen adversarially subject to the constraint that the degree of each vertex is Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0), and mutants are chosen with probability , then s is an ESS with respect to F, G, and M. Here we show that if s is an ESS with respect to F, G, and M then s is a classical ESS. All we will need to prove this is that s is an ESS with respect to G = {Kn}∞ n=0, that is when each vertex has degree n − 1. As in Theorem A.1, since the graphs are cliques, if one incumbent has higher fitness than one mutant, then all incumbents have higher fitness than all mutants. Thus, the theorem below is also a converse to Theorem 5.3. (Recall that Theorem 5.3 uses a weaker notion of contraction that 206 requires only one incumbent to have higher fitness than one mutant.) Theorem A.2. Let F be any 2-player symmetric game, and suppose s is an incumbent strategy for F and t = s is a mutant strategy. Let G = {Kn}∞ n=0. If with probability 1 as n → ∞, s is an ESS for G and a mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0, which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability , where t > > 0, then s is a classical ESS of F. This proof also analyzes the limiting behavior of the mutant population as the size of the cliques in G tends to infinity. Since the mutants are chosen randomly we will use an argument similar to the proof that a sequence of random variables that converges in probability, also converge in distribution. In this case the sequence of random variables will be actual fraction of mutants in each Kn. Proof. Fix any value of , where n > > 0, and construct each Mn by labeling a vertex a mutant with probability . By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem A.1, if the actual number of mutants in Kn is denoted by nn, any mutant subset of size nn will result in all incumbents having fitness (1 − nn n−1 )F(s|s) + nn n−1 F(s|t), and in all mutants having fitness (1 − nn−1 n−1 )F(t|s) + nn−1 n−1 F(t|t). This implies lim n→∞ Pr(s is an ESS for Gn w.r.t. nn mutants) = 1 ⇒ lim n→∞ Pr „ (1 − nn n − 1 )F(s|s) + nn n − 1 F(s|t) > (1 − nn − 1 n − 1 )F(t|s) + nn − 1 n − 1 F(t|t) « = 1 ⇔ lim n→∞ Pr „ n > F(t|s) − F(s|s) F(s|t) − F(s|s) − F(t|t) + F(t|s) + F(s|s) − F(t|t) n « = 1 (3) By two simple applications of the Chernoff bound and an application of the union bound, one can show the sequence of random variables { n}∞ n=0 converges to in probability. Next, if we let Xn = − n, X = − , b = −F(s|s) + F(t|t), and a = − F (t|s)−F (s|s) F (s|t)−F (s|s)−F (t|t)+F (t|s) , by Theorem A.3 below, we get that limn→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) = Pr(X < a). Combining this with equation 3, Pr( > −a) = 1. The proof of the following theorem is very similar to the proof that a sequence of random variables that converges in probability, also converge in distribution. A good explanation of this can be found in [9], which is the basis for the argument below. Theorem A.3. If {Xn}∞ n=0 is a sequence of random variables that converge in probability to the random variable X, and a and b are constants, then limn→∞ Pr(Xn < a+b/n) = Pr(X < a). Proof. By Lemma A.1 (see below) we have the following two inequalities, Pr(X < a + b/n − τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ), Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + b/n + τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ). Combining these gives, Pr(X < a + b/n − τ) − Pr(|X − Xn| > τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + b/n + τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ). There exists an n0 such that for all n > n0, |b/n| < τ, so the following statement holds for all n > n0. Pr(X < a − 2τ) − Pr(|X − Xn| > τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + 2τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ). Take the limn→∞ of both sides of both inequalities, and since Xn converges in probability to X, Pr(X < a − 2τ) ≤ lim n→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) (4) ≤ Pr(X < a + 2τ). (5) Recall that X is a continuous random variable representing the fraction of mutants in an infinite sized graph. So if we let FX (a) = Pr(X < a), we see that FX (a) is a cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable, and is therefore continuous from the right. So lim τ↓0 FX (a − τ) = lim τ↓0 FX (a + τ) = FX (a). Thus if we take the limτ↓0 of inequalities 4 and 5 we get Pr(X < a) = lim n→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n). The following lemma is quite useful, as it expresses the cumulative distribution of one random variable Y , in terms of the cumulative distribution of another random variable X and the difference between X and Y . Lemma A.1. If X and Y are random variables, c ∈ and τ > 0, then Pr(Y < c) ≤ Pr(X < c + τ) + Pr(|Y − X| > τ). Proof. Pr(Y < c) = Pr(Y < c, X < c + τ) + Pr(Y < c, X ≥ c + τ) ≤ Pr(Y < c | X < c + τ) Pr(X < c + τ) + Pr(|Y − X| > τ) ≤ Pr(X < c + τ) + Pr(|Y − X| > τ) 207",

Introducción En este documento, presentamos y examinamos una extensión natural de la teoría de juegos evolutivos clásicos (EGT) a un entorno en el que las interacciones por pares están restringidas a los bordes de un gráfico o red no dirigida. Esta extensión generaliza el entorno clásico, en el que todos los pares de organismos en una población infinita tienen la misma probabilidad de interactuar. La configuración clásica se puede ver como el caso especial en el que la red subyacente es una camarilla. Hay muchas razones obvias por las cuales a uno le gustaría examinar gráficos más generales, el principal es que muchos escenarios considerados en la teoría evolutiva del juego, de hecho, todas las interacciones no son posibles. Por ejemplo, las restricciones geográficas pueden limitar las interacciones a pares de organismos restringidos físicamente. En general, como la teoría del juego evolutivo se ha convertido en un modelo plausible no solo para la interacción biológica, sino también de interacción económica y de otro tipo en la que ciertas dinámicas son más imitativas que optimizar (ver [2, 16] y el capítulo 4 de [19]), las restricciones de red pueden provenir de fuentes más generales. La teoría de juegos evolutivos en las redes se ha considerado antes, pero no en la generalidad lo haremos aquí (ver Sección 4). Generalizamos la definición de una estrategia estable evolutiva (ESS) a las redes, y mostramos un par de resultados complementarios que exhiben el poder de la aleatorización en nuestro entorno: sujeto a condiciones de densidad de grado o de borde, el ESS clásico de cualquier juego se conserva cuando elEl gráfico se elige al azar y el conjunto de mutaciones se elige adversarmente, o cuando el gráfico se elige adversarmente y el conjunto de mutaciones se elige al azar. Examinamos los fortalecimientos naturales de nuestra definición de ESS generalizada, y mostramos que no son posibles resultados igualmente fuertes para ellos. El trabajo descrito aquí es parte de los esfuerzos recientes que examinan la relación entre la topología o la estructura gráfica y las propiedades de los resultados de equilibrio. Los trabajos anteriores en esta línea incluyen estudios de la relación de la topología con las propiedades de los equilibrios correlacionados en los juegos gráficos [11], y los estudios de la variación de precios en los modelos de intercambio de mercado teórico gráfico [12]. En términos más generales, este trabajo contribuye a la línea de modelos teóricos gráficos para la teoría de juegos investigados tanto en la informática [13] como en la economía [10].2. EGT clásico El concepto fundamental de la teoría de los juegos evolutivos es la estrategia evolutivamente estable (ESS). Intuitivamente, un ESS es una estrategia tal que si todos los miembros de una población lo adoptan, entonces ninguna estrategia mutante podría invadir a la población [17]. Para hacer esto más preciso, describimos el modelo básico de la teoría de los juegos evolutivos, en el que reside la noción de un ESS. El modelo estándar de la teoría de juegos evolutivos considera una población infinita de organismos, cada uno de los cuales juega una estrategia en un juego simétrico fijo de 2 jugadores. El juego está definido por una función de aptitud física F. Todos los pares de miembros de la población infinita tienen la misma probabilidad de interactuar entre sí. Si dos organismos interactúan, una estrategia de juego S 200 y la otra estrategia de juego T, el jugador S gana una aptitud de F (S | T), mientras que el jugador T gana una aptitud de F (T | S). En esta población infinita de organismos, suponga que hay una fracción 1 que juega estrategias S y llama a estos organismos titulares;y supongamos que hay una fracción que juega T y llaman a estos organismos mutantes. Suponga que dos organismos se eligen uniformemente al azar para jugar entre sí. La estrategia s es un ESS si la aptitud esperada de un organismo que juega S es más alto que el de un organismo que juega T, para todos los t = s y todos lo suficientemente pequeños. Dado que un titular cumplirá con otro titular con la probabilidad 1, y se encontrará con un mutante con probabilidad, podemos calcular la aptitud esperada de un titular, que es simplemente (1 -) f (s | s) + f (s | t). Del mismo modo, la aptitud esperada de un mutante es (1 -) f (t | s) + f (t | t). Así llegamos a la definición formal de un ESS [19]. Definición 2.1. Una estrategia s es una estrategia evolutivamente estable (ESS) para el juego simétrico de 2 jugadores dado por la función de aptitud física F, si para cada estrategia t = s, existe una t tal que para todos 0 <<t, (1-)F (S | S) + F (S | T)> (1 -) F (T | S) + F (T | T). Una consecuencia de esta definición es que para que S sea un ESS, debe ser el caso de que F (S | s) ≥ F (t | s), para todas las estrategias t.Esta desigualdad significa que S debe ser una mejor respuesta para sí misma y, por lo tanto, cualquier estrategia de ESS también debe ser un equilibrio de Nash. En general, la noción de ESS es más restrictiva que el equilibrio Nash, y no todos los juegos simétricos de 2 jugadores tienen un ESS. En este documento, nuestro interés es examinar qué tipos de estructura de red preservan las estrategias ESS para aquellos juegos que tienen un ESS estándar. Primero, por supuesto, debemos generalizar la definición de ESS a una configuración de red.3. EGT en gráficos en nuestro entorno, ya no asumiremos que dos organismos se eligen uniformemente al azar para interactuar. En cambio, suponemos que los organismos interactúan solo con aquellos en su vecindario local, según lo definido por un gráfico o red no dirigido. Al igual que en el entorno clásico (que puede verse como el caso especial de la red o camarilla completa), asumiremos una población infinita, con la cual nos referimos a examinar el comportamiento limitante en una familia de gráficos de tamaño creciente. Antes de dar definiciones formales, algunos comentarios están en orden sobre qué esperar para pasar de la configuración clásica a la teórica gráfica. En la configuración clásica (gráfica completa), existen muchas simetrías que pueden romperse para moverse a la configuración de la red, tanto a nivel grupal como individual. De hecho, tales asimetrías son el interés principal en examinar una generalización teórica gráfica. Por ejemplo, a nivel de grupo, en la definición de ESS estándar, no es necesario discutir ningún conjunto particular de mutantes de la fracción de población. Dado que todos los organismos tienen la misma probabilidad de interactuar, la supervivencia o el destino de cualquier conjunto mutante específico es idéntico al de cualquier otro. En la configuración de la red, esto puede no ser cierto: algunos conjuntos mutantes pueden sobrevivir mejor que otros debido a las topologías específicas de sus interacciones en la red. Por ejemplo, presagiar parte de nuestro análisis, si S es un ESS pero F (T | T) es mucho más grande que F (S | S) y F (S | T), un conjunto mutante con una gran interacción interna (Es decir, los bordes entre mutantes) pueden sobrevivir, mientras que uno sin esto puede sufrir. En el nivel de individuos, en el entorno clásico, la afirmación de que un mutante muere implica que todos los mutantes mueren, nuevamente por simetría. En la configuración de la red, los destinos individuales pueden diferir dentro de un grupo que juega una estrategia común. Estas observaciones implican que al examinar ESS en redes enfrentamos opciones de definición oscurecidas en el modelo clásico. Si G es un gráfico que representa las interacciones por pares permitidas entre los organismos (vértices), y U es un vértice de la estrategia de juego G SU, entonces la aptitud de U viene dada por f (u) = P v∈γ (u) f (su| sv) | γ (u) |. Aquí SV es la estrategia jugando por el vecino V, y γ (u) = {v ∈ V: (u, v) ∈ E}. Uno puede ver la aptitud de U como la aptitud promedio que obtendría si jugaría cada uno si sus vecinos, o la aptitud esperada que obtendría si se asignara para interpretar a uno de sus vecinos elegidos de manera uniforme al azar. La teoría de juegos evolutivos clásicos examina una población simétrica infinita. Los gráficos o redes son objetos inherentemente finitos, y estamos específicamente interesados en sus asimetrías, como se discutió anteriormente. Por lo tanto, todas nuestras definiciones girarán en torno a una familia infinita G = {Gn} ∞ n = 0 de gráficos finitos Gn sobre n vértices, pero examinaremos las propiedades asintóticas (grandes n) de tales familias. Primero damos una definición para una familia de conjuntos de vértices mutantes en una familia gráfica tan infinita para contratar. Definición 3.1. Sea G = {Gn} ∞ n = 0 una familia infinita de gráficos, donde Gn tiene n vértices. Sea M = {Mn} ∞ n = 0 cualquier familia de subconjuntos de vértices del GN tal que | Mn |≥ N para alguna constante> 0. Supongamos que todos los vértices de MN juegan una estrategia T Común (mutante), y suponga que los vértices restantes en GN juegan una estrategia común (titular).Decimos que MN se contrae si es suficientemente grande, para todos menos o (n) de la j ∈ Mn, j tiene un vecino titular i tal que f (j) <f (i). Una alternativa razonable sería pedir que la condición anterior se mantenga para todos los mutantes en lugar de todos menos o (n). Tenga en cuenta también que solo requerimos que un mutante tenga un vecino titular de la aptitud superior para morir;Uno podría considerar requerir más. En las Secciones 6.1 y 6.2 consideramos estas condiciones más fuertes y demostramos que nuestros resultados ya no pueden mantenerse. Para definir adecuadamente un ESS de una familia infinita de gráficos finitos de una manera que recupere la definición clásica asintóticamente en el caso de la familia de gráficos completos, primero debemos dar una definición que restringe la atención a las familias de vértices mutantes que son más pequeños que son más pequeñosque algún umbral de invasión n, pero siguen siendo una fracción constante de la población. Esto evita las invasiones que sobreviven simplemente al constituir una fracción de la población. Definición 3.2. Sea> 0, y deje g = {gn} ∞ n = 0 una familia infinita de gráficos, donde Gn tiene n vértices. Sea M = {Mn} ∞ n = 0 cualquier familia de vértices (mutante) en Gn. Decimos que m es -lineal si existe un, >> 0, de modo que para todos los n, n> | mn |> n.Ahora podemos dar nuestra definición para que una estrategia sea evolutivamente estable cuando los organismos que interactúan con su vecindario en un gráfico.201 Definición 3.3. Sea G = {Gn} ∞ n = 0 una familia infinita de gráficos, donde Gn tiene n vértices. Sea F cualquier juego simétrico de 2 jugadores para el cual S es una estrategia. Decimos que S es un ESS con respecto a F y G Si para todas las estrategias mutantes t = s, existe un t> 0 tal que para cualquier familia t-lineal de vértices mutantes m = {mn} ∞ n = 0 todos jugandot, para n suficientemente grandes, contratos de MN. Por lo tanto, para violar la propiedad ESS para G, uno debe presenciar una familia de mutaciones m en la que cada MN es una fracción constante arbitrariamente pequeña pero distante de la población de GN, pero no se contrae (es decir, cada conjunto mutante tiene un subconjunto de lineal lineal.tamaño que sobrevive a todas sus interacciones titulares). En la Sección A.1 mostramos que la definición dada coincide con la clásica en el caso en que G es la familia de gráficos completos, en el límite de N GRANDE N.Observamos que incluso en el modelo clásico, se permitió que pequeños conjuntos de mutantes tengan una mayor aptitud que los titulares, siempre que el tamaño del conjunto fuera o (n) [18]. En la definición anterior hay tres parámetros: el Juego F, la familia Graph G y la Familia de Mutación M. Nuestros resultados principales se mantendrán para cualquier juego simétrico de 2 jugadores F. También estudiaremos dos configuraciones más bien generales para G y M: Que G es una familia de gráficos aleatorios y M es arbitraria, y aquel en el que G es casi arbitraria y M se elige al azar. En ambos casos, veremos que, sujeto a condiciones de densidad de grado o de borde (esencialmente forzando la conectividad de G pero no mucho más), para cualquier juego simétrico de 2 jugadores, el ESS de la configuración clásica y solo esas estrategias,siempre se conservan. Por lo tanto, un tema común de estos resultados es el poder de la aleatorización: mientras la red en sí se elija al azar o el conjunto de mutaciones se elige al azar, se conserva el ESS clásico.4. Trabajo relacionado ha habido trabajos previos que analizan qué estrategias son resistentes a las invasiones mutantes con respecto a varios tipos de gráficos. Lo que distingue a nuestro trabajo es que el modelo que consideramos abarca una clase significativamente más general de juegos y topologías gráficas. Encontraremos brevemente esta literatura y señalaremos las diferencias en los modelos y los nuestros anteriores. En [8], [3] y [4], los autores consideran familias específicas de gráficos, como ciclos y redes, donde los jugadores juegan juegos específicos, como juegos de 2 × 2 o juegos de coordinación K × K. En estos documentos, los autores especifican una dinámica local simple para que los jugadores mejoren sus pagos cambiando las estrategias y analicen qué tipo de estrategias crecerán para dominar a la población. El modelo que proponemos es más general que ambos, ya que abarca una clase más grande de gráficos, así como un conjunto de juegos más rico. También relacionado con nuestro trabajo está el de [14], donde los autores proponen dos modelos. El primero supone que los organismos interactúan según un gráfico ponderado y no dirigido. Sin embargo, la aptitud de cada organismo simplemente se asigna y no depende de las acciones de cada vecindario de organismos. El segundo modelo tiene organismos organizados alrededor de un ciclo dirigido, donde los vecinos juegan un juego de 2 × 2. Con una probabilidad proporcional a su aptitud, se elige un organismo para reproducirse colocando una réplica de sí misma en su posición de vecinos, matando así al vecino. Consideramos juegos más generales que el primer modelo y más gráficos generales que el segundo. Finalmente, las obras más estrechamente relacionadas con las nuestras son [7], [15] y [6]. Los autores consideran juegos de coordinación 2-acción jugados por jugadores en un gráfico general no dirigido. En estos tres trabajos, los autores especifican una dinámica para una estrategia para reproducir y analizar las propiedades del gráfico que permiten una estrategia para invadir a la población. Aquí nuevamente, uno puede ver que nuestro modelo es más general que estos, ya que permite que los organismos jueguen cualquier juego simétrico de 2 jugadores.5. Las redes que preservan ESS ahora procedemos al estado y demostramos dos resultados complementarios en el modelo de red ESS definido en la Sección 3. Primero, consideramos una configuración donde se generan los gráficos a través del modelo GN, P de Erd˝os y R´enyi [5]. En este modelo, cada par de vértices se une por un borde de forma independiente y con probabilidad P (donde P puede depender de n). El conjunto mutante, sin embargo, se construirá adversarmente (sujeto a la restricción de tamaño lineal dada por la definición 3.3). Para estos ajustes, mostramos que para cualquier juego de 2 jugadores, S es un ESS clásico de ese juego, si y solo si S es un ESS para {Gn, P} ∞ n = 0, donde p = ω (1/nc) y 0 ≤ c <1, y cualquier familia mutante {mn} ∞ n = 0, donde cada mn tiene tamaño lineal. Observamos que en estos entornos, si dejamos C = 1 - γ para γ> 0 pequeños, el número esperado de bordes en GN es N1+γ o más grande, es decir, solo superlineal en el número de vértices y potencialmente más pequeño queEn 2 ). Es fácil convencerse de que una vez que los gráficos tienen solo un número lineal de bordes, estamos coqueteando con la desconexión, y simplemente puede haber grandes conjuntos mutantes que pueden sobrevivir de forma aislada debido a la falta de interacciones titulares en ciertos juegos. Por lo tanto, en cierto sentido examinamos la densidad mínima plausible de borde. El segundo resultado es un tipo de doble para el primero, considerando una configuración donde los gráficos se eligen arbitrariamente (sujeto a condiciones) pero los conjuntos mutantes se eligen al azar. Establece que para cualquier juego de 2 jugadores, S es un ESS clásico para ese juego, si y solo si S es un ESS para cualquier {Gn = (vn, en)} ∞ n = 0 para todos v ∈Vn, deg (v) = ω (nγ) (para cualquier constante γ> 0), y una familia de conjuntos mutantes {mn} ∞ n = 0, que se elige al azar (es decir, en la que cada organismo está marcado como un mutantecon probabilidad constante> 0). Por lo tanto, en este entorno, nuevamente encontramos que los ES clásicos se conservan sujetos a restricciones de densidad de borde. Dado que la suposición de grado es algo fuerte, también demostramos otro resultado que solo supone que | en |≥ N1+γ, y muestra que debe existir al menos 1 mutante con un vecino titular de la condición física superior (en lugar de demostrar que todos los mutantes, menos o (n) tienen un vecino titular de la aptitud superior). Como se discutirá, esto descarta invasiones mutantes estacionarias.5.1 Gráficos aleatorios, mutaciones adversas Ahora indicamos y demostramos un teorema que muestra que si S es un ESS clásico, entonces S será un ESS para gráficos aleatorios, donde un adversario elige un conjunto de mutantes de tamaño lineal. Teorema 5.1. Sea F cualquier juego de 2 jugadores, simétrico, y supongamos que S es un esencia clásica de F. Deje que la familia de gráficos infinitos se dibuje {Gn} ∞ n = 0 de acuerdo con Gn, P, donde p = ω (1/nc)y 0 ≤ c <1. Entonces, con la probabilidad 1, S es un ESS. La idea principal de la prueba es dividir mutantes en 2 categorías, aquellos con aptitud normal y aquellos con AB202 Fitness normal. Primero, mostramos que todos menos o (n) de la población (titular o mutante) tienen un vecino titular de la aptitud normal. Esto implicará que todos menos o (n) de los mutantes de la aptitud física normal tienen un vecino titular de la aptitud más alta. El vehículo para probar esto es el teorema 2.15 de [5], que da un límite superior en el número de vértices no conectados a un conjunto suficientemente grande. Este teorema supone que el tamaño de este gran conjunto se conoce con igualdad, lo que requiere el argumento de la Unión Bound a continuación. En segundo lugar, mostramos que puede haber como máximo mutantes O (n) con aptitud anormal. Dado que hay muy pocos de ellos, incluso si ninguno de ellos tiene un vecino titular de la condición física superior, S seguirá siendo un ESS con respecto a la prueba de F y G.(Sketch) Sea t = s la estrategia mutante. Dado que S es un ESS clásico, existe un T tal que (1−) F (S | S) + F (S | T)> (1 -) F (T | S) + F (T | T), paratodos 0 <<t.Sea una familia mutante que sea t-lineal. Por lo tanto, para cualquier valor fijo de N que sea suficientemente grande, existe un tal que | Mn |= n y t >> 0. Además, dejemos entrar = vn \\ mn y que sea el conjunto de titulares que tienen aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1 -) f (s | s) + f (s | t)] para algunosconstante τ, 0 <τ <1/6. Lema 5.1 a continuación muestra (1 -) n ≥ | i |≥ (1 -) n - 24 log n τ2p. Finalmente, deje que ti = {x ∈ V \\ I: γ (x) ∩ i = ∅}.(En aras de la claridad, suprimemos el subíndice n en los conjuntos I y T.) El límite de la unión nos da PR (| ti | ≥ Δn) ≤ (1-) n x i = (1-) n− 24 log n log nτ2p pr (| ti | ≥ Δn y | i | = i) (1) dejar Δ = n - γ para algunos γ> 0 da Δn = o (n). Aplicaremos el teorema 2.15 de [5] al sumandor en el lado derecho de la ecuación 1. Si dejamos γ = (1 - C)/2, y combinamos esto con el hecho de que 0 ≤ c <1, todos los requisitos de este teorema se cumplirán (los detalles omitidos). Ahora, cuando aplicamos este teorema a la Ecuación 1, obtenemos pr (| ti | ≥ Δn) ≤ (1-) n x i = (1-) n− 24 log n τ2p exp „ - 1 6 cΔn« (2) = =o (1) Esto se debe a que la ecuación 2 tiene solo 24 términos log n τ2p, y el teorema 2.15 de [5] nos da que c ≥ (1 -) n1 - c - 24 log n τ2. Por lo tanto, hemos demostrado, con probabilidad tendiendo a 1 como n → ∞, como máximo los individuos O (n) no están unidos a un titular que tiene aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1 -) f (s | s)+ F (s | t)]. Esto implica que el número de mutantes de aptitud física aproximadamente normal, no unida a un titular de aptitud física aproximadamente normal, también es O (N). Ahora, aquellos mutantes de aptitud física aproximadamente normal que están unidas a un titular de la aptitud aproximadamente normal tienen aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1−) F (t | S)+ F (t | t)]. Los titulares que están unidos para tener aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1−) F (S | S)+ F (S | T)]. Dado que S es un ess de F, sabemos (1-) F (S | S)+ F (S | T)> (1−) F (T | S)+ F (T | T), por lo tanto, si elegimosτ lo suficientemente pequeño, podemos asegurarnos de que todos los mutantes menos o (n) de la aptitud física normal tengan un titular vecino de mayor aptitud. Finalmente por Lemma 5.1, sabemos que hay como máximo o (n) mutantes de aptitud anormal. Entonces, incluso si todos ellos están más en forma que sus respectivos vecinos titulares, hemos demostrado que todos menos o (n) de los mutantes tienen un vecino titular de la aptitud más alta. Ahora declaramos y demostramos el lema utilizado en la prueba anterior. Lema 5.1. Para casi todos los gráficos GN, p con (1 -) n titulares, todos menos 24 titentes log n Δ2p tienen aptitud en el rango (1 ± δ) [(1−) F (S | S)+ F (S | T)], donde p = ω (1/nc) y, δ y c son constantes satisfactorias 0 <<1, 0 <Δ <1/6, 0 ≤ c <1. Del mismo modo, bajo los mismos supuestos, todos menos 24 mutantes log n Δ2p tienen aptitud en el rango (1 ± δ) [(1 -) F (t | s) + f (t | t)]. Prueba. Definimos que el grado mutante de un vértice sea el número de vecinos mutantes de ese vértice, y un grado titular análoga. Observe que la única forma de que un titular tenga una aptitud lejos de su valor esperado de (1-) F (S | S)+ F (S | T) es si tiene una fracción de vecinos mutantes mucho más altos o mucho más bajos que. Teorema 2.14 de [5] nos da un límite en el número de tales titulares. Establece que el número de titulares con grado mutante fuera del rango (1 ± Δ) P | M |es como máximo 12 log n Δ2p. Por el mismo teorema, el número de titulares con un grado titular fuera del rango (1 ± δ) P | I |es como máximo 12 log n Δ2p. Desde la linealidad de la aptitud en función de la fracción de vecinos mutantes o titulares, se puede demostrar que para aquellos titulares con un grado mutante y titular en el rango esperado, su aptitud está dentro de un factor constante de (1 -) F (S |s) + f (s | t), donde esa constante va a 1 ya que n tiende al infinito y δ tiende a 0. La prueba del caso mutante es análoga. Observamos que si en la declaración del teorema 5.1 dejamos c = 0, entonces p = 1. Esto, a su vez, hace g = {kn} ∞ n = 0, donde KN es una camarilla de n vértices. Luego, para cualquier KN, todos los titulares tendrán una aptitud idéntica y todos los mutantes tendrán una aptitud idéntica. Además, dado que S era un ESS para G, la aptitud titular será más alta que la aptitud mutante. Finalmente, se puede mostrar que, como n → ∞, la aptitud física titular converge a (1 -) f (s | s) + f (s | t), y la aptitud mutante converge a (1 -) f (t | s)+ F (t | t). En otras palabras, S debe ser un ESS clásico, proporcionando una conversación al Teorema 5.1. Presentamos rigurosamente este argumento en la Sección A.1.5.2 Gráficos adversos, mutaciones aleatorias ahora pasamos a nuestro segundo resultado principal. Aquí mostramos que si la familia de gráficos, en lugar de ser elegido al azar, está sujeto arbitrario a un requisito de grado mínimo, y los conjuntos de mutaciones se eligen al azar, el ESS clásico se conserva nuevamente. Una noción modificada de ESS nos permite debilitar considerablemente el requisito de grado a un requisito de densidad de borde mínimo. Teorema 5.2. Sea g = {gn = (vn, en)} ∞ n = 0 una familia infinita de gráficos en la que para todos v ∈ Vn, deg (v) = Ω (nγ) (para cualquier constante γ> 0). Sea F cualquier juego de 2 jugadores, simétrico, y supongamos que S es un esencia clásica de F. Sea cualquier estrategia mutante, y que la familia mutante m = {mn} ∞ n = 0 se elija al azar etiquetando cada vértice amutante con probabilidad constante, donde t >> 0. Luego, con la probabilidad 1, S es un ESS con respecto a F, G y M. 203 Prueba. Sea t = s la estrategia mutante y sea X el evento de que cada titular tiene aptitud dentro del rango (1 ± τ) [(1 -) f (s | s) + f (s | t)], para alguna constante constanteτ> 0 se especificará más adelante. Del mismo modo, sea el evento de que cada mutante tiene aptitud dentro del rango (1 ± τ) [(1 -) f (t | s) + f (t | t)]. Como pr (x ∩ y) = 1 - pr (¬x ∪ ¬y), procedemos mostrando pr (¬x ∪ ¬y) = o (1).¬x es el evento de que existe un titular con la aptitud fuera del rango (1 ± τ) [(1−) F (S | S)+ F (S | T)]. Si DEGM (V) denota el número de vecinos mutantes de V, de manera similar, Degi (V) denota el número de vecinos titulares de V, entonces un titular I tiene fitness degi (i) deg (i) f (s | s)+degm (i) deg (i) f (s | t). Dado que F (S | S) y F (S | T) son cantidades fijas, la única variación en una aptitud titular puede provenir de la variación en los términos DEGI (I) DEG (I) y DEGM (I) DEG (I). Uno puede usar el límite de Chernoff seguido de la unión obligado a mostrar que para cualquier titular I, PR (F (i) /∈ (1 ± τ) [(1 -) F (S | S) + F (S | T)]) <4 exp „ - deg (i) τ2 3«. Siguiente uno puede usar la unión unida nuevamente para unir la probabilidad del evento ¬x, PR (¬x) ≤ 4n exp „ - diτ2 3« donde di = mini∈V \\ m deg (i), 0 <≤ 1/2. Se puede hacer un argumento análogo para mostrar PR (¬y) <4n exp ( - dj τ2 3), donde dj = minj∈M deg (j) y 0 <≤ 1/2. Por lo tanto, por la unión unida, PR (¬x ∪ ¬y) <8n exp „ - dτ2 3« donde d = minv∈V deg (v), 0 <≤ 1/2. Ya que deg (v) = ω (nγ), para todos v ∈ V, y τ y γ son todas constantes mayores que 0, lim n → ∞ 8n exp (dτ2/3) = 0, entonces pr (¬x∪¬Y) = O (1). Por lo tanto, podemos elegir τ lo suficientemente pequeño como como para (1 + τ) [(1 -) f (t | s) + f (t | t)] <(1 - τ) [(1 -) f (s | s | s)+ F (s | t)], y luego elija n lo suficientemente grande como para que con la probabilidad 1 - o (1), cada titular tendrá aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1−) f (s | s | s | s) + F (s | t)], y cada mutante tendrá aptitud en el rango (1 ± τ) [(1 -) f (t | s) + f (t | t)]. Entonces, con alta probabilidad, cada titular tendrá una condición física más alta que cada mutante. Por argumentos similares a los que siguen la prueba del teorema 5.1, si dejamos que G = {KN} ∞ n = 0, cada titular tendrá la misma aptitud y cada mutante tendrá la misma aptitud. Además, dado que S es un ESS para G, la aptitud titular debe ser más alta que la aptitud mutante. Aquí nuevamente, uno tiene que mostrar que, como n → ∞, la aptitud física titular converge a (1 -) f (s | s) + f (s | t), y la aptitud mutante converge a (1 -) f (t| s) + f (t | t). Observe que los mutantes de la fracción exacta de VN es ahora una variable aleatoria. Entonces, para probar esta convergencia, utilizamos un argumento similar a uno que se usa para demostrar que la secuencia de variables aleatorias que converge en probabilidad también converge en la distribución (detalles omitidos). Esto a su vez establece que S debe ser un ESS clásico, y así obtenemos un Converso al Teorema 5.2. Este argumento se hace riguroso en la sección A.2. La suposición en el grado de cada vértice del Teorema 5.2 es bastante fuerte. El siguiente teorema relaja este requisito y solo requiere que cada gráfico tenga bordes N1+γ, para algunos γ> 0 constantes, en cuyo caso muestra que siempre habrá al menos 1 mutante con un vecino titular de la aptitud superior. Una estrategia que es un ESS en este sentido debilitado esencialmente descartará conjuntos estables y estáticos de invasiones mutantes, pero no más complejas invasiones. Un ejemplo de invasiones más complejas son conjuntos mutantes que sobreviven, pero solo al migrar perpetuamente a través del gráfico bajo una dinámica evolutiva natural, similar a los planeadores en el conocido juego de la vida [1]. Teorema 5.3. Sea F cualquier juego, y sea un esencia clásica de F, y sea T = S una estrategia mutante. Para cualquier familia de gráficos g = {gn = (vn, en)} ∞ n = 0 en el que | en |≥ N1+γ (para cualquier constante γ> 0), y cualquier familia mutante m = {mn} ∞ n = 0 que se determina etiquetando a cada vértice un mutante con probabilidad, donde t>> 0, la probabilidad de que exista AMutante con un vecino titular de los enfoques de aptitud superior 1 como n → ∞. Prueba.(Sketch) La idea principal detrás de la prueba es mostrar que con alta probabilidad, solo sobre la elección de mutantes, habrá un borde mutante titular en el que ambos vértices tienen alto grado. Si su título es lo suficientemente alto, podemos demostrar que cerca de una fracción de sus vecinos son mutantes y, por lo tanto, sus fitness están muy cerca de lo que esperamos que estén en el caso clásico. Como S es un ESS, la aptitud del titular será más alta que el mutante. Llamamos un borde (i, j) ∈ En a g (n) -barbell si deg (i) ≥ g (n) y deg (j) ≥ g (n). Supongamos que GN tiene como máximo h (n) bordes que son G (N) -barbells. Esto significa que hay al menos | en |- h (n) bordes en los que al menos un vértice tiene grado como máximo G (n). Llamamos a estos vértices vértices ligeros. Sea (n) el número de vértices de luz en Gn. Observe que | en | −H (n) ≤ (n) g (n). Esto se debe a que cada vértice de luz es incidente en la mayoría de los bordes G (N). Esto nos da eso | en |≤ h (n) + (n) g (n) ≤ h (n) + ng (n). Entonces, si elegimos h (n) y g (n) tal que h (n) + ng (n) = o (n1 + γ), entonces | en |= O (N1+γ). Esto contradice la suposición de que | en |= Ω (N1+γ). Por lo tanto, sujeto a la restricción anterior en H (N) y G (N), GN debe contener al menos H (N) bordes que son G (N) -Barbells. Ahora deje que HN denote el subgrafio inducido por los bordes de la barra de GN. Tenga en cuenta que, independientemente de la estructura de GN, no hay razón para que HN esté conectado. Por lo tanto, sea M el número de componentes conectados de HN, y deje C1, C2 ,..., cm será el número de vértices en cada uno de estos componentes conectados. Tenga en cuenta que dado que HN es un subgrafio inducido por el borde, tenemos CK ≥ 2 para todos los componentes k.Elegamos el conjunto de mutantes lanzando primero los vértices solo en HN. Ahora mostramos que la probabilidad, con respecto al conjunto mutante aleatorio, que ninguno de los componentes de HN tiene un borde mutante titular es exponencialmente pequeño en n.Sea un evento en que cada componente de HN contenga solo mutantes o solo titulares. Luego, las manipulaciones algebraicas pueden establecer que PR [an] = πm k = 1 (ck + (1 -) ck) ≤ (1 -) (1− β2 2) PM K = 1 CK 204 donde β es una constante. Por lo tanto, para el límite suficientemente pequeño, el límite disminuye exponencialmente con PM K = 1 CK. Además, desde ppm k = 1 `ck 2 ´ ≥ h (n) (con la igualdad lograda al hacer que cada componente sea una camarilla), se puede mostrar que pm k = 1 ck ≥ p h (n). Por lo tanto, siempre que h (n) → ∞ con n, la probabilidad de que todos los componentes estén etiquetados uniformemente irá a 0. Ahora, suponiendo que existe un componente etiquetado no uniforme, mediante la construcción de ese componente contiene un borde (i, j) donde yo es un titular y J es un mutante, es decir, un barbell G (n). También suponemos que los vértices H (n) ya etiquetados se han hecho tan arbitrarios, pero que los vértices G (N) - H (N) restantes vecinos se etiquetan mutantes de forma independiente con probabilidad. Luego, a través de un argumento estándar de Chernoff, uno puede mostrar que con alta probabilidad, la fracción de mutantes vecinos y la fracción de mutantes vecinos j está en el rango (1 ± τ) (g (n) -h (n)) g(n). Del mismo modo, uno puede mostrar que la fracción de los titulares vecinos I y la fracción de mutantes vecinos J está en el rango 1 - (1 ± τ) (g (n) −H (n)) g (n). Como S es un ESS, existe un ζ> 0 tal que (1 -) F (S | S) + F (S | T) = (1 -) F (T | S) + F (T | T) + +ζ. Si elegimos g (n) = nγ, y h (n) = o (g (n)), podemos elegir n lo suficientemente grande y τ lo suficientemente pequeño como para forzar f (i)> f (j), como se desea.6. Limitaciones de modelos más fuertes en esta sección, mostramos que si uno intentaba fortalecer el modelo descrito en la Sección 3 de dos maneras naturales, uno no podría demostrar resultados tan fuertes como los teoremas 5.1 y 5.2, que se mantienen para cada 2 jugadores,juego simétrico.6.1 Contracción más fuerte para el conjunto mutante en la Sección 3 aludimos al hecho de que tomamos ciertas decisiones de diseño al llegar a las definiciones 3.1, 3.2 y 3.3. Una de esas decisiones era exigir que todos los mutantes menos o (n) tengan vecinos titulares de una condición física más alta. En cambio, podríamos haber requerido que todos los mutantes tengan un vecino titular de la fitness superior. Los dos teoremas en esta subsección muestran que si se fortaleciera nuestra noción de contracción para el conjunto mutante, dada por la definición 3.1, de esta manera, sería imposible demostrar teoremas análogos a los teoremas 5.1 y 5.3. Recuerde que la definición 3.1 dio la noción de contracción para un subconjunto de mutantes de tamaño lineal. En lo que sigue, diremos una ventaja (i, j) contrata si yo es un titular, j es un mutante y f (i)> f (j). Además, recuerde que el Teorema 5.1 declaró que si S es un ESS clásico, entonces es un ESS para gráficos aleatorios con mutaciones adversas. A continuación, demostramos que si requerimos que cada borde mutante titular se contraiga, este no es necesario que sea el caso. Teorema 6.1. Sea F un juego simétrico de 2 jugadores que tiene un esencia clásica para el que existe una estrategia mutante t = s con f (t | t)> f (s | s) y f (t | t)> f (s | t). Sea G = {Gn} ∞ n = 0 una familia infinita de gráficos aleatorios dibujados de acuerdo con Gn, p, donde p = ω (1/nc) para cualquier constante 0 ≤ c <1. Luego, con probabilidad acercándose a 1 como n → ∞, existe una familia mutante m = {mn} ∞ n = 0, donde tn> | mn |> n y t,> 0, en el que hay un borde que no se contrae. Prueba.(Boceto) Con probabilidad acercándose a 1 como n → ∞, existe un vértice j donde el deg (j) está arbitrariamente cerca de n.Así que etiqueta J Mutant, etiqueta a uno de sus vecinos titulares, denotó I y etiqueta el resto del Mutante del vecindario JS. Además, la etiqueta todo es vecinos titulares, con la excepción de los vecinos J y JS (que ya estaban etiquetados como mutantes). En este entorno, se puede demostrar que F (j) estará arbitrariamente cerca de F (t | t) y f (i) será una combinación convexa de f (s | s) y f (s | t), que sonambos estrictamente menos que f (t | t). Teorema 5.3 declaró que si S es un ESS clásico, entonces para gráficos donde | en |≥ N1+γ, para algunos γ> 0, y donde cada organismo se etiqueta como mutante con probabilidad, un borde debe contraerse. A continuación mostramos que, para ciertos gráficos y ciertos juegos, siempre existirá un borde que no se contraerá. Teorema 6.2. Sea f un juego simétrico de 2 jugadores que tiene un esencia clásica, de modo que existe una estrategia mutante t = s donde f (t | s)> f (s | t). Existe una familia infinita de gráficos {gn = (vn, en)} ∞ n = 0, donde | en |= Θ (n2), de modo que para una familia mutante m = {mn} ∞ n = 0, que se determina etiquetando a cada vértice un mutante con probabilidad> 0, la probabilidad existe un borde en EN que no contrata se acerca 1 1como n → ∞. Prueba.(Boceto) Construya GN de la siguiente manera. Elija N/4 Vértices U1, U2 ,..., un/4 y agregue bordes de tal manera que sean de una camarilla. Luego, para cada ui, i ∈ [n/4] agregue bordes (ui, vi), (vi, wi) y (wi, xi). Con la probabilidad 1 como n → ∞, existe una i tal que UI y WI son mutantes y VI y XI son titulares. Observe que f (vi) = f (xi) = f (s | t) y f (wi) = f (t | s).6.2 Contracción más fuerte para los individuos El modelo de la Sección 3 requiere que para un borde (i, j) se contraiga, la aptitud de I debe ser mayor que la aptitud de j. Una forma de fortalecer esta noción de contracción sería requerir que el aptitud máxima en el vecindario de J sea más en forma que el mutante máximo de aptitud en el vecindario de J. Esto modela la idea de que cada organismo está tratando de hacerse cargo de cada lugar en su vecindario, pero solo el organismo más en forma en el vecindario de un vértice tiene el privilegio de tomarlo. Si suponemos que adoptamos esta noción de contracción para mutantes individuales, y exigimos que todos los bordes mutantes titulares sean contratados, mostraremos que los teoremas 6.1 y 6.2 aún se mantienen, y por lo tanto es imposible obtener resultados como los teoremas 5.1 y5.3 que se mantienen por cada juego simétrico de 2 jugadores. En la prueba del teorema 6.1 demostramos que F (i) es estrictamente menor que f (j). Observe que el mutante máximo de fitness en el vecindario de J debe tener fitness al menos F (j). También observe que solo hay 1 titular en el vecindario de J, a saber i. Entonces, bajo esta noción más fuerte de contracción, el borde (i, j) no se contraerá. Del mismo modo, en la prueba del teorema 6.2, observe que el único mutante en el vecindario de WI es WI, que tiene aptitud f (t | s). Además, los únicos titulares en el vecindario de WI son VI y XI, los cuales tienen fitness f (s | t). Por suposición, f (t | s)> f (s | t), por lo tanto, bajo esta noción más fuerte de contracción, ninguno de los bordes titulares, (vi, wi) y (xi, wi) se contraerán.7. Referencias [1] Elwyn R.

ES gráfico y clásico en esta sección Exploramos las condiciones bajo las cuales un ESS gráfico también es un ESS clásico. Para hacerlo, declaramos y probamos dos teoremas que proporcionan conversaciones a cada uno de los principales teoremas en la Sección 3. A.1 Gráficos aleatorios, Mutaciones adversas Teorema 5.2 establece que si S es un ESS clásico y G = {Gn, P}, donde P = Ω (1/NC) y 0 ≤ C <1, entonces con probabilidad 1 AS N →∞, S es un esencia con respecto a G. Aquí mostramos que si S es un esencia con respecto a G, entonces S es un esencia clásica. Para probar este teorema, no necesitamos que la generalidad completa de S sea un ESS para G cuando p = ω (1/nc) donde 0 ≤ c <1. Todo lo que necesitamos es ser un ESS para G cuando P = 1. En este caso, no hay más eventos probabilísticos en la declaración del teorema. Además, dado que p = 1 cada gráfico en G es una camarilla, por lo que si un titular tiene una aptitud más alta que un mutante, entonces todos los titulares tienen una condición física más alta que todos los mutantes. Esto da lugar al siguiente teorema. Teorema A.1. Sea que F sea un juego de 2 jugadores, y suponga que S es una estrategia para F y T = S es una estrategia mutante. Sea g = {kn} ∞ n = 0. Si, como n → ∞, para cualquier familia de mutantes t-lineal m = {mn} ∞ n = 0, existe un titular I y un mutante j tal que f (i)> f (j), entonces s es unESS clásico de F. La prueba de este teorema analiza el comportamiento limitante de la población mutante como el tamaño de las camarillas en G tiende al infinito. También muestra cómo la definición de ESS dada en la Sección 5 recupera la definición clásica de ESS. Prueba. Dado que cada gráfico en G es una camarilla, cada titular tendrá el mismo número de vecinos titulares y mutantes, y cada mutante tendrá el mismo número de vecinos titulares y mutantes. Por lo tanto, todos los titulares tendrán una aptitud idéntica y todos los mutantes tendrán una aptitud idéntica. A continuación, se puede construir una familia mutante t-lineal m, donde la fracción de mutantes converge para cualquiera, donde t>> 0. Entonces, para N lo suficientemente grande, el número de mutantes en KN estará arbitrariamente cerca de N.Por lo tanto, cualquier subconjunto mutante de tamaño n dará como resultado que todos los titulares tengan aptitud física (1 - n n - 1) f (s | s) + n n - 1 f (s | t), y todos los mutantes que tienen aptitud (1 - n - 1n - 1) f (t | s) + n - 1 n - 1 f (t | t). Además, por supuesto, la aptitud titular debe ser más alta que la aptitud mutante. Esto implica, lim n → ∞ „(1 - n n - 1) f (s | s) + n n - 1 f (s | t)> (1 - n - 1 n - 1) f (t | s) + n- 1 n - 1 f (t | t) «= 1. Esto implica, (1−) F (S | S)+ F (S | T)> (1−) F (T | S)+ F (T | T), para todos, donde t >> 0. A.2 Gráficos adversos, el teorema de mutaciones aleatorias 5.2 establece que si S es un ESS clásico para un juego simétrico de 2 jugadores F, donde G se elige adversarmente sujeto a la restricción de que el grado de cada vértice es ω (Nγ) (para cualquier constanteγ> 0), y los mutantes se eligen con probabilidad, entonces S es un esencia con respecto a F, G y M. Aquí mostramos que si S es un ESS con respecto a F, G y M, entonces S es un clásicoEsencia Todo lo que necesitaremos para demostrar que esto es que S es un ESS con respecto a G = {KN} ∞ n = 0, es cuando cada vértice tiene grado n - 1. Como en el Teorema A.1, dado que las gráficas son camarillas, si un titular tiene una aptitud más alta que un mutante, entonces todos los titulares tienen una condición física más alta que todos los mutantes. Por lo tanto, el teorema a continuación también es una conversación al teorema 5.3.(Recuerde que el Teorema 5.3 utiliza una noción más débil de contracción de que 206 requiere solo un titular para tener una aptitud más alta que un mutante). Teorema A.2. Sea que F sea un juego simétrico de 2 jugadores, y suponga que S es una estrategia titular para F y T = S es una estrategia mutante. Sea g = {kn} ∞ n = 0. Si con la probabilidad 1 como n → ∞, S es un ESS para g y una familia mutante m = {mn} ∞ n = 0, que se determina etiquetando cada vértice un mutante con probabilidad, donde t>> 0, entonces s es s esUn ESS clásico de F. Esta prueba también analiza el comportamiento limitante de la población mutante, ya que el tamaño de las camarillas en G tiende al infinito. Dado que los mutantes se eligen al azar, utilizaremos un argumento similar a la prueba de que una secuencia de variables aleatorias que converge en probabilidad, también convergen en la distribución. En este caso, la secuencia de variables aleatorias será una fracción real de mutantes en cada KN. Prueba. Corrige cualquier valor de, donde n>> 0, y construya cada mn etiquetando un vértice un mutante con probabilidad. Por el mismo argumento que en la prueba del teorema A.1, si el número real de mutantes en KN se denota por nn, cualquier subconjunto mutante de tamaño nn dará como resultado que todos los titulares tengan aptitud física (1 - nn n - 1) f (s | s) + nn n - 1 f (s | t), y en todos los mutantes que tienen aptitud (1 - nn - 1 n - 1) f (t | s) + nn - 1 n - 1 f (t | t). Esto implica lim n → ∞ pr (s es un ESS para gn w.r.t. nn mutantes) = 1 ⇒ lim n → ∞ pr „(1 - nn n - 1) f (s | s) + nn n - 1 f (s |t)> (1 - nn - 1 n - 1) f (t | s) + nn - 1 n - 1 f (t | t) «= 1 ⇔ lim n → ∞ pr„ n> f (t | s)- f (s | s) f (s | t) - f (s | s) - f (t | t) + f (t | s) + f (s | s) - f (t | t) n «= 1 (3) Por dos aplicaciones simples del Chernoff Bound y una aplicación de la unión unida, se puede mostrar la secuencia de variables aleatorias {n} ∞ n = 0 converge en probabilidad. A continuación, si dejamos xn = - n, x = -, b = −f (s | s) + f (t | t), y a = - f (t | s) −f (s | s) f (s | t) −f (s | s) −f (t | t) + f (t | s), por el teorema A.3 a continuación, obtenemos esa limn → ∞ pr (xn <a + b/n) = =PR (x <a). Combinando esto con la ecuación 3, pr (> −a) = 1. La prueba del siguiente teorema es muy similar a la prueba de que una secuencia de variables aleatorias que converge en probabilidad, también convergen en la distribución. Una buena explicación de esto se puede encontrar en [9], que es la base del argumento a continuación. Teorema A.3. Si {xn} ∞ n = 0 es una secuencia de variables aleatorias que convergen en probabilidad a la variable aleatoria x, y a y b son constantes, entonces limn → ∞ pr (xn <a+b/n) = pr (x <a). Prueba. Por Lemma A.1 (ver más abajo) Tenemos las siguientes dos desigualdades, PR (x <a + b/n - τ) ≤ PR (xn <a + b/n) + pr (| x - xn |> τ), Pr (xn <a + b/n) ≤ pr (x <a + b/n + τ) + pr (| x - xn |> τ). Combinando estos Da, PR (x <a + b/n - τ) - pr (| x - xn |> τ) ≤ pr (xn <a + b/n) ≤ pr (x <a + b/n + τ) + Pr (| x - xn |> τ). Existe un n0 tal que para todos n> n0, | b/n |<τ, entonces la siguiente declaración es válida para todos n> n0. Pr (x <a - 2τ) - pr (| x - xn |> τ) ≤ pr (xn <a + b/n) ≤ pr (x <a + 2τ) + pr (| x - xn |> τ). Tome la limn → ∞ de ambos lados de ambas desigualdades, y dado que xn converge en probabilidad a x, pr (x <a - 2τ) ≤ lim n → ∞ pr (xn <a + b/n) (4) ≤ pR (X <a + 2τ).(5) Recuerde que X es una variable aleatoria continua que representa la fracción de mutantes en un gráfico de tamaño infinito. Entonces, si dejamos que Fx (a) = PR (x <a), vemos que Fx (a) es una función de distribución acumulativa de una variable aleatoria continua y, por lo tanto, es continuo de la derecha. Entonces lim τ ↓ 0 fx (a - τ) = lim τ ↓ 0 fx (a + τ) = fx (a). Por lo tanto, si tomamos el limτ ↓ 0 de las desigualdades 4 y 5 obtenemos pr (x <a) = lim n → ∞ pr (xn <a + b/n). El siguiente lema es bastante útil, ya que expresa la distribución acumulativa de una variable aleatoria y, en términos de la distribución acumulativa de otra variable aleatoria x y la diferencia entre x e y. Lema A.1. Si x e y son variables aleatorias, c ∈ y τ> 0, entonces pr (y <c) ≤ pr (x <c + τ) + pr (| y - x |> τ). Prueba. Pr (y <c) = pr (y <c, x <c + τ) + pr (y <c, x ≥ c + τ) ≤ pr (y <c | x <c + τ) pr (x <c+ τ) + pr (| y - x |> τ) ≤ pr (x <c + τ) + pr (| y - x |> τ) 207",

        "CLASSICAL EGT The fundamental concept of evolutionary game theory is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).",
        "Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the population [17].",
        "To make this more precise, we describe the basic model of evolutionary game theory, in which the notion of an ESS resides.",
        "The standard model of evolutionary game theory considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game.",
        "The game is defined by a fitness function F. All pairs of members of the infinite population are equally likely to interact with one another.",
        "If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s 200 and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s).",
        "In this infinite population of organisms, suppose there is a 1 − fraction who play strategy s, and call these organisms incumbents; and suppose there is an fraction who play t, and call these organisms mutants.",
        "Assume two organisms are chosen uniformly at random to play each other.",
        "The strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t, for all t = s and all sufficiently small .",
        "Since an incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability 1 − and it will meet a mutant with probability , we can calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent, which is simply (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t).",
        "Similarly, the expected fitness of a mutant is (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).",
        "Thus we come to the formal definition of an ESS [19].",
        "Definition 2.1.",
        "A strategy s is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the 2-player, symmetric game given by fitness function F, if for every strategy t = s, there exists an t such that for all 0 < < t, (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).",
        "A consequence of this definition is that for s to be an ESS, it must be the case that F(s|s) ≥ F(t|s), for all strategies t. This inequality means that s must be a best response to itself, and thus any ESS strategy s must also be a Nash equilibrium.",
        "In general the notion of ESS is more restrictive than Nash equilibrium, and not all 2-player, symmetric games have an ESS.",
        "In this paper our interest is to examine what kinds of network structure preserve the ESS strategies for those games that do have a standard ESS.",
        "First we must of course generalize the definition of ESS to a network setting. 3.",

        "Before giving formal definitions, some comments are in order on what to expect in moving from the classical to the graph-theoretic setting.",

        "Indeed, such asymmetries are the primary interest in examining a graph-theoretic generalization.",
        "For example, at the group level, in the standard ESS definition, one need not discuss any particular set of mutants of population fraction .",
        "Since all organisms are equally likely to interact, the survival or fate of any specific mutant set is identical to that of any other.",
        "In the network setting, this may not be true: some mutant sets may be better able to survive than others due to the specific topologies of their interactions in the network.",
        "For instance, foreshadowing some of our analysis, if s is an ESS but F(t|t) is much larger than F(s|s) and F(s|t), a mutant set with a great deal of internal interaction (that is, edges between mutants) may be able to survive, whereas one without this may suffer.",
        "At the level of individuals, in the classical setting, the assertion that one mutant dies implies that all mutants die, again by symmetry.",
        "In the network setting, individual fates may differ within a group all playing a common strategy.",
        "These observations imply that in examining ESS on networks we face definitional choices that were obscured in the classical model.",
        "If G is a graph representing the allowed pairwise interactions between organisms (vertices), and u is a vertex of G playing strategy su, then the fitness of u is given by F(u) = P v∈Γ(u) F(su|sv) |Γ(u)| .",
        "Here sv is the strategy being played by the neighbor v, and Γ(u) = {v ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E}.",

        "Classical evolutionary game theory examines an infinite, symmetric population.",
        "Graphs or networks are inherently finite objects, and we are specifically interested in their asymmetries, as discussed above.",
        "Thus all of our definitions shall revolve around an infinite family G = {Gn}∞ n=0 of finite graphs Gn over n vertices, but we shall examine asymptotic (large n) properties of such families.",
        "We first give a definition for a family of mutant vertex sets in such an infinite graph family to contract.",

        "Suppose all the vertices of Mn play a common (mutant) strategy t, and suppose the remaining vertices in Gn play a common (incumbent) strategy s. We say that Mn contracts if for sufficiently large n, for all but o(n) of the j ∈ Mn, j has an incumbent neighbor i such that F(j) < F(i).",
        "A reasonable alternative would be to ask that the condition above hold for all mutants rather than all but o(n).",
        "Note also that we only require that a mutant have one incumbent neighbor of higher fitness in order to die; one might considering requiring more.",
        "In Sections 6.1 and 6.2 we consider these stronger conditions and demonstrate that our results can no longer hold.",
        "In order to properly define an ESS for an infinite family of finite graphs in a way that recovers the classical definition asymptotically in the case of the family of complete graphs, we first must give a definition that restricts attention to families of mutant vertices that are smaller than some invasion threshold n, yet remain some constant fraction of the population.",

        "Let M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be any family of (mutant) vertices in Gn.",
        "We say that M is -linear if there exists an , > > 0, such that for all sufficiently large n, n > |Mn| > n. We can now give our definition for a strategy to be evolutionarily stable when employed by organisms interacting with their neighborhood in a graph. 201 Definition 3.3.",
        "Let G = {Gn}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs, where Gn has n vertices.",
        "Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game for which s is a strategy.",

        "Thus, to violate the ESS property for G, one must witness a family of mutations M in which each Mn is an arbitrarily small but nonzero constant fraction of the population of Gn, but does not contract (i.e. every mutant set has a subset of linear size that survives all of its incumbent interactions).",
        "In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in the case where G is the family of complete graphs, in the limit of large n. We note that even in the classical model, small sets of mutants were allowed to have greater fitness than the incumbents, as long as the size of the set was o(n) [18].",
        "In the definition above there are three parameters: the game F, the graph family G and the mutation family M. Our main results will hold for any 2-player, symmetric game F. We will also study two rather general settings for G and M: that in which G is a family of random graphs and M is arbitrary, and that in which G is nearly arbitrary and M is randomly chosen.",
        "In both cases, we will see that, subject to conditions on degree or edge density (essentially forcing connectivity of G but not much more), for any 2-player, symmetric game, the ESS of the classical settings, and only those strategies, are always preserved.",
        "Thus a common theme of these results is the power of randomization: as long as either the network itself is chosen randomly, or the mutation set is chosen randomly, classical ESS are preserved. 4.",
        "RELATED WORK There has been previous work that analyzes which strategies are resilient to mutant invasions with respect to various types of graphs.",
        "What sets our work apart is that the model we consider encompasses a significantly more general class of games and graph topologies.",
        "We will briefly survey this literature and point out the differences in the previous models and ours.",
        "In [8], [3], and [4], the authors consider specific families of graphs, such as cycles and lattices, where players play specific games, such as 2 × 2-games or k × k-coordination games.",
        "In these papers the authors specify a simple, local dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing strategies, and analyze what type of strategies will grow to dominate the population.",
        "The model we propose is more general than both of these, as it encompasses a larger class of graphs as well as a richer set of games.",
        "Also related to our work is that of [14], where the authors propose two models.",
        "The first assumes organisms interact according to a weighted, undirected graph.",
        "However, the fitness of each organism is simply assigned and does not depend on the actions of each organisms neighborhood.",
        "The second model has organisms arranged around a directed cycle, where neighbors play a 2 × 2-game.",
        "With probability proportional to its fitness, an organism is chosen to reproduce by placing a replica of itself in its neighbors position, thereby killing the neighbor.",
        "We consider more general games than the first model and more general graphs than the second.",
        "Finally, the works most closely related to ours are [7], [15], and [6].",
        "The authors consider 2-action, coordination games played by players in a general undirected graph.",
        "In these three works, the authors specify a dynamic for a strategy to reproduce, and analyze properties of the graph that allow a strategy to overrun the population.",
        "Here again, one can see that our model is more general than these, as it allows for organisms to play any 2-player, symmetric game. 5.",
        "NETWORKS PRESERVING ESS We now proceed to state and prove two complementary results in the network ESS model defined in Section 3.",
        "First, we consider a setting where the graphs are generated via the Gn,p model of Erd˝os and R´enyi [5].",
        "In this model, every pair of vertices are joined by an edge independently and with probability p (where p may depend on n).",
        "The mutant set, however, will be constructed adversarially (subject to the linear size constraint given by Definition 3.3).",
        "For these settings, we show that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS of that game, if and only if s is an ESS for {Gn,p}∞ n=0, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1, and any mutant family {Mn}∞ n=0, where each Mn has linear size.",
        "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",
        "It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.",
        "Thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge density.",
        "The second result is a kind of dual to the first, considering a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily (subject to conditions) but the mutant sets are chosen randomly.",
        "It states that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS for that game, if and only if s is an ESS for any {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0), and a family of mutant sets {Mn}∞ n=0, that is chosen randomly (that is, in which each organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability > 0).",
        "Thus, in this setting we again find that classical ESS are preserved subject to edge density restrictions.",
        "Since the degree assumption is somewhat strong, we also prove another result which only assumes that |En| ≥ n1+γ , and shows that there must exist at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness (as opposed to showing that all but o(n) mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness).",
        "As will be discussed, this rules out stationary mutant invasions. 5.1 Random Graphs, Adversarial Mutations Now we state and prove a theorem which shows that if s is a classical ESS, then s will be an ESS for random graphs, where a linear sized set of mutants is chosen by an adversary.",
        "Theorem 5.1.",
        "Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game, and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let the infinite graph family {Gn}∞ n=0 be drawn according to Gn,p, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1.",
        "Then with probability 1, s is an ESS.",
        "The main idea of the proof is to divide mutants into 2 categories, those with normal fitness and those with ab202 normal fitness.",
        "First, we show all but o(n) of the population (incumbent or mutant) have an incumbent neighbor of normal fitness.",
        "This will imply that all but o(n) of the mutants of normal fitness have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.",
        "The vehicle for proving this is Theorem 2.15 of [5], which gives an upper bound on the number of vertices not connected to a sufficiently large set.",
        "This theorem assumes that the size of this large set is known with equality, which necessitates the union bound argument below.",
        "Secondly, we show that there can be at most o(n) mutants with abnormal fitness.",
        "Since there are so few of them, even if none of them have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness, s will still be an ESS with respect to F and G. Proof. (Sketch) Let t = s be the mutant strategy.",
        "Since s is a classical ESS, there exists an t such that (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t), for all 0 < < t. Let M be any mutant family that is t-linear.",
        "Thus for any fixed value of n that is sufficiently large, there exists an such that |Mn| = n and t > > 0.",
        "Also, let In = Vn \\ Mn and let I ⊆ In be the set of incumbents that have fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)] for some constant τ, 0 < τ < 1/6.",
        "Lemma 5.1 below shows (1 − )n ≥ |I | ≥ (1 − )n − 24 log n τ2p .",
        "Finally, let TI = {x ∈ V \\ I : Γ(x) ∩ I = ∅}. (For the sake of clarity we suppress the subscript n on the sets I and T.) The union bound gives us Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤ (1− )n X i=(1− )n− 24 log n τ2p Pr(|TI | ≥ δn and |I | = i) (1) Letting δ = n−γ for some γ > 0 gives δn = o(n).",
        "We will apply Theorem 2.15 of [5] to the summand on the right hand side of Equation 1.",
        "If we let γ = (1−c)/2, and combine this with the fact that 0 ≤ c < 1, all of the requirements of this theorem will be satisfied (details omitted).",
        "Now when we apply this theorem to Equation 1, we get Pr(|TI | ≥ δn) ≤ (1− )n X i=(1− )n− 24 log n τ2p exp „ − 1 6 Cδn « (2) = o(1) This is because equation 2 has only 24 log n τ2p terms, and Theorem 2.15 of [5] gives us that C ≥ (1 − )n1−c − 24 log n τ2 .",
        "Thus we have shown, with probability tending to 1 as n → ∞, at most o(n) individuals are not attached to an incumbent which has fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)].",
        "This implies that the number of mutants of approximately normal fitness, not attached to an incumbent of approximately normal fitness, is also o(n).",
        "Now those mutants of approximately normal fitness that are attached to an incumbent of approximately normal fitness have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t)].",
        "The incumbents that they are attached to have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)].",
        "Since s is an ESS of F, we know (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) > (1− )F(t|s)+ F(t|t), thus if we choose τ small enough, we can ensure that all but o(n) mutants of normal fitness have a neighboring incumbent of higher fitness.",
        "Finally by Lemma 5.1, we know there are at most o(n) mutants of abnormal fitness.",
        "So even if all of them are more fit than their respective incumbent neighbors, we have shown all but o(n) of the mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.",
        "We now state and prove the lemma used in the proof above.",
        "Lemma 5.1.",
        "For almost every graph Gn,p with (1 − )n incumbents, all but 24 log n δ2p incumbents have fitness in the range (1±δ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], where p = Ω(1/nc ) and , δ and c are constants satisfying 0 < < 1, 0 < δ < 1/6, 0 ≤ c < 1.",
        "Similarly, under the same assumptions, all but 24 log n δ2p mutants have fitness in the range (1 ± δ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)].",
        "Proof.",
        "We define the mutant degree of a vertex to be the number of mutant neighbors of that vertex, and incumbent degree analogously.",
        "Observe that the only way for an incumbent to have fitness far from its expected value of (1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t) is if it has a fraction of mutant neighbors either much higher or much lower than .",
        "Theorem 2.14 of [5] gives us a bound on the number of such incumbents.",
        "It states that the number of incumbents with mutant degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|M| is at most 12 log n δ2p .",
        "By the same theorem, the number of incumbents with incumbent degree outside the range (1 ± δ)p|I| is at most 12 log n δ2p .",
        "From the linearity of fitness as a function of the fraction of mutant or incumbent neighbors, one can show that for those incumbents with mutant and incumbent degree in the expected range, their fitness is within a constant factor of (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), where that constant goes to 1 as n tends to infinity and δ tends to 0.",
        "The proof for the mutant case is analogous.",
        "We note that if in the statement of Theorem 5.1 we let c = 0, then p = 1.",
        "This, in turn, makes G = {Kn}∞ n=0, where Kn is a clique of n vertices.",
        "Then for any Kn all of the incumbents will have identical fitness and all of the mutants will have identical fitness.",
        "Furthermore, since s was an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness will be higher than the mutant fitness.",
        "Finally, one can show that as n → ∞, the incumbent fitness converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and the mutant fitness converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).",
        "In other words, s must be a classical ESS, providing a converse to Theorem 5.1.",
        "We rigorously present this argument in Section A.1. 5.2 Adversarial Graphs, Random Mutations We now move on to our second main result.",
        "Here we show that if the graph family, rather than being chosen randomly, is arbitrary subject to a minimum degree requirement, and the mutation sets are randomly chosen, classical ESS are again preserved.",
        "A modified notion of ESS allows us to considerably weaken the degree requirement to a minimum edge density requirement.",
        "Theorem 5.2.",
        "Let G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 be an infinite family of graphs in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0).",
        "Let F be any 2-player, symmetric game, and suppose s is a classical ESS of F. Let t be any mutant strategy, and let the mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0 be chosen randomly by labeling each vertex a mutant with constant probability , where t > > 0.",
        "Then with probability 1, s is an ESS with respect to F, G and M. 203 Proof.",
        "Let t = s be the mutant strategy and let X be the event that every incumbent has fitness within the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)], for some constant τ > 0 to be specified later.",
        "Similarly, let Y be the event that every mutant has fitness within the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)].",
        "Since Pr(X ∩ Y ) = 1 − Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ), we proceed by showing Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) = o(1). ¬X is the event that there exists an incumbent with fitness outside the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)].",
        "If degM (v) denotes the number of mutant neighbors of v, similarly, degI (v) denotes the number of incumbent neighbors of v, then an incumbent i has fitness degI (i) deg(i) F(s|s)+ degM (i) deg(i) F(s|t).",
        "Since F(s|s) and F(s|t) are fixed quantities, the only variation in an incumbents fitness can come from variation in the terms degI (i) deg(i) and degM (i) deg(i) .",
        "One can use the Chernoff bound followed by the union bound to show that for any incumbent i, Pr(F(i) /∈ (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t)]) < 4 exp „ − deg(i)τ2 3 « .",
        "Next one can use the union bound again to bound the probability of the event ¬X, Pr(¬X) ≤ 4n exp „ − diτ2 3 « where di = mini∈V \\M deg(i), 0 < ≤ 1/2.",
        "An analogous argument can be made to show Pr(¬Y ) < 4n exp(− dj τ2 3 ), where dj = minj∈M deg(j) and 0 < ≤ 1/2.",
        "Thus, by the union bound, Pr(¬X ∪ ¬Y ) < 8n exp „ − dτ2 3 « where d = minv∈V deg(v), 0 < ≤ 1/2.",
        "Since deg(v) = Ω(nγ ), for all v ∈ V , and , τ and γ are all constants greater than 0, lim n→∞ 8n exp ( dτ2/3) = 0, so Pr(¬X∪¬Y ) = o(1).",
        "Thus, we can choose τ small enough such that (1 + τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)] < (1 − τ)[(1 − )F(s|s)+ F(s|t)], and then choose n large enough such that with probability 1 − o(1), every incumbent will have fitness in the range (1±τ)[(1− )F(s|s)+F(s|t)], and every mutant will have fitness in the range (1 ± τ)[(1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t)].",
        "So with high probability, every incumbent will have a higher fitness than every mutant.",
        "By arguments similar to those following the proof of Theorem 5.1, if we let G = {Kn}∞ n=0, each incumbent will have the same fitness and each mutant will have the same fitness.",
        "Furthermore, since s is an ESS for G, the incumbent fitness must be higher than the mutant fitness.",
        "Here again, one has to show show that as n → ∞, the incumbent fitness converges to (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t), and the mutant fitness converges to (1 − )F(t|s) + F(t|t).",
        "Observe that the exact fraction mutants of Vn is now a random variable.",
        "So to prove this convergence we use an argument similar to one that is used to prove that sequence of random variables that converges in probability also converges in distribution (details omitted).",
        "This in turn establishes that s must be a classical ESS, and we thus obtain a converse to Theorem 5.2.",
        "This argument is made rigorous in Section A.2.",
        "The assumption on the degree of each vertex of Theorem 5.2 is rather strong.",
        "The following theorem relaxes this requirement and only necessitates that every graph have n1+γ edges, for some constant γ > 0, in which case it shows there will alway be at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness.",
        "A strategy that is an ESS in this weakened sense will essentially rule out stable, static sets of mutant invasions, but not more complex invasions.",
        "An example of more complex invasions are mutant sets that survive, but only by perpetually migrating through the graph under some natural evolutionary dynamics, akin to gliders in the well-known Game of Life [1].",
        "Theorem 5.3.",
        "Let F be any game, and let s be a classical ESS of F, and let t = s be a mutant strategy.",
        "For any graph family G = {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which |En| ≥ n1+γ (for any constant γ > 0), and any mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0 which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability , where t > > 0, the probability that there exists a mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness approaches 1 as n → ∞.",
        "Proof. (Sketch) The main idea behind the proof is to show that with high probability, over only the choice of mutants, there will be an incumbent-mutant edge in which both vertices have high degree.",
        "If their degree is high enough, we can show that close to an fraction of their neighbors are mutants, and thus their fitnesses are very close to what we expect them to be in the classical case.",
        "Since s is an ESS, the fitness of the incumbent will be higher than the mutant.",
        "We call an edge (i, j) ∈ En a g(n)-barbell if deg(i) ≥ g(n) and deg(j) ≥ g(n).",
        "Suppose Gn has at most h(n) edges that are g(n)-barbells.",
        "This means there are at least |En| − h(n) edges in which at least one vertex has degree at most g(n).",
        "We call these vertices light vertices.",
        "Let (n) be the number of light vertices in Gn.",
        "Observe that |En|−h(n) ≤ (n)g(n).",
        "This is because each light vertex is incident on at most g(n) edges.",
        "This gives us that |En| ≤ h(n) + (n)g(n) ≤ h(n) + ng(n).",
        "So if we choose h(n) and g(n) such that h(n) + ng(n) = o(n1+γ ), then |En| = o(n1+γ ).",
        "This contradicts the assumption that |En| = Ω(n1+γ ).",
        "Thus, subject to the above constraint on h(n) and g(n), Gn must contain at least h(n) edges that are g(n)-barbells.",
        "Now let Hn denote the subgraph induced by the barbell edges of Gn.",
        "Note that regardless of the structure of Gn, there is no reason that Hn should be connected.",
        "Thus, let m be the number of connected components of Hn, and let c1, c2, . . . , cm be the number of vertices in each of these connected components.",
        "Note that since Hn is an edge-induced subgraph we have ck ≥ 2 for all components k. Let us choose the mutant set by first flipping the vertices in Hn only.",
        "We now show that the probability, with respect to the random mutant set, that none of the components of Hn have an incumbent-mutant edge is exponentially small in n. Let An be the event that every component of Hn contains only mutants or only incumbents.",
        "Then algebraic manipulations can establish that Pr[An] = Πm k=1( ck + (1 − )ck ) ≤ (1 − )(1− β2 2 ) Pm k=1 ck 204 where β is a constant.",
        "Thus for sufficiently small the bound decreases exponentially with Pm k=1 ck.",
        "Furthermore, sincePm k=1 `ck 2 ´ ≥ h(n) (with equality achieved by making each component a clique), one can show that Pm k=1 ck ≥ p h(n).",
        "Thus, as long as h(n) → ∞ with n, the probability that all components are uniformly labeled will go to 0.",
        "Now assuming that there exists a non-uniformly labeled component, by construction that component contains an edge (i, j) where i is an incumbent and j is a mutant, that is a g(n)-barbell.",
        "We also assume that the h(n) vertices already labeled have been done so arbitrarily, but that the remaining g(n) − h(n) vertices neighboring i and j are labeled mutants independently with probability .",

        "LIMITATIONS OF STRONGER MODELS In this section we show that if one tried to strengthen the model described in Section 3 in two natural ways, one would not be able to prove results as strong as Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, which hold for every 2-player, symmetric game. 6.1 Stronger Contraction for the Mutant Set In Section 3 we alluded to the fact that we made certain design decisions in arriving at Definitions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.",

The proof of this theorem analyzes the limiting behavior of the mutant population as the size of the cliques in G tends to infinity.",
        "It also shows how the definition of ESS given in Section 5 recovers the classical definition of ESS.",

        "All we will need to prove this is that s is an ESS with respect to G = {Kn}∞ n=0, that is when each vertex has degree n − 1.",
        "As in Theorem A.1, since the graphs are cliques, if one incumbent has higher fitness than one mutant, then all incumbents have higher fitness than all mutants.",
        "Thus, the theorem below is also a converse to Theorem 5.3. (Recall that Theorem 5.3 uses a weaker notion of contraction that 206 requires only one incumbent to have higher fitness than one mutant.)",
        "Theorem A.2.",
        "Let F be any 2-player symmetric game, and suppose s is an incumbent strategy for F and t = s is a mutant strategy.",
        "Let G = {Kn}∞ n=0.",
        "If with probability 1 as n → ∞, s is an ESS for G and a mutant family M = {Mn}∞ n=0, which is determined by labeling each vertex a mutant with probability , where t > > 0, then s is a classical ESS of F. This proof also analyzes the limiting behavior of the mutant population as the size of the cliques in G tends to infinity.",
        "Since the mutants are chosen randomly we will use an argument similar to the proof that a sequence of random variables that converges in probability, also converge in distribution.",
        "In this case the sequence of random variables will be actual fraction of mutants in each Kn.",
        "Proof.",
        "Fix any value of , where n > > 0, and construct each Mn by labeling a vertex a mutant with probability .",
        "By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem A.1, if the actual number of mutants in Kn is denoted by nn, any mutant subset of size nn will result in all incumbents having fitness (1 − nn n−1 )F(s|s) + nn n−1 F(s|t), and in all mutants having fitness (1 − nn−1 n−1 )F(t|s) + nn−1 n−1 F(t|t).",
        "This implies lim n→∞ Pr(s is an ESS for Gn w.r.t. nn mutants) = 1 ⇒ lim n→∞ Pr „ (1 − nn n − 1 )F(s|s) + nn n − 1 F(s|t) > (1 − nn − 1 n − 1 )F(t|s) + nn − 1 n − 1 F(t|t) « = 1 ⇔ lim n→∞ Pr „ n > F(t|s) − F(s|s) F(s|t) − F(s|s) − F(t|t) + F(t|s) + F(s|s) − F(t|t) n « = 1 (3) By two simple applications of the Chernoff bound and an application of the union bound, one can show the sequence of random variables { n}∞ n=0 converges to in probability.",
        "Next, if we let Xn = − n, X = − , b = −F(s|s) + F(t|t), and a = − F (t|s)−F (s|s) F (s|t)−F (s|s)−F (t|t)+F (t|s) , by Theorem A.3 below, we get that limn→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) = Pr(X < a).",
        "Combining this with equation 3, Pr( > −a) = 1.",
        "The proof of the following theorem is very similar to the proof that a sequence of random variables that converges in probability, also converge in distribution.",
        "A good explanation of this can be found in [9], which is the basis for the argument below.",
        "Theorem A.3.",
        "If {Xn}∞ n=0 is a sequence of random variables that converge in probability to the random variable X, and a and b are constants, then limn→∞ Pr(Xn < a+b/n) = Pr(X < a).",
        "Proof.",
        "By Lemma A.1 (see below) we have the following two inequalities, Pr(X < a + b/n − τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ), Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + b/n + τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ).",
        "Combining these gives, Pr(X < a + b/n − τ) − Pr(|X − Xn| > τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + b/n + τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ).",
        "There exists an n0 such that for all n > n0, |b/n| < τ, so the following statement holds for all n > n0.",
        "Pr(X < a − 2τ) − Pr(|X − Xn| > τ) ≤ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) ≤ Pr(X < a + 2τ) + Pr(|X − Xn| > τ).",
        "Take the limn→∞ of both sides of both inequalities, and since Xn converges in probability to X, Pr(X < a − 2τ) ≤ lim n→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n) (4) ≤ Pr(X < a + 2τ). (5) Recall that X is a continuous random variable representing the fraction of mutants in an infinite sized graph.",
        "So if we let FX (a) = Pr(X < a), we see that FX (a) is a cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable, and is therefore continuous from the right.",
        "So lim τ↓0 FX (a − τ) = lim τ↓0 FX (a + τ) = FX (a).",
        "Thus if we take the limτ↓0 of inequalities 4 and 5 we get Pr(X < a) = lim n→∞ Pr(Xn < a + b/n).",

                "Intuitively, an ESS is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the population [17].",
                "To make this more precise, we describe the basic model of evolutionary game theory, in which the notion of an ESS resides.",
                "The standard model of evolutionary game theory considers an infinite population of organisms, each of which plays a strategy in a fixed, 2-player, symmetric game.",

                "If two organisms interact, one playing strategy s 200 and the other playing strategy t, the s-player earns a fitness of F(s|t) while the t-player earns a fitness of F(t|s).",

                "The strategy s is an ESS if the expected fitness of an organism playing s is higher than that of an organism playing t, for all t = s and all sufficiently small .",
                "Since an incumbent will meet another incumbent with probability 1 − and it will meet a mutant with probability , we can calculate the expected fitness of an incumbent, which is simply (1 − )F(s|s) + F(s|t).",

                "Thus, to violate the ESS property for G, one must witness a family of mutations M in which each Mn is an arbitrarily small but nonzero constant fraction of the population of Gn, but does not contract (i.e. every mutant set has a subset of linear size that survives all of its incumbent interactions).",
                "In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in the case where G is the family of complete graphs, in the limit of large n. We note that even in the classical model, small sets of mutants were allowed to have greater fitness than the incumbents, as long as the size of the set was o(n) [18].",
                "In the definition above there are three parameters: the game F, the graph family G and the mutation family M. Our main results will hold for any 2-player, symmetric game F. We will also study two rather general settings for G and M: that in which G is a family of random graphs and M is arbitrary, and that in which G is nearly arbitrary and M is randomly chosen.",
                "In both cases, we will see that, subject to conditions on degree or edge density (essentially forcing connectivity of G but not much more), for any 2-player, symmetric game, the ESS of the classical settings, and only those strategies, are always preserved.",

                "First, we consider a setting where the graphs are generated via the Gn,p model of Erd˝os and R´enyi [5].",
                "In this model, every pair of vertices are joined by an edge independently and with probability p (where p may depend on n).",
                "The mutant set, however, will be constructed adversarially (subject to the linear size constraint given by Definition 3.3).",
                "For these settings, we show that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS of that game, if and only if s is an ESS for {Gn,p}∞ n=0, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1, and any mutant family {Mn}∞ n=0, where each Mn has linear size.",
                "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",
                "It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.",
                "Thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge density.",
                "The second result is a kind of dual to the first, considering a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily (subject to conditions) but the mutant sets are chosen randomly.",
                "It states that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS for that game, if and only if s is an ESS for any {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0), and a family of mutant sets {Mn}∞ n=0, that is chosen randomly (that is, in which each organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability > 0).",
                "Thus, in this setting we again find that classical ESS are preserved subject to edge density restrictions.",

                "In Section A.1 we show that the definition given coincides with the classical one in the case where G is the family of complete graphs, in the limit of large n.

                "For these settings, we show that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS of that game, if and only if s is an ESS for {Gn,p}∞ n=0, where p = Ω(1/nc ) and 0 ≤ c < 1, and any mutant family {Mn}∞ n=0, where each Mn has linear size.",
                "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",
                "It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.",
                "Thus in some sense we examine the minimum plausible edge density.",
                "The second result is a kind of dual to the first, considering a setting where the graphs are chosen arbitrarily (subject to conditions) but the mutant sets are chosen randomly.",
                "It states that for any 2-player, symmetric game, s is a classical ESS for that game, if and only if s is an ESS for any {Gn = (Vn, En)}∞ n=0 in which for all v ∈ Vn, deg(v) = Ω(nγ ) (for any constant γ > 0), and a family of mutant sets {Mn}∞ n=0, that is chosen randomly (that is, in which each organism is labeled a mutant with constant probability > 0).",
                "Thus, in this setting we again find that classical ESS are preserved subject to edge density restrictions.",
                "Since the degree assumption is somewhat strong, we also prove another result which only assumes that |En| ≥ n1+γ , and shows that there must exist at least 1 mutant with an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness (as opposed to showing that all but o(n) mutants have an incumbent neighbor of higher fitness).",

                "The mutant set, however, will be constructed adversarially (subject to the linear size constraint given by Definition 3.3).",

                "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",
                "It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.",

                "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",
                "It is easy to convince oneself that once the graphs have only a linear number of edges, we are flirting with disconnectedness, and there may simply be large mutant sets that can survive in isolation due to the lack of any incumbent interactions in certain games.",

                "We note that under these settings, if we let c = 1 − γ for small γ > 0, the expected number of edges in Gn is n1+γ or larger - that is, just superlinear in the number of vertices and potentially far smaller than O(n2 ).",

Here we show that if s is an ESS with respect to G, then s is a classical ESS.",
