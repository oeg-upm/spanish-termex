Pham, James Harland School of CS&IT RMIT University GPO Box 2476V Melbourne, 3001, Australia {qupham,jah}@cs.rmit.edu.au ABSTRACT Interactions between agents in an open system such as the Internet require a significant degree of flexibility. A crucial aspect of the development of such methods is the notion of commitments, which provides a mechanism for coordinating interactive behaviors among agents. In this paper, we investigate an approach to model commitments with tight integration with protocol actions. This means that there is no need to have an explicit mapping from protocols actions to operations on commitments and an external mechanism to process and enforce commitments. We show how agents can reason about commitments and protocol actions to achieve the end results of protocols using a reasoning system based on temporal linear logic, which incorporates both temporal and resource-sensitive reasoning. We also discuss the application of this framework to scenarios such as online commerce.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Recently, software development has evolved toward the development of intelligent, interconnected systems working in a distributed manner. The agent paradigm has become well suited as a design metaphor to deal with complex systems comprising many components each having their own thread of control and purposes and involved in dynamic and complex interactions. In multi-agent environments, agents often need to interact with each other to fulfill their goals. Protocols are used to regulate interactions. In traditional approaches to protocol specification, like those using Finite State Machines or Petri Nets, protocols are often predetermined legal sequences of interactive behaviors. In frequently changing environments such as the Internet, such fixed sequences can quickly become outdated and are prone to failure. Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly. To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints. Also, agents should be allowed to adjust their interactive actions to take advantages of opportunities or handle exceptions that arise during interaction. For example, consider the scenario below for online sales. A merchant Mer has 200 cricket bats available for sale with a unit price of 10 dollars. A customer Cus has $50. Cus has a goal of obtaining from Mer a cricket bat at some time. There are two options for Cus to pay. If Cus uses credit payment, Mer needs a bank Ebank to check Cuss credit. If Cuss credit is approved, Ebank will arrange the credit payment. Otherwise, Cus may then take the option to pay via PayPal. The interaction ends when goods are delivered and payment is arranged. A flexible approach to this example should include several features. Firstly, the payment method used by Cus should be at Cuss own choice and have the property that if Cuss credit check results in a disapproval, this exception should also be handled automatically by Cuss switching to PayPal. Secondly, there should be no unnecessary constraint on the order in which actions are performed, such as which of making payments and sending the cricket bat should come first. Thirdly, choosing a sequence of interactive actions should be based on reasoning about the intrinsic meanings of protocol actions, which are based on the notion of commitment, i.e. which refers to a strong promise to other agent(s) to undertake some courses of action. Current approaches [11, 12, 10, 1] to achieve flexibilities using the notion of commitment make use of an abstract layer of commitments. However, in these approaches, a mapping from protocol actions onto operations on commitments 124 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS as well as handling and enforcement mechanisms of commitments must be externally provided. Execution of protocol actions also requires concurrent execution of operations on related commitments. As a result, the overhead of processing the commitment layer makes specification and execution of protocols more complicated and error prone. There is also a lack of a logic to naturally express aspects of resources, internal and external choices as well as time of protocols. Rather than creating another layer of commitment outside protocol actions, we try to achieve a modeling of commitments that is integrated with protocol actions. Both commitments and protocol actions can then be reasoned about in one consistent system. In order to achieve that, we specify protocols in a declarative manner, i.e. what is to be achieved rather then how agents should interact. A key to this is using logic. Temporal logic, in particular, is suitable for describing and reasoning about temporal constraints while linear logic [3] is quite suitable for modeling resources. We suggest using a combination of linear logic and temporal logic to construct a commitment based interaction framework which allows both temporal and resource-related reasoning for interaction protocols. This provides a natural manipulation and reasoning mechanism as well as internal enforcement mechanisms for commitments based on proof search. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background material of linear logic, temporal linear logic and commitments. Section 3 introduces our modeling framework and specification of protocols. Section 4 discusses how our framework can be used for an example of online sale interactions between a merchant, a bank and a customer. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of using our framework to model interaction protocols and achieve flexibility in Section 5. Section 6 presents our conclusions and items of further work. 2. BACKGROUND In order to increase the agents autonomy over their interactive behaviors, protocols should be specified in terms of what is to be achieved rather than how the agents should act. In other words, protocols should be specified in a declarative manner. Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems. Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes. It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8]. In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created. In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome. If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar. This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true). In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources. In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar. Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives. A ⊗ (multiplicative conjunction) A, means that one has two As at the same time, which is different from A ∧ A = A. Hence, ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion. A ℘ (multiplicative disjunction) B, means that if not A then B or vice versa but not both A and B. The ability to specify choices via the additive connectives is a particularly useful feature of linear logic. A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both. A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which. As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice). For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the clients, we use A ⊕ B. In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made. Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations. Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5]. In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints. Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2]. Temporal logic can be used for specification and verification of concurrent and reactive programs [2]. Temporal Linear Logic (TLL) [6] is the result of introducing temporal logic into linear logic and hence is resourceconscious as well as deals with time. The temporal operators used are (next), (anytime), and (sometime) [6]. Formulas with no temporal operators can be considered as being available only at present. Adding to a formula A, i.e. A, means that A can be used only at the next time and exactly once. Similarly, A means that A can be used at any time and exactly once. A means that A can be used once at some time. Though both and refer to a point in time, the choice of which time is different. Regarding , the choice is an internal choice, as appropriate to ones own capability. With , the choice is externally decided by others. 2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction. Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11]. In particular, persistence in commitments introduces into agents consideration a certain level of predictability of other agents actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 125 resources sharing [7]. Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11]. Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved. From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined. Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal computations [11]. Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments. A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state. Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others. The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment. Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3. MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents. We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles. Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments. Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment. Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction. Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning. This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment. Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context. In a nutshell, services are what agents are capable of providing to other agents. Commitments can then be seen to arise from combinations of services, i.e. an agents capabiliA unit of consumable resources is modeled as a proposition in linear logic. Numeric figures can be used to abbreviate a multiplicative conjunction of the same instances. For example, 2 dollar = dollar ⊗ dollar. Moreover, such 3 A is a shorthand for A. In order to address the dynamic manipulation of resources, we also include information about the location and ownership in the encoding of resources to address the relocation and changes in possession of resources during agent interaction. That resource A is located at agent α and owned by agent β is expressed via a shorthand notation as A@αβ , which is treated as a logic proposition in our framework. This notation can be later extended to a more complex logic construct to reason about changes in location and ownership. In our running example, a cricket bat cricket b being located at and owned by agent Mer is denoted as cricket b@M .M After a successful sale to the agent customer Cus, the cricket bat will be relocated to and owned by agent Cus. The formula cricket b@CC will replace the formula cricket b@MM to reflect the changes. Our treatment of unlimited resources is to model it as a number σ of copies of the resources formula such that the number σ is chosen to be extremely large, relative to the context. For instance, to indicate that the merchant Mer can issue an unlimited number of sale quotes at any time, we use σ sale quote@M .M Declaration of actions is also modeled in a similar manner as of resources. The capabilities of agents refer to producing, consuming, relocating and changing ownership of resources. Capabilities are represented by describing the state before and after performing them. The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after. The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after. Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ. To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars. The conditions before are 10 dollars and a payment method from agent Cus: 10$@CC ⊗ pay m@C . Given these, by applying theC capability, Mer will gain 10 dollars (10$@MM ) and com⊥ ) so that CusM mit to providing a cricket bat (cricket b@M will get a cricket bat (cricket b@CC ). Together, the capability is encoded as 10$@C ⊗ pay m@C 10$@MC C ⊗ cricket b@C M ⊗ ties. Hence, our approach shifts specifying a set of protocol commitments to specifying sets of pre-commitments as capabilities for each agent. Commitments are then can be ⊥ M cricket b@M .C 3.2 Modeling commitmentsreasoned about and manipulated by the same logic mechanism as is used for the agents actions, resources and goals, which greatly simplifies the system. Our framework uses TLL as a means of specifying interaction protocols. We encode various concepts such as resource, capability and commitment in TLL. The symmetry between a formula and its negation in TLL is explored as a way to model resources and commitments. We then discuss the central role of pre-commitments, and how they are specified at each participating agent. It then remains for agents to reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments, We discuss the modeling of various types of commitments, their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms. Due to duality in linear logic, positive formulas can be regarded as formulas in supply and negative formulas can be regarded as formulas in demand. Hence, we take an approach of modeling non-conditional or base commitments as negative formulas. In particular, by turning a formula into its negative form, a base commitment to derive the resources or carry out the actions associated with the formula is created. In the above example, a commitment of agent Mer to ⊥ M .which are subsequently discharged. provide a cricket bat (cricket b@MM ) is cricket b@M A base commitment is fulfilled (discharged) whenever the 3.1 Modeling resources and capabilities committing agent successfully brings about the respective 126 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) resources or carries out the actions as required by the commitment. In TLL modeling, this means that the corresponding positive formula is derived. Resolution of commitments can then be naturally carried out by inference in TLL. For example, cricket b@M will fulfil the commit-M ment cricket b@M⊥ and both formulas are automaticallyM removed as cricket b@MM ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ .M ⊥ Under a further assumption that agents are expected to resolve all formulas in demand (removing negative formulas), this creates a driving pressure on agents to resolve base commitments. This pressure then becomes a natural and internal enforcement mechanism for base commitments. A commitment with conditions (or conditional commitment) can be modeled by connecting the conditions to base commitments via a linear implication. A general form is Γ Δ where Γ is the condition part and Δ includes base commitments. If the condition Γ is derived, by consuming Γ, the linear implication will ensure that Δ results, which means the base commitments in Δ become effective. If the conditions can not be achieved, the linear implication can not be applied and hence commitment part in the conditional commitment is still inactive. In our approach, conditional commitments are specified in their potential form as pre-commitments of participating agents. Pre-commitments are negotiated among agents via proposals and upon being accepted, will form conditional commitments among the engaged agents. Conditional commitments are interpreted as that the condition Γ is required of the proposed agent and the commitment part Δ is the responsibility of the owner (proposing) agent. Indeed, such interpretation and the encoding of realize the notion of a conditional commitment that owner agent is willing to commit to deriving Δ given the proposed agent satisfies the conditions Γ. Conditional commitments, pre-commitments and capabilities all have similar encodings. However, their differences lie in the phases of commitment that they are in. Capabilities are used internally by the owner agent and do not involve any commitment. Pre-commitments can be regarded as capabilities intended for forming conditional commitments. Upon being accepted, pre-commitments will turn into conditional commitments and bring the two engaged agents into a commitment phase. As an example, consider that Mer has a capability of selling cricket bats: (10$@CC ⊗pay m@CC ) (10$@M ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ ⊗ cricket b@CC ). When MerM M proposes its capability to Cus, the capability acts as a precommitment. When the proposal gets accepted, that precommitment will turn into a conditional commitment in which Mer commits to fulfilling the base commitment cricket b@M⊥ (which leads to having cricket b@CC ) uponM the condition that Cus derives 10$@CC ⊗pay m@C (whichC leads to having 10$@MM ). Breakable commitments which are in place to provide agents with the desired flexibility to remove itself from its commitments (cancel commitments) are also modeled naturally in our framework. A base commitment Com⊥ is turned into a breakable base commitment (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ . The extra token cond reflects the agents internal deliberation about when the commitment to derive Com is broken. Once cond is produced, due to the logic deduction cond ⊗ (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ ⊥, the commitment (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ is removed, and hence breaking the commitment of deriving Com. Moreover, a breakable conditional commitment is modeled as A (1 B), instead of A B. When the condition A is provided, the linear implication brings about (1 B) and it is now up to the owner agents internal choice whether 1 or B is resulted. If the agent chooses 1, which practically means nothing is derived, then the conditional commitment is deliberately broken. 3.3 Protocol Construction Given the modeling of various interaction concepts like resource, action, capability, and commitment, we will discuss how protocols can be specified. In our framework, each agent is encoded with the resources, actions, capabilities, pre-commitments, any pending commitments that it has. Pre-commitments, which stem from services the agents are capable of providing, are designated to be fair exchanges. In a pre-commitment, all the requirements of the other party are put in the condition part and all the effects to be provided by the owner agent are put on the commitment part to make up a trade-off. Such a design allows agents to freely propose pre-commitments to any interested parties. An example of pre-commitments is that of an agent Merchant regarding a sale of a cricket bat: [10$@CC ⊗pay m@C 10 $@MM ⊗ cricket b@CC ⊗cricket b@M⊥ M ]. The condition is the requirement that the customer agent provides 10 dollars, which is assumed to be the price of a cricket bat, via a payment method. The exchange is the cricket bat for the customer ( cricket b@CC ) and hence is fair to the merchant. Protocols are specified in terms of sets of pre-commitments at participating agents. Given some initial interaction commitments, a protocol emerges as agents are reasoning about which pre-commitments to offer and accept in order to fulfill these commitments. Given a such a protocol specification, we then discuss how interaction might take place. An interaction can start with a request or a proposal. When an agent can not achieve some commitments by itself, it can make a request of them or propose a relevant pre-commitment to an appropriate agent to fulfill them. The choice of which pre-commitments depends on if such pre-commitments can produce the formulas to fulfill the agents pending commitments. When an agent receives a request, it searches for precommitments that can together produce the required formulas of the requests. Those pre-commitments found will be used as proposals to the requesting agents. Otherwise, a failure notice will be returned. When a proposal is received, the recipient agent also performs a search with the inclusion of the proposal for a proof of those formulas that can resolve its commitments. If the search result is positive, the proposal is accepted and becomes a commitment. The recipient then attempts to fulfill conditions of the commitments. Otherwise, the proposal is refused and no commitment is formed. Throughout the interaction, proof search has played a vital role in protocol construction. Proof search reveals that some commitments can not be resolved locally or some pre-commitments can be used to resolve pending commitments, which prompts the agent to make a request or proposal respectively. Proof search also determines which precommitments are relevant to fulfillment of a request, which helps agents to decide which pre-commitments to propose to answer the request. Moreover, whether a received proposal C The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 127 is relevant to any pending commitments or not is also determined by a search for proof of these commitments with an inclusion of the proposal. Conditions of proposals can be resolved by proof search as it links them with the agents current resources and capabilities as well as any relevant precommitments. Therefore, it can be seen that proof search performed by participating agents can link up their respective pre-commitments and turn them into commitments as appropriate, which give rise to protocol formation. We will demonstrate this via our running example in section 4. 3.4 Interactive Messages Agents interact by sending messages. We address agent interaction in a simple model which contains messages of type requests, proposals, acceptance, refusal and failure notice. We denote Source to Destination: prior to each message to indicate the source and destination of the message. For example Cust to Mer: denotes that the message is sent from agent Cust to agent Mer. Request messages start with the key word REQUEST: REQUEST + formula. Formulas in request messages are of commitments. Proposal messages are preceded with PROPOSE. Formulas are of capabilities. For example, α to β: PROPOSE Γ Δ is a proposal from agent α to agent β. There are messages that agents use to response to a proposal. Agents can indicate an acceptance: ACCEPT, or a refusal: REFUSE. To notice a failure in fulfilling a request or proposal, agents reply with that request or proposal message appended with FAIL. 3.5 Generating Interactions As we have seen, temporal linear logic provides an elegant means for encoding the various concepts of agent interaction in a commitment based specification framework. Appropriate interaction is generated as agents negotiate their specified pre-commitments to fulfill their goals. The association among pre-commitments at participating agents and the monitoring of commitments to ensure that all are discharged are performed by proof search. In the next section, we will demonstrate how specification and generation of interactions in our framework might work. 4. EXAMPLE We return to the online sales scenario introduced in Section 1. 4.1 Specifying Protocol We design a set of pre-commitments and capabilities to implement the above scenario. For simplicity, we refer to them as rules. Rules at agent Mer Mer has available at any time 200 cricket bats for sale and can issue sale quotes at any time: 200 cricket b@M ⊗ σ sale quote@M .M M Rule 1: Mer commits to offering a cricket bat (cricket b@M⊥ M ) to Cus ( cricket b@CC ) if Cus pays 10 dollars (10$@CC ) either via Paypal or credit card. The choice is at Cus. σ [10$@C ⊗ (Paypal paid@M ⊕ credit paid@MM )C M 10 $@M ⊗ cricket b@C ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ M C M ] Rule 2: If EBank carries out the credit payment to Mer then the requirement of credit payment at Mer is fulfilled: σ [credit paym@M credit paid@MM ]B Rule 3: If Ebank informs Mer of its disapproval of Cuss credit then Mer will also let Cus know. σ [credit not appr@M credit not appr@CB ]B Rules at agent Ebank Rule 4: Upon receiving a sale quote from Mer, at the next time point, Ebank commits to either informing Mer that Cuss credit is not approved ( credit not appr@MB ) or arranging a credit payment to Mer ( credit paym@MB ). The decision is dependent on the credibility of Cus and hence is external (⊕) to Ebank and Mer: σ [sale quote@M ( credit not appr@MB ) ⊕M credit paym@MB ] Rules at agent Cus Cus has an amount of 50 dollars available at any time, can be used for credit payment or cash payment: $50@C. Cus has a commitment of obtaining a cricket bat at some time: [ cricket b@CC ]⊥ . Rule 5: Cus will pay Mer via Paypal if there is an indication from EBank that Cuss credit is not approved: σ [credit not appr@C Paypal paid@MM ]B 4.2 Description of the interaction Cus requests from Mer a cricket bat at some time. Mer replies with a proposal in which each cricket bat costs 10 dollars. Cus needs to prepare 10 dollars and payment can be made by credit or via Paypal. Assuming that Cus only pays via Paypal if credit payment fails, Cus will let Mer charges by credit. Mer will then ask EBank to arrange a credit payment. EBank proposes that Mer gives a quote of sale and depending on Cuss credibility, at the next time point, either credit payment will be arranged or a disapproval of Cuss credit will be informed. Mer accepts and fulfills the conditions. If the first case happens, credit payment is done. If the second case happens, credit payment is failed, Cus may back track to take the option paying via Paypal. Once payment is arranged, Mer will apply its original proposal to satisfy the Cuss request of a cricket bat and hence removing one cricket bat and adding 10 dollars into its set of resources. 4.3 Interaction 1. Cus can not fulfill its commitment of [ (cricket b@CC )]⊥ and hence, makes a request to Merchant: C to M: REQUEST [ cricket b@CC ]⊥ 2. To meet the request, Mer searches for applicable rules. One applications of rule 1 can derive cricket b@C and cricket b@C cricket b@C . Mer will propose rule 1C C at a time instance n1 to Cus as a pre-commitment. M to C: PROPOSE n1 [10$@C ⊗ (Paypal paid@M ⊕ credit paid@MM )C M 10 $@M ⊗ cricket b@C ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ M ]M C With similar analysis, Cus determines that given the conC 128 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ditions can be satisfied, the proposals can help to derive its request. Hence, C to M: ACCEPT Cus analyzes the conditions of the accepted proposal by proof search. n110$@CC ; n1Paypal paid@M or n1credit paid@MM ; -(*)-M n110$@C ⊗ ( n1Paypal paid@M ⊕ n1credit paid@MM )C M n1(10$@C ⊗ (Paypal paid@M ⊕ credit paid@MM ))C M From (*), one way to satisfy the conditions is for Cus to derive, at the next n1 time points, 10 dollars ( n1 10$@CC ); and to choose paying via Paypal ( n1 Paypal paid@MM ) OR by credit payment ( n1 credit paid@MM ). 3. Deriving n1 10$@C : as Cus has 50 dollars, it canC make use of 10 dollars: 10 $@C 10$@C n1 10$@C .C C C There are two options for payment method, the choice is at agent Cus. We assume that Cus prefers credit payment. 4. Deriving n1 credit paid@M : Cus can not deriveM this formula by itself, hence, it will make a request to Mer: C to M: REQUEST [ n1 credit paid@MM ]⊥ . 5. Rule 2 at Mer is applicable but Mer can not derive its condition ( n1 credit paym@MB ). Hence, Mer will further make a request to EBank. M to E: REQUEST [ n1 credit paym@MB ]⊥ Ebank searches and finds rule 4 applicable. Because credit paym@M will be available one time point after theB rules application time, Ebank proposes to Mer an instance of rule 4 at the next n1-1 time points. 6. B to M: PROPOSE n1−1 [quote@MM ( credit not appr@M ⊕ credit paym@MB )]B With similar analysis, Mer accepts the proposal. M to B: ACCEPT The rule condition is fulfilled by Mer as quote@MM n1−1 quote@M . Hence, Ebank then applies the proposalM to derive: n1−1 ( credit not appr@M ⊕ credit paym@MB ).B ⊕ indicates the choice is external to both agents. There are two cases, Cuss credit is approved or disapproved. For simplicity, we show only the case where Cuss credit is approved. At the next (n1-1) time point, n1−1 ( credit not appr@MB ⊕ credit paym@MB ) becomes n1−1 credit paym@M n1 credit paym@M .B B As a result, at the next n1 time points, Ebank will arrange the credit payment. 7. Mer fulfills Cuss initial request. When any of n1 Paypal paid@M (if Cus pays via Pay-M pal) or n1 credit paid@M (if Cus pays by credit card)M is derived, n1 (credit paym@M ⊕ Paypal paid@MM ) isM also derived, hence the payment method is arranged. Together with the other condition 10$@C being satisfied,C this allows the initial proposal to be applied by Mer to derive n1 cricket b@CC and a commitment of n1 cricket b@M⊥ M for Mer, which is also resolved by the resource cricket b@MM available at Mer. Any values of n1 such that n1 − 1 ≥ 0 ⇔ n1 ≥ 1 will allow Mer to fulfill Cuss initial request of [ cricket b@CC ]⊥ . The interaction ends as all commitments are resolved. 4.4 Flexibility The desired flexibility has been achieved in the example. It is Cuss own decision to proceed with the preferred payment method. Also, non-determinism that whether Cuss credit is disapproved or credit payment is made to Mer is faithfully represented. If an exception happens that Cuss credit is not approved, credit not appr@C is produced andB Cus can backtrack to paying via Paypal. Rule 5 will then be utilized to allow Cus to handle the exception by paying via Paypal. Moreover, in order to specify that making payments and sending cricket bats can be in any order, we can add in front of payment method in rule 1 as follows: σ [10$@C ⊗ (Paypal paid@M ⊕ credit paid@MM )C M 10 $@M ⊗ cricket b@C ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ M ].M C This addition in the condition of the rule means that the time of payment can be any time up to Cuss choice, as long as Cus pays and hence, the time order between making payments and sending goods becomes flexible. 5. ENCODING ISSUES 5.1 Advantages of TLL framework Our TLL framework has demonstrated natural and expressive specification of agent interaction protocols. Linear implication ( ) expresses causal relationship, which makes it natural to model a removal or a consumption, especially of resources, together with its consequences. Hence, in our framework, resource transformation is modeled as a linear implication of the consumed resources to the produced resources. Resource relocation is modeled as a linear implication from a resource at one agent to that resource at the other agent. Linear implication also ensures that fulfillment of the conditions of a conditional commitment will cause the commitments to happen. Moreover, state updates of agents are resulted from a linear implication from the old state to the current state. Temporal operators ( , and ) and their combinations help to specify the time of actions, of resource availability and express the time order of events. Particularly, precise time points are described by the use of operator or multiple copies of it. Based on this ability to specify correct time points for actions or events, time order or sequencing of them can also be captured. Also, a sense of duration is simulated by spreading copies of the resources or actions formulas across multiple adjacent time points. Moreover, uncertainty in time can represented and reasoned about by the use of and and their combinations with . can be used to express outer non-determinism while expresses inner non-determinism. These time properties of resources, actions and events are correctly respected through out the agent reasoning process based on sequent calculus rules. Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4]. However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework. Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas. The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments. Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task. Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥). The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments. Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points. Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain. Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them. Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions. Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments. Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches. On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments. This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol. Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents. To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas. This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments. In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences. It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise. Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations. Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas. Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed. Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes. Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols. Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles. Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output. Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments. As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully. One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . . A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly. Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL. Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have. Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict. Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic. Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols. In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time. Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions. In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes. The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment. Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions. Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues. These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources. Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly. In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement. Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations. This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol. Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone. Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies. Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL. Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction. Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety. Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.

    "original_translation": "Lógica lineal temporal como base para las interacciones de agentes flexibles Duc Q. Pham, James Harland School of CS & IT RMIT University GPO Box 2476V Melbourne, 3001, Australia {Qupham, Jah}@Cs.Rmit.edu.au Interacciones abstractas entre agentes en una abiertaEl sistema como Internet requiere un grado significativo de flexibilidad. Un aspecto crucial del desarrollo de tales métodos es la noción de compromisos, que proporciona un mecanismo para coordinar los comportamientos interactivos entre los agentes. En este documento, investigamos un enfoque para modelar compromisos con una estrecha integración con acciones de protocolo. Esto significa que no hay necesidad de tener una asignación explícita de las acciones de los protocolos a las operaciones de los compromisos y un mecanismo externo para procesar y hacer cumplir los compromisos. Mostramos cómo los agentes pueden razonar sobre compromisos y acciones de protocolo para lograr los resultados finales de los protocolos utilizando un sistema de razonamiento basado en la lógica lineal temporal, que incorpora un razonamiento temporal y sensible a los recursos. También discutimos la aplicación de este marco a escenarios como el comercio en línea. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial distribuida]: agentes inteligentes;D.3.2 [Lenguajes de programación]: Clasificaciones de lenguaje Teoría de los términos generales, diseño 1. Introducción y motivación Recientemente, el desarrollo de software ha evolucionado hacia el desarrollo de sistemas inteligentes e interconectados que trabajan de manera distribuida. El paradigma del agente se ha vuelto muy adecuado como una metáfora de diseño para tratar sistemas complejos que comprenden muchos componentes, cada uno con su propio hilo de control y propósitos e involucrado en interacciones dinámicas y complejas. En entornos de múltiples agentes, los agentes a menudo necesitan interactuar entre sí para cumplir con sus objetivos. Los protocolos se utilizan para regular las interacciones. En los enfoques tradicionales para la especificación del protocolo, como aquellos que usan máquinas estatales finitas o redes de Petri, los protocolos a menudo son secuencias legales predeterminadas de comportamientos interactivos. En entornos que cambian con frecuencia, como Internet, tales secuencias fijas pueden quedarse desactualizadas y son propensas a la falla. Por lo tanto, los agentes deben adaptar sus comportamientos interactivos para tener éxito y las interacciones entre los agentes no deben construirse rígidamente. Para lograr la flexibilidad, como se caracteriza por Yolum y Singh en [11], los protocolos de interacción deben garantizar que los agentes tengan autonomía sobre sus comportamientos interactivos y estar libres de cualquier restricción innecesaria. Además, se debe permitir a los agentes ajustar sus acciones interactivas para aprovechar las oportunidades o manejar excepciones que surgen durante la interacción. Por ejemplo, considere el escenario a continuación para las ventas en línea. Un comerciante Mer tiene 200 murciélagos de cricket disponibles para la venta con un precio unitario de 10 dólares. Un cliente CU tiene $ 50. CUS tiene el objetivo de obtener de Mer un bate de cricket en algún momento. Hay dos opciones para que CUS pague. Si el cliente usa el pago de crédito, MER necesita un Bank Ebank para verificar el crédito CUSS. Si se aprueba CUSS Credit, Ebank organizará el pago de crédito. De lo contrario, CUS puede tomar la opción de pagar a través de PayPal. La interacción termina cuando se entregan los bienes y se organiza el pago. Un enfoque flexible para este ejemplo debe incluir varias características. En primer lugar, el método de pago utilizado por CUS debe estar en Cuss Own Choice y tener la propiedad de que si CUSS Credit Check da como resultado una desaprobación, esta excepción también debe manejarse automáticamente cambiando a PayPal. En segundo lugar, no debe haber una restricción innecesaria en el orden en que se realizan las acciones, como cuál de hacer pagos y enviar el bate de cricket debería ser lo primero. En tercer lugar, elegir una secuencia de acciones interactivas debe basarse en el razonamiento sobre los significados intrínsecos de las acciones de protocolo, que se basan en la noción de compromiso, es decir, que se refiere a una fuerte promesa a otros agentes para llevar a cabo algunos cursos de acción. Los enfoques actuales [11, 12, 10, 1] para lograr flexibilidades utilizando la noción de compromiso hacen uso de una capa abstracta de compromisos. Sin embargo, en estos enfoques, un mapeo de las acciones de protocolo a las operaciones de los compromisos 124 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) C 2007 Ifaamas, así como los mecanismos de manejo y cumplimiento de los compromisos deben ser proporcionados externamente. La ejecución de acciones de protocolo también requiere la ejecución concurrente de las operaciones en compromisos relacionados. Como resultado, la sobrecarga del procesamiento de la capa de compromiso hace que la especificación y la ejecución de los protocolos sean más complicados y propensos a errores. También hay una falta de una lógica para expresar naturalmente aspectos de los recursos, las opciones internas y externas, así como el tiempo de los protocolos. En lugar de crear otra capa de compromiso fuera de las acciones de protocolo, tratamos de lograr un modelado de compromisos integrados con acciones de protocolo. Tanto los compromisos como las acciones de protocolo pueden razonarse en un sistema consistente. Para lograr eso, especificamos protocolos de manera declarativa, es decir, lo que debe lograrse en lugar de cómo deben interactuar los agentes. Una clave para esto es usar lógica. La lógica temporal, en particular, es adecuada para describir y razonar sobre restricciones temporales, mientras que la lógica lineal [3] es bastante adecuada para modelar recursos. Sugerimos usar una combinación de lógica lineal y lógica temporal para construir un marco de interacción basado en el compromiso que permita un razonamiento temporal y relacionado con los recursos para los protocolos de interacción. Esto proporciona una manipulación natural y un mecanismo de razonamiento, así como mecanismos de aplicación interna para compromisos basados en la búsqueda de pruebas. Este artículo está organizado de la siguiente forma: La Sección 2 analiza el material de fondo de la lógica lineal, la lógica lineal temporal y los compromisos. La Sección 3 presenta nuestro marco de modelado y especificación de protocolos. La Sección 4 analiza cómo nuestro marco se puede utilizar para un ejemplo de interacciones de venta en línea entre un comerciante, un banco y un cliente. Luego discutimos las ventajas y limitaciones del uso de nuestro marco para modelar los protocolos de interacción y logramos flexibilidad en la Sección 5. La Sección 6 presenta nuestras conclusiones y elementos de trabajo adicional.2. Antecedentes Para aumentar la autonomía de los agentes sobre sus comportamientos interactivos, los protocolos deben especificarse en términos de lo que debe lograrse en lugar de cómo deben actuar los agentes. En otras palabras, los protocolos deben especificarse de manera declarativa. El uso de la lógica es fundamental para este proceso de especificación.2.1 La lógica de lógica lineal se ha utilizado como formalismo para modelar y razonar sobre los sistemas de agentes. La lógica lineal [3] es conocida por modelar recursos y actualizar procesos. Se ha considerado en los sistemas de agentes para apoyar la negociación y la planificación de los agentes mediante búsqueda de prueba [5, 8]. En la vida real, se consumen recursos y se crean nuevos recursos. Sin embargo, en la lógica como la lógica clásica o temporal, una asignación directa de recursos en fórmulas es problemático. Si modelamos recursos como A como un dólar y B como una barra de chocolate, entonces A ⇒ B en la lógica clásica se lee como de un dólar, podemos obtener una barra de chocolate. Esto causa problemas ya que la implicación permite obtener una barra de chocolate (B es cierto) mientras se conserva un dólar (A sigue siendo cierto). Para resolver tales problemas de mapeo de recursos - fórmula, Girard propuso las restricciones en las que se utilizarán las fórmulas exactamente una vez y ya no se puede agregar o eliminar libremente en derivaciones y, por lo tanto, tratar las fórmulas lógicas lineales como recursos. Sin embargo, en lógica lineal, una implicación lineal A B permite que A se elimine A después de derivar B, lo que significa que el dólar se ha ido después de usar un dólar para comprar una barra de chocolate. La conjunción clásica (y) y la disyunción (o) se refundan en diferentes usos de los contextos, multiplicativos como combinados y aditivos como compartir para crear cuatro conectivos. A ⊗ (conjunción multiplicativa) A, significa que uno tiene dos como al mismo tiempo, que es diferente de a ∧ a = A. Por lo tanto, ⊗ permite una expresión natural de proporción. A ℘ (disyunción multiplicativa) B, significa que, si no es, entonces B o viceversa pero no a A y B. La capacidad de especificar opciones a través de los conectivos aditivos es una característica particularmente útil de la lógica lineal. A (conjunción aditiva) B, representa una propia opción, ya sea de A o B pero no ambas. A ⊕ (disyunción aditiva) B, significa la posibilidad de A o B, pero no sabemos cuál. Como se observó en [5], y ⊕ permiten que se aclaren las opciones entre las opciones internas (las propias) y las opciones externas (otros opciones). Por ejemplo, para especificar que la elección de los lugares A o B para la entrega de bienes es nuestra como proveedor, usamos una B, o es los clientes, usamos un ⊕ B. En los sistemas de agentes, esta dualidad entre las elecciones internas y externas se manifiesta por un agente que tiene el poder de elegir entre alternativas y la otra que tiene que reaccionar ante cualquier elección que se haga. Además, durante la interacción, la capacidad de hacer coincidir el consumo y el suministro de recursos entre los agentes puede simplificar la especificación de asignaciones de recursos. La lógica lineal es un mecanismo natural para proporcionar esta capacidad [5]. Además, se enfatiza en [8] que la lógica lineal se utiliza para modelar los estados de los agentes como conjuntos de recursos consumibles y, en particular, la implicación lineal se utiliza para modelar las transiciones entre los estados y las capacidades de los agentes.2.2 Lógica lineal temporal Si bien la lógica lineal proporciona ventajas al modelado y el razonamiento sobre los recursos, no trata naturalmente con las limitaciones de tiempo. La lógica temporal, por otro lado, es un sistema formal que aborda la descripción y el razonamiento sobre los cambios de los valores de verdad de las expresiones lógicas a lo largo del tiempo [2]. La lógica temporal se puede utilizar para la especificación y verificación de programas concurrentes y reactivos [2]. La lógica lineal temporal (TLL) [6] es el resultado de la introducción de la lógica temporal en la lógica lineal y, por lo tanto, es recursos recursos y se ocupa del tiempo. Los operadores temporales utilizados son (siguiente), (en cualquier momento) y (en algún momento) [6]. Las fórmulas sin operadores temporales pueden considerarse como disponibles solo en la actualidad. Además de una fórmula A, es decir, A, significa que A solo se puede usar en la próxima vez y exactamente una vez. Del mismo modo, un medio que A se puede usar en cualquier momento y exactamente una vez. Un medio que A se puede usar una vez en algún momento. Aunque ambos y se refieren a un punto en el tiempo, la elección del que es diferente es diferente. Con respecto, la elección es una elección interna, según corresponda a la capacidad propia. Con, la elección es decidida externamente por otros.2.3 Compromiso El concepto de compromiso social ha sido reconocido como fundamental para la interacción de los agentes. De hecho, el compromiso social proporciona significados intrínsecos de las acciones de protocolo y los estados [11]. En particular, la persistencia en los compromisos introduce en la consideración de los agentes un cierto nivel de previsibilidad de las acciones de otros agentes, lo cual es importante cuando los agentes se ocupan de cuestiones de interdependencias, limitaciones globales o el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 125 recursos compartiendo [7]. Los enfoques basados en compromiso asocian las acciones de los protocolos con operaciones sobre compromisos y estados de protocolo con el conjunto de compromisos efectivos [11]. Completar el protocolo se realiza a través del razonamiento de medios en las operaciones de compromiso para llevar al estado actual a los estados finales donde se resuelven todos los compromisos. A partir de entonces, se determinan las secuencias legales correspondientes de acciones interactivas. Por lo tanto, los enfoques mejoran sistemáticamente una variedad de cálculos legales [11]. Los compromisos pueden reducirse a una forma más fundamental conocida como pre-compromisos. Un compromiso previo aquí se refiere a un compromiso potencial que especifica lo que el agente del propietario está dispuesto a cometer [4], como realizar algunas acciones o lograr un estado en particular. Los agentes pueden negociar sobre compromisos previos al enviar propuestas de ellas a otros. Los otros pueden responder de acuerdo o en desacuerdo con la propuesta o proponiendo otro compromiso previo. Una vez que se acuerda un precommito, se convierte en un compromiso y el proceso pasa de la fase de negociación a la fase de compromiso, en la que los agentes actúan para cumplir con sus compromisos.3. Los protocolos de interacciones de agentes de modelado normalmente se ven externos a los agentes y son esencialmente un conjunto de compromisos impuestos externamente a los agentes participantes. Tomamos una visión interna de los protocolos, es decir, desde la opinión de los agentes participantes al poner la especificación de compromisos localmente en los agentes respectivos de acuerdo con sus roles. Tal enfoque permite a los agentes administrar sus propios compromisos de protocolo. De hecho, los agentes ya no aceptan y siguen un conjunto dado de compromisos, sino que pueden razonar qué compromisos de ofrecer y qué compromisos de los demás tomar, al tiempo que consideran las necesidades actuales y el entorno. Los protocolos surgen a medida que los compromisos se unen a través del razonamiento de los agentes basados en la búsqueda de prueba durante la interacción. Además, los cambios continuos en el entorno se toman como entrada en la generación de protocolos por razonamiento del agente. Este es el reverso de otros enfoques que intentan hacer que la especificación sea flexible para acomodar los cambios en el entorno. Por lo tanto, está un paso más cerca de permitir protocolos emergentes, lo que hace que los protocolos sean más dinámicos y flexibles para el contexto. En pocas palabras, los servicios son lo que los agentes son capaces de proporcionar a otros agentes. Luego se puede ver que surgen compromisos de combinaciones de servicios, es decir, una unidad de recursos de consumo de capacidades de agentes se modela como una propuesta en lógica lineal. Las figuras numéricas se pueden usar para abreviar una conjunción multiplicativa de las mismas instancias. Por ejemplo, 2 dólar = dólar ⊗ dólar. Además, tales 3 A es una taquigrafía para A. Para abordar la manipulación dinámica de los recursos, también incluimos información sobre la ubicación y la propiedad de la codificación de recursos para abordar la reubicación y los cambios en la posesión de recursos durante la interacción del agente. Ese recurso A se encuentra en el Agente α y es propiedad del Agente β se expresa a través de una notación a la baja como una@αβ, que se trata como una propuesta lógica en nuestro marco. Esta notación puede extenderse más tarde a una construcción lógica más compleja para razonar sobre los cambios en la ubicación y la propiedad. En nuestro ejemplo de carrera, un cricket de cricket Bat B que está ubicado en y propiedad del Agente Mer se denota como Cricket B@M .m después de una venta exitosa al CUS del cliente del Agente, el Bat de Cricket será reubicado y propiedad del Agente CUS. El cricket b@cc reemplazará el cricket de fórmula b@mm para reflejar los cambios. Nuestro tratamiento de recursos ilimitados es modelarlo como un número σ de las copias de la fórmula de recursos de modo que el número σ se elige para ser extremadamente grande, en relación con el contexto. Por ejemplo, para indicar que el comerciante Mer puede emitir un número ilimitado de citas de venta en cualquier momento, utilizamos σ Sale Cita@M .M La declaración de acciones también se modela de manera similar a los recursos. Las capacidades de los agentes se refieren a producir, consumir, reubicar y cambiar la propiedad de los recursos. Las capacidades se representan describiendo el estado antes y después de realizarlas. El formulario de representación general es γ δ, en el que γ describe las condiciones antes y δ describe las condiciones posteriores. La implicación lineal en la lógica lineal asegura que las condiciones anteriores se transformen en las condiciones posteriores. Además, algunas capacidades se pueden aplicar en cualquier número de veces en el contexto de interacción y sus fórmulas también están precedidas por el número σ. Para tomar un ejemplo, consideramos la capacidad del Agente Mer de vender un bate de cricket por 10 dólares. Las condiciones anteriores son de 10 dólares y un método de pago del agente CUS: 10 $@cc ⊗ paga m@c. Dados estos, al aplicar la capacidad de THEC, MER ganará 10 dólares (10 $@mm) y com⊥) para que CUSM MIT proporcione un murciélago de cricket (Cricket B@M obtendrá un murciélago de cricket (Cricket B@CC). Juntos, la capacidad se codifica como 10 $@C ⊗ Pague M@C 10 $@MC C ⊗ Cricket B@C M ⊗ TIES. Por lo tanto, nuestro enfoque cambia a especificar un conjunto de compromisos de protocolo para especificar conjuntos de pre-compromisos como capacidades para cada agente. Los compromisos pueden ser ⊥ M Cricket B@M .C 3.2 Modelado de compromisos evaluados y manipulados por el mismo mecanismo lógico que se utiliza para las acciones, recursos y objetivos de los agentes, lo que simplifica en gran medida el sistema. Nuestro marco utiliza TLL como un medio para especificar protocolos de interacción. ENCOBIZOS varios conceptos, como recursos, capacidad y compromiso en TLL. La simetría entre una fórmula y su negación en TLL se explora como una forma de modelar recursos y compromisos. Luego discutimos el papel central de los compromisos previos y cómo se especifican en cada agente participante. Luego queda que los agentes razonen sobre los compromisos previos para formar compromisos de protocolo, discutimos el modelado de varios tipos de compromisos, sus cumplimientos y mecanismos de ejecución. Debido a la dualidad en la lógica lineal, las fórmulas positivas pueden considerarse como fórmulas en la oferta y las fórmulas negativas pueden considerarse como fórmulas en la demanda. Por lo tanto, adoptamos un enfoque de modelar compromisos no condicionales o base como fórmulas negativas. En particular, al convertir una fórmula en su forma negativa, se crea un compromiso base para derivar los recursos o llevar a cabo las acciones asociadas con la fórmula. En el ejemplo anterior, un compromiso del Agente Mer con ⊥ M. Que se descargan posteriormente.Proporcione un murciélago de cricket (cricket b@mm) es cricket b@m un compromiso base se cumple (descarga) cada vez que el agente de modelado 3.1 que cometió con éxito los respalda el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y recursos de sistemas de agentes múltiples (AAMAS 07) o lleva a cabo las acciones según lo requerido por el compromiso. En el modelado de TLL, esto significa que se deriva la fórmula positiva correspondiente. La resolución de los compromisos puede llevarse a cabo naturalmente por inferencia en TLL. Por ejemplo, el cricket b@m cumplirá el cricket de comandante b@m⊥ y ambas fórmulas se eliminan automáticamente como cricket b@mm ⊗ cricket b@m⊥ .m ⊥ bajo una suposición adicional de que se espera que los agentes resuelvan todosFórmulas en la demanda (eliminación de fórmulas negativas), esto crea una presión de conducción sobre los agentes para resolver los compromisos base. Esta presión se convierte en un mecanismo de aplicación natural e interno para los compromisos base. Se puede modelar un compromiso con las condiciones (o compromiso condicional) conectando las condiciones a los compromisos basados a través de una implicación lineal. Una forma general es γ δ donde γ es la parte de condición y δ incluye compromisos base. Si se deriva la condición γ, al consumir γ, la implicación lineal asegurará que los resultados de δ, lo que significa que los compromisos base en δ se vuelven efectivos. Si no se pueden lograr las condiciones, la implicación lineal no se puede aplicar y, por lo tanto, la parte del compromiso en el compromiso condicional aún está inactivo. En nuestro enfoque, los compromisos condicionales se especifican en su forma potencial como compromisos previos a los agentes participantes. Los compromisos previos se negocian entre los agentes a través de propuestas y al ser aceptados, formarán compromisos condicionales entre los agentes comprometidos. Los compromisos condicionales se interpretan como que la condición γ se requiere del agente propuesto y la parte de compromiso δ es responsabilidad del propietario (proponiendo) agente. De hecho, dicha interpretación y la codificación de realizar la noción de un compromiso condicional de que el agente del propietario está dispuesto a comprometerse a derivar δ dado que el agente propuesto satisface las condiciones γ. Compromisos condicionales, precomisos y capacidades tienen codificaciones similares. Sin embargo, sus diferencias se encuentran en las fases de compromiso en las que se encuentran. Las capacidades son utilizadas internamente por el agente del propietario y no implican ningún compromiso. Los compromisos previos pueden considerarse capacidades destinadas a formar compromisos condicionales. Al ser aceptado, los compromisos previos se convertirán en compromisos condicionales y llevarán a los dos agentes comprometidos a una fase de compromiso. Como ejemplo, considere que Mer tiene la capacidad de vender murciélagos de cricket: (10 $@cc ⊗pay m@cc) (10 $@m ⊗ cricket b@m⊥ ⊗ cricket b@cc). Cuando Merm M propone su capacidad para CUS, la capacidad actúa como un precommito. Cuando se acepta la propuesta, ese precommiteo se convertirá en un compromiso condicional en el que Mer se compromete a cumplir con el compromiso base Cricket B@M⊥ (que lleva a tener cricket b@cc) sobre la condición de que cus deriva 10 $@cc ⊗payM@C (que lleva a tener 10 $@mm). Los compromisos rompibles que existen para proporcionar a los agentes la flexibilidad deseada para eliminarse de sus compromisos (cancelar compromisos) también se modelan naturalmente en nuestro marco. Un compromiso base Com⊥ se convierte en un compromiso base rompible (cond ⊕ com) ⊥. El Cond ficha adicional refleja la deliberación interna de los agentes sobre cuándo se rompe el compromiso de derivar com. Una vez que se produce Cond, debido a la deducción lógica, Cond ⊗ (cond ⊕ com) ⊥ ⊥ ⊥, el compromiso (cond ⊕ com) ⊥ se elimina y, por lo tanto, rompe el compromiso de derivar com. Además, un compromiso condicional rompible se modela como un (1 b), en lugar de un B. Cuando se proporciona la condición A, la implicación lineal trae aproximadamente (1 b) y ahora depende de la elección interna de los agentes propietarios si se produce 1 o b. Si el agente elige 1, lo que prácticamente significa que no se deriva nada, entonces el compromiso condicional se rompe deliberadamente.3.3 Construcción del protocolo Dado el modelado de varios conceptos de interacción como recursos, acción, capacidad y compromiso, discutiremos cómo se pueden especificar los protocolos. En nuestro marco, cada agente está codificado con los recursos, acciones, capacidades, pre-compromisos, cualquier compromiso pendiente que tenga. Los compromisos previos, que provienen de los servicios que los agentes son capaces de proporcionar, están designados para ser intercambios justos. En un compromiso previo, todos los requisitos de la otra parte se colocan en la parte de la condición y todos los efectos que proporcionan el agente del propietario se ponen en la parte de compromiso para compensar una compensación. Tal diseño permite que los agentes propongan libremente los compromisos a cualquier parte interesada. Un ejemplo de precomisos es el de un comerciante de agentes con respecto a una venta de un murciélago de cricket: [10 $@cc ⊗pay m@c 10 $@mm ⊗ cricket b@cc ⊗cricket b@m⊥ m]. La condición es el requisito de que el agente del cliente proporcione 10 dólares, que se supone que es el precio de un murciélago de cricket, a través de un método de pago. El intercambio es el bate de cricket para el cliente (cricket b@cc) y, por lo tanto, es justo para el comerciante. Los protocolos se especifican en términos de conjuntos de pre-compromisos en los agentes participantes. Dados algunos compromisos de interacción iniciales, surge un protocolo a medida que los agentes son razonados sobre qué compromisos pre-comprometidos ofrecer y aceptar para cumplir con estos compromisos. Dada una especificación de protocolo de este tipo, luego discutimos cómo podría tener lugar la interacción. Una interacción puede comenzar con una solicitud o una propuesta. Cuando un agente no puede lograr algunos compromisos por sí mismo, puede solicitarles una solicitud o proponer un pre-compromiso relevante para un agente apropiado para cumplirlos. La elección de los pre-compromisos depende de si dichos compromisos pueden producir las fórmulas para cumplir con los agentes pendientes de compromisos. Cuando un agente recibe una solicitud, busca precommitaciones que en conjunto puedan producir las fórmulas requeridas de las solicitudes. Esos pre-compromisos encontrados se utilizarán como propuestas para los agentes solicitantes. De lo contrario, se devolverá un aviso de falla. Cuando se recibe una propuesta, el agente receptor también realiza una búsqueda con la inclusión de la propuesta de una prueba de esas fórmulas que pueden resolver sus compromisos. Si el resultado de la búsqueda es positivo, la propuesta se acepta y se convierte en un compromiso. El destinatario luego intenta cumplir con las condiciones de los compromisos. De lo contrario, la propuesta se rechaza y no se forma ningún compromiso. A lo largo de la interacción, la búsqueda de pruebas ha jugado un papel vital en la construcción de protocolo. La búsqueda de pruebas revela que algunos compromisos no se pueden resolver localmente o que algunos compromisos previos pueden usarse para resolver compromisos pendientes, lo que le da al agente que haga una solicitud o propuesta respectivamente. La búsqueda de pruebas también determina qué precommitaciones son relevantes para el cumplimiento de una solicitud, lo que ayuda a los agentes a decidir qué pre-compromisos proponer responder a la solicitud. Además, si una propuesta recibida c la sexta intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 127 es relevante para cualquier compromiso pendiente o no también está determinado por una búsqueda de pruebas de estos compromisos con una inclusión de la propuesta. Las condiciones de las propuestas se pueden resolver mediante la búsqueda de pruebas, ya que las vincula con los recursos y capacidades actuales de los agentes, así como cualquier precommitaje relevante. Por lo tanto, se puede ver que la búsqueda de pruebas realizada por los agentes participantes puede vincular sus respectivos pre-compromisos y convertirlos en compromisos según corresponda, lo que dan lugar a la formación de protocolo. Lo demostraremos a través de nuestro ejemplo de ejecución en la Sección 4. 3.4 Mensajes interactivos Los agentes interactúan enviando mensajes. Abordamos la interacción del agente en un modelo simple que contiene mensajes de solicitudes de tipo, propuestas, aceptación, rechazo y aviso de falla. Denotamos origen al destino: antes de cada mensaje para indicar la fuente y el destino del mensaje. Por ejemplo, Cust a Mer: denota que el mensaje se envía desde el Agente Cust al Agente Mer. Los mensajes de solicitud comenzar con la solicitud de palabra clave: solicitud + fórmula. Las fórmulas en los mensajes de solicitud son de compromisos. Los mensajes de la propuesta están precedidos a la propuesta. Las fórmulas son de capacidades. Por ejemplo, α a β: proponer γ δ es una propuesta del agente α al agente β. Hay mensajes que los agentes usan para responder a una propuesta. Los agentes pueden indicar una aceptación: aceptar, o un rechazo: rechazo. Para notar una falla al cumplir con una solicitud o propuesta, los agentes responden con esa solicitud o mensaje de propuesta adjunto con Fail.3.5 Generación de interacciones Como hemos visto, la lógica lineal temporal proporciona un medio elegante para codificar los diversos conceptos de interacción de agentes en un marco de especificación basado en el compromiso. La interacción apropiada se genera a medida que los agentes negocian sus compromisos previos especificados para cumplir con sus objetivos. La asociación entre los compromisos previos a los agentes participantes y el monitoreo de los compromisos para garantizar que todos se descargan se realicen mediante una búsqueda. En la siguiente sección, demostraremos cómo podrían funcionar la especificación y generación de interacciones en nuestro marco.4. Ejemplo volvemos al escenario de ventas en línea introducido en la Sección 1. 4.1 Especificando el protocolo Diseñamos un conjunto de pre-compromisos y capacidades para implementar el escenario anterior. Por simplicidad, nos referimos a ellas como reglas. Las reglas en Agent Mer tienen disponibles en cualquier momento 200 murciélagos de cricket para la venta y pueden emitir cotizaciones de venta en cualquier momento: 200 Cricket B@M ⊗ σ Sale Cita@M .M M Regla 1: Mer se compromete a ofrecer un murciélago de cricket (Cricket B@M⊥ m) a cus (cricket b@cc) si CUS paga 10 dólares (10 $@cc) ya sea a través de PayPal o tarjeta de crédito. La elección está en CUS.σ [10 $@c ⊗ (PayPal pagado@m ⊕ crédito pagado@mm) c m 10 $@m ⊗ cricket b@c ⊗ cricket b@m⊥ m c m] Regla 2: Si Ebank lleva a cabo el pago de crédito a Mer, entonces elSe cumple el requisito de pago de crédito en MER: σ [Credit PayM@M Credit Pagado@Mm] B Regla 3: Si Ebank informa a Mer de su desaprobación de Cuss Credit, entonces Mer también le informará a CUS.σ [Credit No AppR@M Credit No AppR@CB] B Reglas en el Agente Ebank Regla 4: Al recibir una cotización de venta de Mer, en el próximo punto de tiempo, Ebank se compromete a informar a Mer que Cuss Credit no está aprobado (el crédito noAprop@MB) o organizar un pago de crédito a MER (Credit PayM@MB). La decisión depende de la credibilidad de CUS y, por lo tanto, es externa (⊕) a Ebank y Mer: σ [cotización de venta@m (crédito no aprop@mb) ⊕m crédito paym@mb] Las reglas del agente cus tienen una cantidad de50 dólares disponibles en cualquier momento, se pueden usar para el pago de crédito o el pago en efectivo: $ 50@c.CUS tiene el compromiso de obtener un bate de cricket en algún momento: [Cricket B@CC] ⊥. Regla 5: CUS pagará a Mer a través de PayPal si hay una indicación de Ebank de que CUSS Credit no está aprobado: σ [crédito no aprob@c PayPal pagado@mm] B 4.2 Descripción de las solicitudes de interacción CUS de Mer a un murciélago de cricket en algunostiempo. Mer responde con una propuesta en la que cada murciélago de cricket cuesta 10 dólares. CUS necesita preparar 10 dólares y el pago se puede hacer a crédito o a través de PayPal. Suponiendo que CUS solo paga a través de PayPal si el pago de crédito falla, CUS permitirá que Mer cobre por crédito. Mer luego le pedirá a Ebank que organice un pago de crédito. Ebank propone que Mer ofrece una cita de venta y, dependiendo de la credibilidad de Cuss, en el próximo punto de tiempo, se organizará el pago de crédito o se informará una desaprobación de Cuss Credit. Mer acepta y cumple las condiciones. Si ocurre el primer caso, el pago de crédito se realiza. Si el segundo caso ocurre, el pago de crédito no se fallan, CUS puede retrasar la ruta para tomar la opción de pagar a través de PayPal. Una vez que se organice el pago, MER aplicará su propuesta original para satisfacer la solicitud CUSS de un bate de cricket y, por lo tanto, eliminar un bate de cricket y agregar 10 dólares a su conjunto de recursos.4.3 Interacción 1. CUS no puede cumplir su compromiso de [(cricket b@cc)] ⊥ y, por lo tanto, hace una solicitud al comerciante: c a m: solicitud [cricket b@cc] ⊥ 2. Para cumplir con la solicitud, MER busca las reglas aplicables. Una aplicación de la Regla 1 puede derivar Cricket B@C y Cricket B@C Cricket b@c. MER propondrá la Regla 1C C en una instancia de tiempo N1 a CUS como un pre-compromiso. M a c: proponer N1 [10 $@c ⊗ (PayPal pagado@m ⊕ crédito pagado@mm) c m 10 $@m ⊗ cricket b@c ⊗ cricket b@m⊥ m] con análisis similar, cus determina que dadaEl Con 128 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) se pueden satisfacer las ditiones, las propuestas pueden ayudar a obtener su solicitud. Por lo tanto, C a M: Aceptar análisis de CUS las condiciones de la propuesta aceptada por búsqueda de prueba.N110 $@cc;n1paypal pagado@m o n1credit pagado@mm;-(*)-M N110 $@C ⊗ (n1paypal pagado@m ⊕ n1credit pagado@mm) c m n1 (10 $@c ⊗ (paypal pagado@m ⊕ crédito pagado@mm)) C M de (*), de una manera de una maneraPara satisfacer las condiciones es que CUS deriva, en los siguientes puntos de tiempo N1, 10 dólares (N1 10 $@CC);y elegir pagar a través de PayPal (N1 PayPal pagado@mm) o por pago de crédito (crédito N1 pagado@mm).3. Derivando N1 10 $@C: Como CUS tiene 50 dólares, puede utilizar 10 dólares: 10 $@C 10 $@C N1 10 $@C. Suponemos que CUS prefiere el pago de crédito.4. Derivando el crédito N1 pagado@M: CUS no puede derivar esta fórmula por sí misma, por lo tanto, hará una solicitud a Mer: C a M: Solicitud [N1 crédito pagado@mm] ⊥.5. La regla 2 en MER es aplicable, pero MER no puede derivar su condición (N1 Credit PayM@MB). Por lo tanto, Mer hará una solicitud a Ebank. M a E: Solicitar [N1 Credit PayM@MB] ⊥ Ebank busca y encuentra aplicable la regla 4. Debido a que el crédito PayM@M estará disponible un punto de tiempo después del tiempo de solicitud de reglas de TB, Ebank propone merecer una instancia de la Regla 4 en los próximos puntos de tiempo N1-1.6. B a M: Proponer N1-1 [CITA@MM (crédito no Appr@M ⊕ Credit PayM@MB)] B Con un análisis similar, Mer acepta la propuesta. M a B: Aceptar la condición de la regla se cumple con Mer como cita@mm n1-1 cita@m. Por lo tanto, Ebank luego aplica la propuesta para derivar: N1-1 (crédito no aprop@m ⊕ crédito paym@mb) .b ⊕ Indica que la opción es externa a ambos agentes. Hay dos casos, Cuss Credit es aprobado o desaprobado. Para simplificar, mostramos solo el caso donde se aprueba Cuss Credit. En el siguiente (N1-1) punto de tiempo, N1-1 (crédito no Appr@MB ⊕ Credit PayM@MB) se convierte en N1-1 Credit PayM@M N1 Credit PayM@M .B B como resultado, en la siguiente hora N1Puntos, Ebank organizará el pago de crédito.7. Mer cumple con la solicitud inicial CUSS. Cuando cualquiera de N1 PayPal pagó@M (si CUS paga a través de Pay-M PAL) o N1 Credit Pagado@M (si CUS paga con tarjeta de crédito) M se deriva, N1 (Credit PayM@M ⊕ PayPal pagado@mm) tambiénDerivado, por lo tanto, se organiza el método de pago. Junto con la otra condición 10 $@c satisfecho, c Esto permite que la propuesta inicial sea aplicada por Mer para derivar el cricket n1 b@cc y un compromiso de n1 cricket b@m⊥ m para Mer, que también se resuelve por elCricket de recursos b@mm disponible en Mer. Cualquier valor de N1 tal que N1 - 1 ≥ 0 ⇔ N1 ≥ 1 permitirá que Mer cumpla con la solicitud inicial de [Cricket B@CC] ⊥. La interacción termina a medida que se resuelven todos los compromisos.4.4 Flexibilidad La flexibilidad deseada se ha logrado en el ejemplo. Es una decisión propia de proceder con el método de pago preferido. Además, el no determinismo de que si el crédito se desaprobe o el pago de crédito se realiza a Mer está fielmente representado. Si se produce una excepción que CUSS Credit no está aprobado, el crédito no Appr@C se produce y B CUS puede retroceder para pagar a través de PayPal. Luego se utilizará la Regla 5 para permitir que CUS maneje la excepción pagando a través de PayPal. Además, para especificar que realizar pagos y enviar murciélagos de cricket puede estar en cualquier orden, podemos agregar frente al método de pago en la Regla 1 de la siguiente manera: σ [10 $@C ⊗ (PayPal pagado@m ⊕ crédito pagado@mm) C m 10 $@m ⊗ cricket b@c ⊗ cricket b@m⊥ m] .m c Esta adición en la condición de la regla significa que el tiempo de pago puede ser hasta el tiempo para completar la elección, siempre que CUS pague yPor lo tanto, la orden de tiempo entre realizar pagos y enviar bienes se vuelve flexible.5. Codificación de cuestiones 5.1 Ventajas del marco TLL Nuestro marco TLL ha demostrado una especificación natural y expresiva de los protocolos de interacción de agentes. La implicación lineal () expresa una relación causal, lo que hace que sea natural modelar una eliminación o un consumo, especialmente de recursos, junto con sus consecuencias. Por lo tanto, en nuestro marco, la transformación de recursos se modela como una implicación lineal de los recursos consumidos para los recursos producidos. La reubicación de recursos se modela como una implicación lineal de un recurso en un agente a ese recurso en el otro agente. La implicación lineal también asegura que el cumplimiento de las condiciones de un compromiso condicional hará que los compromisos ocurran. Además, las actualizaciones estatales de los agentes se dan como resultado una implicación lineal desde el estado anterior hasta el estado actual. Los operadores temporales (y) y sus combinaciones ayudan a especificar el tiempo de acciones, de la disponibilidad de recursos y expresan el orden de tiempo de los eventos. Particularmente, los puntos de tiempo precisos se describen mediante el uso del operador o múltiples copias del mismo. Según esta capacidad de especificar puntos de tiempo correctos para acciones o eventos, también se puede capturar el orden de tiempo o la secuenciación de ellos. Además, una sensación de duración se simula extendiendo copias de los recursos o fórmulas de acciones en múltiples puntos de tiempo adyacentes. Además, la incertidumbre en el tiempo puede representar y razonarse mediante el uso de y sus combinaciones con.Se puede usar para expresar el no determinismo externo mientras expresa el no determinismo interno. Estas propiedades de tiempo de los recursos, acciones y eventos se respetan correctamente a lo largo del proceso de razonamiento del agente basado en reglas secuenciales de cálculo. Además, la centralidad de la noción de compromiso en la interacción del agente ha sido reconocida en muchos marcos [11, 12, 1, 10, 4]. Sin embargo, según nuestro conocimiento, modelar compromisos directamente en el nivel proposicional de tal recursos conscientes y la lógica consciente del tiempo como TLL es el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 129 Investigado en primer lugar en nuestro marco. Nuestro marco modela los compromisos básicos como fórmulas negativas y compromisos condicionales mediante el uso de implicaciones lineales y/o fórmulas negativas. El modelado de compromisos tiene una serie de ventajas: • Los compromisos se representan directamente en el nivel lógico proposicional o a través de una construcción lógica conectiva en lugar de una construcción no lógica como [11], lo que hace que el tratamiento de los compromisos sea más natural y simple y permite hacerUso de sistemas de búsqueda de pruebas fácilmente disponibles como usar el cálculo de secuencias para el manejo de compromisos. Los conectivos lógicos existentes como ⊗, ⊕, también están disponibles para describir las relaciones entre los compromisos.• El cumplimiento de los compromisos se convierte en derivando las fórmulas o fórmulas de condición positivas correspondientes, que simplemente se reducen a una tarea de búsqueda de prueba. Además, dadas las fórmulas requeridas, el cumplimiento de los compromisos se puede implementar de manera fácil y automática como deducción (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥). La aplicación de los compromisos también es interna y • simplemente se implementa a través del supuesto de que los agentes están impulsados a eliminar todas las fórmulas negativas para los compromisos base y mediante el uso de implicaciones lineales para los compromisos condicionales. Con respecto a hacer que la especificación del protocolo sea más flexible, nuestro enfoque ha marcado una serie de puntos significativos. En primer lugar, la flexibilidad de las especificaciones de protocolo en nuestro marco proviene del poder expresivo de los conectivos de TLL.y ⊕ Consulte las opciones internas y externas de los agentes sobre los recursos y acciones, y consulte las opciones internas y las opciones externas en el dominio del tiempo. Dado que la flexibilidad incluye la capacidad de tomar una decisión sensata, tener las opciones expresadas explícitamente en la especificación de los protocolos de interacción brinda a los agentes la oportunidad de razonar sobre las elecciones correctas durante la interacción y, por lo tanto, explorar la flexibilidad en ellos. En segundo lugar, en lugar de ser secuencias de acciones interactivas, los protocolos están estructurados en compromisos, que son más abstractos que las acciones de protocolo. La ejecución de protocolos se basa en los compromisos de cumplimiento. Por lo tanto, las restricciones innecesarias sobre las que ahora se eliminan las acciones interactivas particulares para ejecutar por las cuales se eliminan los agentes y en el orden entre ellos, lo que es un paso adelante a la flexibilidad en comparación con los enfoques tradicionales. Por otro lado, en presencia de cambios introducidos externamente, los agentes tienen la libertad de explorar nuevos conjuntos de acciones interactivas o omitir algunas acciones interactivas por delante siempre que aún cumplan los compromisos de los protocolos. Esto aporta más flexibilidad al nivel general de comportamientos interactivos de los agentes y, por lo tanto, al protocolo. En tercer lugar, el protocolo se especifica de manera declarativa esencialmente como conjuntos de pre-compromisos en cada agente participante. Para lograr objetivos, los agentes usan el razonamiento basado en el cálculo secuente de TLL para construir pruebas de objetivos a partir de los compromisos y las fórmulas estatales. Esto esencialmente les da a los agentes una autonomía en la utilización de los compromisos previos y, por lo tanto, los agentes pueden adaptar las formas en que los usan para tratar de manera flexible con entornos cambiantes. En particular, a medida que la construcción de la prueba por parte de los agentes selecciona una secuencia de pre-compromisos para la interacción, poder seleccionar de todas las combinaciones posibles de pre-compromisos en la búsqueda de prueba ofrece más oportunidades y flexibilidad que seleccionar solo unas pocas secuencias fijas y predefinidas. Entonces también es más probable que permita a los agentes manejar excepciones o explorar las oportunidades que surgen. Además, como el orden real de los compromisos está determinado por el proceso de construcción de prueba en lugar de predefinidos, los agentes pueden cambiar de manera flexible el orden para adaptarse a nuevas situaciones. En cuarto lugar, se puede considerar que los cambios en el entorno eliminan o agregan fórmulas a las fórmulas de estado. Debido a que la construcción de pruebas por parte de los agentes tiene en cuenta las fórmulas del estado actual cuando recoge los compromisos previos, los cambios en las fórmulas estatales se reflejarán en la elección de los pre-compromisos relevantes para proceder. Por lo tanto, los agentes tienen la flexibilidad de decidir qué hacer para lidiar con los cambios. Por último, especificar protocolos en nuestro marco tiene un enfoque modular que agrega facilidad y flexibilidad al proceso de diseño de protocolos. Los protocolos se especifican colocando un conjunto de pre-compromisos en cada agente participante de acuerdo con sus roles. De hecho, cada pre-compromiso puede especificarse como un proceso en sí mismo con fórmulas de condición como sus fórmulas de piezas de entrada y compromiso como salida. La ejecución de cada compromiso condicional es un hilo relativamente independiente y están vinculados juntos por la búsqueda de prueba para cumplir con los compromisos de los agentes. Como resultados, con tal diseño de pre-compromisos, se puede agregar o eliminar un pre-compromiso sin interferir a los demás y, por lo tanto, lograr un diseño modular de los protocolos.5.2 Limitaciones del marco TLL en el modelado Como todos los operadores temporales en TLL se refieren a puntos de tiempo concretos, no podemos expresar duraciones en el tiempo fielmente. Una gran desventaja de simular una duración de un evento al difundir copias de ese evento por puntos de tiempo adyacentes a⊗ 10 continuamente (como A⊗ 2 ... A) es que requiere el rango de tiempo que se proporciona explícitamente. Por lo tanto, tal noción como hasta que no se puede expresar naturalmente en TLL. Los compromisos de los agentes pueden estar en conflicto, especialmente cuando resolverlos todos requieren más recursos o acciones que los que tienen los agentes. Nuestro trabajo no ha cubierto los compromisos de manejo que están en conflicto. Otro aspecto problemático de este enfoque es que las reglas para la interacción requieren algún conocimiento detallado de las fórmulas de la lógica lineal temporal. Claramente, sería beneficioso tener una herramienta visual similar a los diagramas UML que permitirían que los no expertos especifiquen las reglas apropiadas sin tener que aprender los detalles de las fórmulas mismas.6. Conclusiones y trabajo adicional Este documento usa TLL para especificar protocolos de interacción. En particular, TLL se utiliza para modelar el concepto de recursos, capacidad, pre-compromiso y compromiso con una integración estrecha, así como sus manipulaciones con respecto al tiempo. Luego, los agentes utilizan técnicas de búsqueda de pruebas para realizar las interacciones deseadas. En particular, el enfoque permite que las especificaciones de protocolo capturen el significado de las acciones interactivas a través de compromisos, capturar las elecciones internas y las opciones externas de los agentes sobre los recursos, los compromisos y el tiempo, así como los procesos de actualización. El mecanismo de construcción de prueba 130 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), proporciona a los agentes la capacidad de seleccionar dinámicamente los pre-compromisos y, por lo tanto, ayudan a los agentes a obtener la flexibilidad de elegir las acciones interactivas que son más adecuadas y la flexibilidad en el orden deellos, teniendo en cuenta los cambios continuos en el medio ambiente. Muchos otros enfoques para los protocolos de modelado también utilizan el concepto de compromiso para aportar más significado a las acciones interactivas de los agentes. Los enfoques basados en máquinas de compromiso [11, 12, 10, 1] soportan una serie de problemas. Estos enfoques utilizan sistemas lógicos que están limitados en su expresividad para modelar recursos. Además, a medida que se crea una capa extra abstracta de compromisos, se crean más tareas en consecuencia. En particular, debe haber un mapeo diseñado por humanos entre las acciones de protocolo y las operaciones sobre los compromisos, así como entre las variables de control (fluida) y las fases de logro de compromiso. Además, los mecanismos externos deben estar en su lugar para comprender y manejar las operaciones y la resolución de los compromisos, así como la aplicación de la noción de compromiso en sus representaciones de tipo de datos abstractos. Esto requiere otra ejecución en la capa de compromiso junto con la ejecución real del protocolo. No solo estas tareas adicionales crean una sobrecarga, sino que también hace que la especificación y ejecución de los protocolos sean más propensos a errores. Trabajos similares en [8] y [9] exploran las ventajas de la lógica lineal y la TLL respectivamente mediante el uso de técnicas de deducción parcial para ayudar a los agentes a descubrir las capacidades o recursos faltantes y, según eso, para negociar con otros agentes sobre estrategias de cooperación. Nuestro enfoque difiere de aportar el concepto de compromiso en el modelado de la interacción y proporcionar un mapa más natural y detallado para especificar la interacción, especialmente sobre las opciones, el tiempo y la actualización utilizando el TLL proposicional completo. Además, enfatizamos el uso de pre-compromisos como reglas de interacción con un conjunto completo de reglas de inferencia de TLL para proporcionar las ventajas de la construcción de pruebas para lograr una interacción flexible. Nuestro trabajo adicional incluirá el uso de TLL para verificar varias propiedades de los protocolos de interacción, como la vida y la seguridad. Además, investigaremos el desarrollo de un mecanismo de ejecución para tales especificaciones de TLL en nuestro marco.

        "Section 6 presents our conclusions and items of further work. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND In order to increase the agents autonomy over their interactive behaviors, protocols should be specified in terms of what is to be achieved rather than how the agents should act.",
        "In other words, protocols should be specified in a declarative manner.",
        "Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.",
        "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
        "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
        "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
        "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
        "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
        "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",
        "In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.",
        "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
        "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",
        "A ⊗ (multiplicative conjunction) A, means that one has two As at the same time, which is different from A ∧ A = A.",
        "Hence, ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion.",
        "A ℘ (multiplicative disjunction) B, means that if not A then B or vice versa but not both A and B.",
        "The ability to specify choices via the additive connectives is a particularly useful feature of linear logic.",
        "A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.",
        "A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which.",
        "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",
        "For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the clients, we use A ⊕ B.",
        "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
        "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
        "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
        "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
        "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",
        "Temporal logic can be used for specification and verification of concurrent and reactive programs [2].",
        "Temporal Linear Logic (TLL) [6] is the result of introducing temporal logic into linear logic and hence is resourceconscious as well as deals with time.",
        "The temporal operators used are (next), (anytime), and (sometime) [6].",
        "Formulas with no temporal operators can be considered as being available only at present.",
        "Adding to a formula A, i.e.",
        "A, means that A can be used only at the next time and exactly once.",
        "Similarly, A means that A can be used at any time and exactly once.",
        "A means that A can be used once at some time.",
        "Though both and refer to a point in time, the choice of which time is different.",
        "Regarding , the choice is an internal choice, as appropriate to ones own capability.",
        "With , the choice is externally decided by others. 2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction.",
        "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",
        "In particular, persistence in commitments introduces into agents consideration a certain level of predictability of other agents actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 125 resources sharing [7].",
        "Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11].",
        "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
        "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",
        "Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal computations [11].",
        "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
        "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",
        "Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.",
        "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
        "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
        "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
        "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
        "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
        "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
        "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
        "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
        "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
        "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",
        "In a nutshell, services are what agents are capable of providing to other agents.",
        "Commitments can then be seen to arise from combinations of services, i.e. an agents capabiliA unit of consumable resources is modeled as a proposition in linear logic.",
        "Numeric figures can be used to abbreviate a multiplicative conjunction of the same instances.",
        "For example, 2 dollar = dollar ⊗ dollar.",
        "Moreover, such 3 A is a shorthand for A.",
        "In order to address the dynamic manipulation of resources, we also include information about the location and ownership in the encoding of resources to address the relocation and changes in possession of resources during agent interaction.",
        "That resource A is located at agent α and owned by agent β is expressed via a shorthand notation as A@αβ , which is treated as a logic proposition in our framework.",
        "This notation can be later extended to a more complex logic construct to reason about changes in location and ownership.",
        "In our running example, a cricket bat cricket b being located at and owned by agent Mer is denoted as cricket b@M .M After a successful sale to the agent customer Cus, the cricket bat will be relocated to and owned by agent Cus.",
        "The formula cricket b@CC will replace the formula cricket b@MM to reflect the changes.",
        "Our treatment of unlimited resources is to model it as a number σ of copies of the resources formula such that the number σ is chosen to be extremely large, relative to the context.",
        "For instance, to indicate that the merchant Mer can issue an unlimited number of sale quotes at any time, we use σ sale quote@M .M Declaration of actions is also modeled in a similar manner as of resources.",
        "The capabilities of agents refer to producing, consuming, relocating and changing ownership of resources.",
        "Capabilities are represented by describing the state before and after performing them.",
        "The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after.",
        "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
        "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
        "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",
        "The conditions before are 10 dollars and a payment method from agent Cus: 10$@CC ⊗ pay m@C .",
        "Given these, by applying theC capability, Mer will gain 10 dollars (10$@MM ) and com⊥ ) so that CusM mit to providing a cricket bat (cricket b@M will get a cricket bat (cricket b@CC ).",
        "Together, the capability is encoded as 10$@C ⊗ pay m@C 10$@MC C ⊗ cricket b@C M ⊗ ties.",
        "Hence, our approach shifts specifying a set of protocol commitments to specifying sets of pre-commitments as capabilities for each agent.",
        "Commitments are then can be ⊥ M cricket b@M .C 3.2 Modeling commitmentsreasoned about and manipulated by the same logic mechanism as is used for the agents actions, resources and goals, which greatly simplifies the system.",
        "Our framework uses TLL as a means of specifying interaction protocols.",
        "We encode various concepts such as resource, capability and commitment in TLL.",
        "The symmetry between a formula and its negation in TLL is explored as a way to model resources and commitments.",
        "We then discuss the central role of pre-commitments, and how they are specified at each participating agent.",
        "It then remains for agents to reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments, We discuss the modeling of various types of commitments, their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms.",
        "Due to duality in linear logic, positive formulas can be regarded as formulas in supply and negative formulas can be regarded as formulas in demand.",
        "Hence, we take an approach of modeling non-conditional or base commitments as negative formulas.",
        "In particular, by turning a formula into its negative form, a base commitment to derive the resources or carry out the actions associated with the formula is created.",
        "In the above example, a commitment of agent Mer to ⊥ M .which are subsequently discharged. provide a cricket bat (cricket b@MM ) is cricket b@M A base commitment is fulfilled (discharged) whenever the 3.1 Modeling resources and capabilities committing agent successfully brings about the respective 126 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) resources or carries out the actions as required by the commitment.",
        "In TLL modeling, this means that the corresponding positive formula is derived.",
        "Resolution of commitments can then be naturally carried out by inference in TLL.",
        "For example, cricket b@M will fulfil the commit-M ment cricket b@M⊥ and both formulas are automaticallyM removed as cricket b@MM ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ .M ⊥ Under a further assumption that agents are expected to resolve all formulas in demand (removing negative formulas), this creates a driving pressure on agents to resolve base commitments.",
        "This pressure then becomes a natural and internal enforcement mechanism for base commitments.",
        "A commitment with conditions (or conditional commitment) can be modeled by connecting the conditions to base commitments via a linear implication.",
        "A general form is Γ Δ where Γ is the condition part and Δ includes base commitments.",
        "If the condition Γ is derived, by consuming Γ, the linear implication will ensure that Δ results, which means the base commitments in Δ become effective.",
        "If the conditions can not be achieved, the linear implication can not be applied and hence commitment part in the conditional commitment is still inactive.",
        "In our approach, conditional commitments are specified in their potential form as pre-commitments of participating agents.",
        "Pre-commitments are negotiated among agents via proposals and upon being accepted, will form conditional commitments among the engaged agents.",
        "Conditional commitments are interpreted as that the condition Γ is required of the proposed agent and the commitment part Δ is the responsibility of the owner (proposing) agent.",
        "Indeed, such interpretation and the encoding of realize the notion of a conditional commitment that owner agent is willing to commit to deriving Δ given the proposed agent satisfies the conditions Γ.",
        "Conditional commitments, pre-commitments and capabilities all have similar encodings.",
        "However, their differences lie in the phases of commitment that they are in.",
        "Capabilities are used internally by the owner agent and do not involve any commitment.",
        "Pre-commitments can be regarded as capabilities intended for forming conditional commitments.",
        "Upon being accepted, pre-commitments will turn into conditional commitments and bring the two engaged agents into a commitment phase.",
        "As an example, consider that Mer has a capability of selling cricket bats: (10$@CC ⊗pay m@CC ) (10$@M ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ ⊗ cricket b@CC ).",
        "When MerM M proposes its capability to Cus, the capability acts as a precommitment.",
        "When the proposal gets accepted, that precommitment will turn into a conditional commitment in which Mer commits to fulfilling the base commitment cricket b@M⊥ (which leads to having cricket b@CC ) uponM the condition that Cus derives 10$@CC ⊗pay m@C (whichC leads to having 10$@MM ).",
        "Breakable commitments which are in place to provide agents with the desired flexibility to remove itself from its commitments (cancel commitments) are also modeled naturally in our framework.",
        "A base commitment Com⊥ is turned into a breakable base commitment (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ .",
        "The extra token cond reflects the agents internal deliberation about when the commitment to derive Com is broken.",
        "Once cond is produced, due to the logic deduction cond ⊗ (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ ⊥, the commitment (cond ⊕ Com)⊥ is removed, and hence breaking the commitment of deriving Com.",
        "Moreover, a breakable conditional commitment is modeled as A (1 B), instead of A B.",
        "When the condition A is provided, the linear implication brings about (1 B) and it is now up to the owner agents internal choice whether 1 or B is resulted.",
        "If the agent chooses 1, which practically means nothing is derived, then the conditional commitment is deliberately broken. 3.3 Protocol Construction Given the modeling of various interaction concepts like resource, action, capability, and commitment, we will discuss how protocols can be specified.",
        "In our framework, each agent is encoded with the resources, actions, capabilities, pre-commitments, any pending commitments that it has.",
        "Pre-commitments, which stem from services the agents are capable of providing, are designated to be fair exchanges.",
        "In a pre-commitment, all the requirements of the other party are put in the condition part and all the effects to be provided by the owner agent are put on the commitment part to make up a trade-off.",
        "Such a design allows agents to freely propose pre-commitments to any interested parties.",
        "An example of pre-commitments is that of an agent Merchant regarding a sale of a cricket bat: [10$@CC ⊗pay m@C 10 $@MM ⊗ cricket b@CC ⊗cricket b@M⊥ M ].",
        "The condition is the requirement that the customer agent provides 10 dollars, which is assumed to be the price of a cricket bat, via a payment method.",
        "The exchange is the cricket bat for the customer ( cricket b@CC ) and hence is fair to the merchant.",
        "Protocols are specified in terms of sets of pre-commitments at participating agents.",
        "Given some initial interaction commitments, a protocol emerges as agents are reasoning about which pre-commitments to offer and accept in order to fulfill these commitments.",
        "Given a such a protocol specification, we then discuss how interaction might take place.",
        "An interaction can start with a request or a proposal.",
        "When an agent can not achieve some commitments by itself, it can make a request of them or propose a relevant pre-commitment to an appropriate agent to fulfill them.",
        "The choice of which pre-commitments depends on if such pre-commitments can produce the formulas to fulfill the agents pending commitments.",
        "When an agent receives a request, it searches for precommitments that can together produce the required formulas of the requests.",
        "Those pre-commitments found will be used as proposals to the requesting agents.",
        "Otherwise, a failure notice will be returned.",
        "When a proposal is received, the recipient agent also performs a search with the inclusion of the proposal for a proof of those formulas that can resolve its commitments.",
        "If the search result is positive, the proposal is accepted and becomes a commitment.",
        "The recipient then attempts to fulfill conditions of the commitments.",
        "Otherwise, the proposal is refused and no commitment is formed.",
        "Throughout the interaction, proof search has played a vital role in protocol construction.",
        "Proof search reveals that some commitments can not be resolved locally or some pre-commitments can be used to resolve pending commitments, which prompts the agent to make a request or proposal respectively.",
        "Proof search also determines which precommitments are relevant to fulfillment of a request, which helps agents to decide which pre-commitments to propose to answer the request.",
        "Moreover, whether a received proposal C The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 127 is relevant to any pending commitments or not is also determined by a search for proof of these commitments with an inclusion of the proposal.",
        "Conditions of proposals can be resolved by proof search as it links them with the agents current resources and capabilities as well as any relevant precommitments.",
        "Therefore, it can be seen that proof search performed by participating agents can link up their respective pre-commitments and turn them into commitments as appropriate, which give rise to protocol formation.",
        "We will demonstrate this via our running example in section 4. 3.4 Interactive Messages Agents interact by sending messages.",
        "We address agent interaction in a simple model which contains messages of type requests, proposals, acceptance, refusal and failure notice.",
        "We denote Source to Destination: prior to each message to indicate the source and destination of the message.",
        "For example Cust to Mer: denotes that the message is sent from agent Cust to agent Mer.",
        "Request messages start with the key word REQUEST: REQUEST + formula.",
        "Formulas in request messages are of commitments.",
        "Proposal messages are preceded with PROPOSE.",
        "Formulas are of capabilities.",
        "For example, α to β: PROPOSE Γ Δ is a proposal from agent α to agent β.",
        "There are messages that agents use to response to a proposal.",
        "Agents can indicate an acceptance: ACCEPT, or a refusal: REFUSE.",
        "To notice a failure in fulfilling a request or proposal, agents reply with that request or proposal message appended with FAIL. 3.5 Generating Interactions As we have seen, temporal linear logic provides an elegant means for encoding the various concepts of agent interaction in a commitment based specification framework.",
        "Appropriate interaction is generated as agents negotiate their specified pre-commitments to fulfill their goals.",
        "The association among pre-commitments at participating agents and the monitoring of commitments to ensure that all are discharged are performed by proof search.",
        "In the next section, we will demonstrate how specification and generation of interactions in our framework might work. 4.",

        "Linear implication ( ) expresses causal relationship, which makes it natural to model a removal or a consumption, especially of resources, together with its consequences.",
        "Hence, in our framework, resource transformation is modeled as a linear implication of the consumed resources to the produced resources.",
        "Resource relocation is modeled as a linear implication from a resource at one agent to that resource at the other agent.",
        "Linear implication also ensures that fulfillment of the conditions of a conditional commitment will cause the commitments to happen.",
        "Moreover, state updates of agents are resulted from a linear implication from the old state to the current state.",
        "Temporal operators ( , and ) and their combinations help to specify the time of actions, of resource availability and express the time order of events.",
        "Particularly, precise time points are described by the use of operator or multiple copies of it.",
        "Based on this ability to specify correct time points for actions or events, time order or sequencing of them can also be captured.",
        "Also, a sense of duration is simulated by spreading copies of the resources or actions formulas across multiple adjacent time points.",
        "Moreover, uncertainty in time can represented and reasoned about by the use of and and their combinations with . can be used to express outer non-determinism while expresses inner non-determinism.",
        "These time properties of resources, actions and events are correctly respected through out the agent reasoning process based on sequent calculus rules.",
        "Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4].",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
        "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
        "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
        "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
        "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
        "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
        "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
        "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
        "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
        "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
        "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
        "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
        "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
        "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
        "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
        "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
        "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
        "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
        "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
        "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
        "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
        "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
        "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
        "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
        "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
        "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
        "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
        "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
        "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
        "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
        "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
        "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
        "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
        "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
        "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
        "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
        "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
        "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
        "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
        "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
        "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
        "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
        "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
        "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
        "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
        "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
        "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
        "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
        "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
        "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
        "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
        "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",

                "These time properties of resources, actions and events are correctly respected through out the agent reasoning process based on sequent calculus rules.",
                "Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4].",
                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
                "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",

                "Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4].",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents <br>interactive behavior</br>s, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4].",
                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
                "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",

                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
                "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",
                "In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.",
                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",

                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",

                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",

                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of <br>interaction protocol</br>s provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying <br>interaction protocol</br>s.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of <br>interaction protocol</br>s such as liveness and safety.",

                "Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly.",
                "To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.",

                "Thirdly, choosing a sequence of interactive actions should be based on reasoning about the intrinsic meanings of protocol actions, which are based on the notion of commitment, i.e. which refers to a strong promise to other agent(s) to undertake some courses of action.",

                "Based on this ability to specify correct time points for actions or events, time order or sequencing of them can also be captured.",

                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal <br>linear logic</br>.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of <br>linear logic</br> and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly.",
                "To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.",

                "Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.",
                "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
                "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",
                "In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.",
                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
                "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",
                "A ⊗ (<br>multiplicative conjunction</br>) A, means that one has two As at the same time, which is different from A ∧ A = A.",
                "Hence, ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion.",
                "A ℘ (multiplicative disjunction) B, means that if not A then B or vice versa but not both A and B.",
                "The ability to specify choices via the additive connectives is a particularly useful feature of linear logic.",
                "A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.",
                "A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which.",
                "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",
                "For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the clients, we use A ⊕ B.",
                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",

                "With , the choice is externally decided by others. 2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction.",
                "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",
                "In particular, persistence in commitments introduces into agents consideration a certain level of predictability of other agents actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl.",

                "Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11].",
                "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
                "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",
                "Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal computations [11].",
                "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
                "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",
                "Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.",
                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
                "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
                "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",
                "In a nutshell, services are what agents are capable of providing to other agents.",
                "Commitments can then be seen to arise from combinations of services, i.e. an agents capabiliA unit of consumable resources is modeled as a proposition in linear logic.",

                "The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after.",
                "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
                "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
                "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",

                "It then remains for agents to reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments, We discuss the modeling of various types of commitments, their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms.",

                "In particular, by turning a formula into its negative form, a base commitment to derive the resources or carry out the actions associated with the formula is created.",

                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",

                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",

                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",

                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",

                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",

                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",

                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",

                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",

                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",

                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",

                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",

                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
                "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",

                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each <br>pre-commitment</br> can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one <br>pre-commitment</br> can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, <br>pre-commitment</br> and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of <br>linear implication</br> and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of <br>linear implication</br> for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Linear implication also ensures that fulfillment of the conditions of a conditional commitment will cause the commitments to happen.",

                "Particularly, precise time points are described by the use of operator or multiple copies of it.",
                "Based on this ability to specify correct time points for actions or events, time order or sequencing of them can also be captured.",

                "Furthermore, the centrality of the notion of commitment in agent interaction has been recognized in many frameworks [11, 12, 1, 10, 4].",
                "However, to the best of our knowledge, modeling commitments directly at the propositional level of such a resource conscious and time aware logic as TLL is The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 129 firstly investigated in our framework.",
                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
                "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",

                "The agent paradigm has become well suited as a design metaphor to deal with complex systems comprising many components each having their own thread of control and purposes and involved in dynamic and complex interactions.",
                "In multi-agent environments, agents often need to interact with each other to fulfill their goals.",
                "Protocols are used to regulate interactions.",
                "In traditional approaches to protocol specification, like those using Finite State Machines or Petri Nets, protocols are often predetermined legal sequences of interactive behaviors.",
                "In frequently changing environments such as the Internet, such fixed sequences can quickly become outdated and are prone to failure.",
                "Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly.",
                "To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.",
                "Also, agents should be allowed to adjust their interactive actions to take advantages of opportunities or handle exceptions that arise during interaction.",
                "For example, consider the scenario below for online sales.",
                "A merchant Mer has 200 cricket bats available for sale with a unit price of 10 dollars.",
                "A customer Cus has $50.",
                "Cus has a goal of obtaining from Mer a cricket bat at some time.",
                "There are two options for Cus to pay.",
                "If Cus uses credit payment, Mer needs a bank Ebank to check Cuss credit.",
                "If Cuss credit is approved, Ebank will arrange the credit payment.",
                "Otherwise, Cus may then take the option to pay via PayPal.",
                "The interaction ends when goods are delivered and payment is arranged.",
                "A flexible approach to this example should include several features.",
                "Firstly, the payment method used by Cus should be at Cuss own choice and have the property that if Cuss credit check results in a disapproval, this exception should also be handled automatically by Cuss switching to PayPal.",
                "Secondly, there should be no unnecessary constraint on the order in which actions are performed, such as which of making payments and sending the cricket bat should come first.",
                "Thirdly, choosing a sequence of interactive actions should be based on reasoning about the intrinsic meanings of protocol actions, which are based on the notion of commitment, i.e. which refers to a strong promise to other agent(s) to undertake some courses of action.",
                "Current approaches [11, 12, 10, 1] to achieve flexibilities using the notion of commitment make use of an abstract layer of commitments.",
                "However, in these approaches, a mapping from protocol actions onto operations on commitments 124 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS as well as handling and enforcement mechanisms of commitments must be externally provided.",
                "Execution of protocol actions also requires concurrent execution of operations on related commitments.",
                "As a result, the overhead of processing the commitment layer makes specification and execution of protocols more complicated and error prone.",
                "There is also a lack of a logic to naturally express aspects of resources, internal and external choices as well as time of protocols.",
                "Rather than creating another layer of commitment outside protocol actions, we try to achieve a modeling of commitments that is integrated with protocol actions.",
                "Both commitments and protocol actions can then be reasoned about in one consistent system.",
                "In order to achieve that, we specify protocols in a declarative manner, i.e. what is to be achieved rather then how agents should interact.",
                "A key to this is using logic.",
                "Temporal logic, in particular, is suitable for describing and reasoning about temporal constraints while linear logic [3] is quite suitable for modeling resources.",
                "We suggest using a combination of linear logic and temporal logic to construct a commitment based interaction framework which allows both temporal and resource-related reasoning for interaction protocols.",
                "This provides a natural manipulation and reasoning mechanism as well as internal enforcement mechanisms for commitments based on proof search.",
                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 discusses the background material of linear logic, temporal linear logic and commitments.",
                "Section 3 introduces our modeling framework and specification of protocols.",
                "Section 4 discusses how our framework can be used for an example of online sale interactions between a merchant, a bank and a customer.",
                "We then discuss the advantages and limitations of using our framework to model interaction protocols and achieve flexibility in Section 5.",
                "Section 6 presents our conclusions and items of further work. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND In order to increase the agents autonomy over their interactive behaviors, protocols should be specified in terms of what is to be achieved rather than how the agents should act.",
                "In other words, protocols should be specified in a declarative manner.",
                "Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.",
                "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
                "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",
                "In order to resolve such resource - formula mapping issues, Girard proposed the constraints on which formulas will be used exactly once and can no longer be freely added or removed in derivations and hence treating linear logic formulas as resources.",
                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
                "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",
                "A ⊗ (multiplicative conjunction) A, means that one has two As at the same time, which is different from A ∧ A = A.",
                "Hence, ⊗ allows a natural expression of proportion.",
                "A ℘ (multiplicative disjunction) B, means that if not A then B or vice versa but not both A and B.",
                "The ability to specify choices via the additive connectives is a particularly useful feature of linear logic.",
                "A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.",
                "A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which.",
                "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",
                "For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the clients, we use A ⊕ B.",
                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",
                "Temporal logic can be used for specification and verification of concurrent and reactive programs [2].",
                "Temporal Linear Logic (TLL) [6] is the result of introducing temporal logic into linear logic and hence is resourceconscious as well as deals with time.",
                "The temporal operators used are (next), (anytime), and (sometime) [6].",
                "Formulas with no temporal operators can be considered as being available only at present.",
                "Adding to a formula A, i.e.",
                "A, means that A can be used only at the next time and exactly once.",
                "Similarly, A means that A can be used at any time and exactly once.",
                "A means that A can be used once at some time.",
                "Though both and refer to a point in time, the choice of which time is different.",
                "Regarding , the choice is an internal choice, as appropriate to ones own capability.",
                "With , the choice is externally decided by others. 2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction.",
                "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",
                "In particular, persistence in commitments introduces into agents consideration a certain level of predictability of other agents actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 125 resources sharing [7].",
                "Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11].",
                "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
                "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",
                "Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal computations [11].",
                "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
                "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",
                "Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.",
                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
                "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
                "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",
                "In a nutshell, services are what agents are capable of providing to other agents.",
                "Commitments can then be seen to arise from combinations of services, i.e. an agents capabiliA unit of consumable resources is modeled as a proposition in linear logic.",
                "Numeric figures can be used to abbreviate a multiplicative conjunction of the same instances.",
                "For example, 2 dollar = dollar ⊗ dollar.",
                "Moreover, such 3 A is a shorthand for A.",
                "In order to address the dynamic manipulation of resources, we also include information about the location and ownership in the encoding of resources to address the relocation and changes in possession of resources during agent interaction.",
                "That resource A is located at agent α and owned by agent β is expressed via a shorthand notation as A@αβ , which is treated as a logic proposition in our framework.",
                "This notation can be later extended to a more complex logic construct to reason about changes in location and ownership.",
                "In our running example, a cricket bat cricket b being located at and owned by agent Mer is denoted as cricket b@M .M After a successful sale to the agent customer Cus, the cricket bat will be relocated to and owned by agent Cus.",
                "The formula cricket b@CC will replace the formula cricket b@MM to reflect the changes.",
                "Our treatment of unlimited resources is to model it as a number σ of copies of the resources formula such that the number σ is chosen to be extremely large, relative to the context.",
                "For instance, to indicate that the merchant Mer can issue an unlimited number of sale quotes at any time, we use σ sale quote@M .M Declaration of actions is also modeled in a similar manner as of resources.",
                "The capabilities of agents refer to producing, consuming, relocating and changing ownership of resources.",
                "Capabilities are represented by describing the state before and after performing them.",
                "The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after.",
                "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
                "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
                "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",
                "The conditions before are 10 dollars and a payment method from agent Cus: 10$@CC ⊗ pay m@C .",
                "Given these, by applying theC capability, Mer will gain 10 dollars (10$@MM ) and com⊥ ) so that CusM mit to providing a cricket bat (cricket b@M will get a cricket bat (cricket b@CC ).",
                "Together, the capability is encoded as 10$@C ⊗ pay m@C 10$@MC C ⊗ cricket b@C M ⊗ ties.",
                "Hence, our approach shifts specifying a set of protocol commitments to specifying sets of pre-commitments as capabilities for each agent.",
                "Commitments are then can be ⊥ M cricket b@M .C 3.2 Modeling commitmentsreasoned about and manipulated by the same logic mechanism as is used for the agents actions, resources and goals, which greatly simplifies the system.",
                "Our framework uses TLL as a means of specifying interaction protocols.",
                "We encode various concepts such as resource, capability and commitment in TLL.",
                "The symmetry between a formula and its negation in TLL is explored as a way to model resources and commitments.",
                "We then discuss the central role of pre-commitments, and how they are specified at each participating agent.",
                "It then remains for agents to reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments, We discuss the modeling of various types of commitments, their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms.",
                "Due to duality in linear logic, positive formulas can be regarded as formulas in supply and negative formulas can be regarded as formulas in demand.",
                "Hence, we take an approach of modeling non-conditional or base commitments as negative formulas.",
                "In particular, by turning a formula into its negative form, a base commitment to derive the resources or carry out the actions associated with the formula is created.",
                "In the above example, a commitment of agent Mer to ⊥ M .which are subsequently discharged. provide a cricket bat (cricket b@MM ) is cricket b@M A base commitment is fulfilled (discharged) whenever the 3.1 Modeling resources and capabilities committing agent successfully brings about the respective 126 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Resolution of commitments can then be naturally carried out by inference in TLL.",
                "For example, cricket b@M will fulfil the commit-M ment cricket b@M⊥ and both formulas are automaticallyM removed as cricket b@MM ⊗ cricket b@M⊥ .M ⊥ Under a further assumption that agents are expected to resolve all formulas in demand (removing negative formulas), this creates a driving pressure on agents to resolve base commitments.",
                "This pressure then becomes a natural and internal enforcement mechanism for base commitments.",
                "A commitment with conditions (or <br>conditional commitment</br>) can be modeled by connecting the conditions to base commitments via a linear implication.",
                "A general form is Γ Δ where Γ is the condition part and Δ includes base commitments.",
                "If the condition Γ is derived, by consuming Γ, the linear implication will ensure that Δ results, which means the base commitments in Δ become effective.",

                "Pre-commitments are negotiated among agents via proposals and upon being accepted, will form conditional commitments among the engaged agents.",
                "Conditional commitments are interpreted as that the condition Γ is required of the proposed agent and the commitment part Δ is the responsibility of the owner (proposing) agent.",

                "Pre-commitments can be regarded as capabilities intended for forming conditional commitments.",
                "Upon being accepted, pre-commitments will turn into conditional commitments and bring the two engaged agents into a commitment phase.",

                "In a pre-commitment, all the requirements of the other party are put in the condition part and all the effects to be provided by the owner agent are put on the commitment part to make up a trade-off.",

                "An example of pre-commitments is that of an agent Merchant regarding a sale of a cricket bat: [10$@CC ⊗pay m@C 10 $@MM ⊗ cricket b@CC ⊗cricket b@M⊥ M ].",

                "Conditions of proposals can be resolved by proof search as it links them with the agents current resources and capabilities as well as any relevant precommitments.",
                "Therefore, it can be seen that proof search performed by participating agents can link up their respective pre-commitments and turn them into commitments as appropriate, which give rise to protocol formation.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each <br>conditional commitment</br> is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly.",
                "To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.",

                "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",

                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
                "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",

                "A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.",
                "A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which.",
                "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",
                "For instance, to specify that the choice of places A or B for goods delivery is ours as the supplier, we use A B, or is the clients, we use A ⊕ B.",
                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",

                "With , the choice is externally decided by others. 2.3 Commitment The concept of social commitment has been recognized as fundamental to agent interaction.",
                "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",
                "In particular, persistence in commitments introduces into agents consideration a certain level of predictability of other agents actions, which is important when agents deal with issues of inter-dependencies, global constraints or The Sixth Intl.",

                "Commitment based approaches associate protocols actions with operations on commitments and protocol states with the set of effective commitments [11].",
                "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
                "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",
                "Hence, the approaches systematically enhance a variety of legal computations [11].",
                "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
                "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",
                "Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.",
                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
                "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
                "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",
                "In a nutshell, services are what agents are capable of providing to other agents.",
                "Commitments can then be seen to arise from combinations of services, i.e. an agents capabiliA unit of consumable resources is modeled as a proposition in linear logic.",

                "In order to address the dynamic manipulation of resources, we also include information about the location and ownership in the encoding of resources to address the relocation and changes in possession of resources during agent interaction.",
                "That resource A is located at agent α and owned by agent β is expressed via a shorthand notation as A@αβ , which is treated as a logic proposition in our framework.",
                "This notation can be later extended to a more complex logic construct to reason about changes in location and ownership.",
                "In our running example, a cricket bat cricket b being located at and owned by agent Mer is denoted as cricket b@M .M After a successful sale to the agent customer Cus, the cricket bat will be relocated to and owned by agent Cus.",
                "The formula cricket b@CC will replace the formula cricket b@MM to reflect the changes.",
                "Our treatment of unlimited resources is to model it as a number σ of copies of the resources formula such that the number σ is chosen to be extremely large, relative to the context.",
                "For instance, to indicate that the merchant Mer can issue an unlimited number of sale quotes at any time, we use σ sale quote@M .M Declaration of actions is also modeled in a similar manner as of resources.",
                "The capabilities of agents refer to producing, consuming, relocating and changing ownership of resources.",
                "Capabilities are represented by describing the state before and after performing them.",
                "The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after.",
                "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
                "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
                "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",
                "The conditions before are 10 dollars and a payment method from agent Cus: 10$@CC ⊗ pay m@C .",

                "Hence, our approach shifts specifying a set of protocol commitments to specifying sets of pre-commitments as capabilities for each agent.",

                "We encode various concepts such as resource, capability and commitment in TLL.",
                "The symmetry between a formula and its negation in TLL is explored as a way to model resources and commitments.",
                "We then discuss the central role of pre-commitments, and how they are specified at each participating agent.",
                "It then remains for agents to reason about pre-commitments to form protocol commitments, We discuss the modeling of various types of commitments, their fulfillments and enforcement mechanisms.",
                "Due to duality in linear logic, positive formulas can be regarded as formulas in supply and negative formulas can be regarded as formulas in demand.",
                "Hence, we take an approach of modeling non-conditional or base commitments as negative formulas.",
                "In particular, by turning a formula into its negative form, a base commitment to derive the resources or carry out the actions associated with the formula is created.",
                "In the above example, a commitment of agent Mer to ⊥ M .which are subsequently discharged. provide a cricket bat (cricket b@MM ) is cricket b@M A base commitment is fulfilled (discharged) whenever the 3.1 Modeling resources and capabilities committing agent successfully brings about the respective 126 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",
                "Also, given the required formulas, fulfillment of commitments can be implemented easily and automatically as deduction (com ⊗ com⊥ ⊥).",
                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",
                "Protocols are specified by placing a set of pre-commitments at each participating agent according to their roles.",
                "Each pre-commitment can indeed be specified as a process in its own with condition formulas as its input and commitment parts formulas as its output.",
                "Execution of each conditional commitment is a relatively independent thread and they are linked together by the proof search to fulfill agents commitments.",
                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",

                "In frequently changing environments such as the Internet, such fixed sequences can quickly become outdated and are prone to failure.",
                "Therefore, agents are required to adapt their interactive behaviors to succeed and interactions among agents should not be constructed rigidly.",
                "To achieve flexibility, as characterized by Yolum and Singh in [11], interaction protocols should ensure that agents have autonomy over their interactive behaviors, and be free from any unnecessary constraints.",
                "Also, agents should be allowed to adjust their interactive actions to take advantages of opportunities or handle exceptions that arise during interaction.",

                "In other words, protocols should be specified in a declarative manner.",
                "Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.",
                "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
                "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",

                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
                "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",

                "A (additive conjunction) B, stands for one own choice, either of A or B but not both.",
                "A ⊕ (additive disjunction) B, stands for the possibility of either A or B, but we dont know which.",
                "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",

                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",

                "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",

                "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
                "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",

                "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
                "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",
                "Agents can negotiate about pre-commitments by sending proposals of them to others.",
                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
                "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
                "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",

                "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
                "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
                "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",

                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",

                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",

                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",

                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",

                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",

                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",

                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",

                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",

                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",

                "Our framework models base commitments as negative formulas and conditional commitments via the use of linear implication and/or negative formulas.",
                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",
                "This essentially gives agents an autonomy in utilization of pre-commitments and hence agents can adapt the ways they use these to flexibly deal with changing environments.",
                "In particular, as proof construction by agents selects a sequence of pre-commitments for interaction, being able to select from all the possible combinations of pre-commitments in proof search gives more chances and flexibility than selecting from only a few fixed and predefined sequences.",
                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",
                "Hence, the agents have the flexibility in deciding what to do to deal with changes.",
                "Lastly, specifying protocols in our framework has a modular approach which adds ease and flexibility to the designing process of protocols.",

                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",

                "Using logic is central to this specification process. 2.1 Linear Logic Logic has been used as formalism to model and reason about agent systems.",
                "Linear logic [3] is well-known for modeling resources as well as updating processes.",
                "It has been considered in agent systems to support agent negotiation and planning by means of proof search [5, 8].",
                "In real life, resources are consumed and new resources are created.",
                "In such logic as classical or temporal logic, however, a direct mapping of resources onto formulas is troublesome.",
                "If we model resources like A as one dollar and B as a chocolate bar, then A ⇒ B in classical logic is read as from one dollar we can get a chocolate bar.",
                "This causes problems as the implication allows to get a chocolate bar (B is true) while retaining one dollar (A remains true).",

                "In linear logic, a linear implication A B, however, allows A to be removed after deriving B, which means the dollar is gone after using one dollar to buy a chocolate bar.",
                "Classical conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) are recast over different uses of contexts - multiplicative as combining and additive as sharing to come up with four connectives.",

                "As remarked in [5], and ⊕ allow choices to be made clear between internal choices (ones own), and external choices (others choice).",

                "In agent systems, this duality between inner and outer choices is manifested by one agent having the power to choose between alternatives and the other having to react to whatever choice is made.",
                "Moreover, during interaction, the ability to match consumption and supply of resources among agents can simplify the specification of resource allocations.",
                "Linear logic is a natural mechanism to provide this ability [5].",
                "In addition, it is emphasized in [8] that linear logic is used to model agent states as sets of consumable resources and particularly, linear implication is used to model transitions among states and capabilities of agents. 2.2 Temporal Linear Logic While linear logic provides advantages to modeling and reasoning about resources, it does not deal naturally with time constraints.",
                "Temporal logic, on the other hand, is a formal system which addresses the description and reasoning about the changes of truth values of logic expressions over time [2].",

                "Indeed, social commitment provides intrinsic meanings of protocol actions and states [11].",

                "Completing the protocol is done via means-end reasoning on commitment operations to bring the current state to final states where all commitments are resolved.",
                "From then, the corresponding legal sequences of interactive actions are determined.",

                "Commitments can be reduced to a more fundamental form known as pre-commitments.",
                "A pre-commitment here refers to a potential commitment that specifies what the owner agent is willing to commit [4], like performing some actions or achieving a particular state.",

                "The others can respond by agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal or proposing another pre-commitment.",
                "Once a precommitment is agreed, it then becomes a commitment and the process moves from negotiation phase to commitment phase, in which the agents act to fulfill their commitments. 3.",
                "MODELING AGENT INTERACTIONS Protocols are normally viewed external to agents and are essentially a set of commitments externally imposed on participating agents.",
                "We take an internal view of protocols, i.e. from the view of participating agents by putting the specification of commitments locally at the respective agents according to their roles.",
                "Such an approach enables agents to manage their own protocol commitments.",
                "Indeed, agents no longer accept and follow a given set of commitments but can reason about which commitments of theirs to offer and which commitments of others to take, while considering the current needs and the environment.",
                "Protocols arise as commitments are then linked together via agents reasoning based on proof search during the interaction.",
                "Also, ongoing changes in the environment are taken as input into the generation of protocols by agent reasoning.",
                "This is the reverse of other approaches which try to make the specification flexible to accommodate changes in the environment.",
                "Hence, it is a step closer to enabling emergent protocols, which makes protocols more dynamic and flexible to the context.",

                "Capabilities are represented by describing the state before and after performing them.",
                "The general representation form is Γ Δ, in which Γ describes the conditions before and Δ describes the conditions after.",
                "The linear implication in linear logic indeed ensures that the conditions before will be transformed into the conditions after.",
                "Moreover, some capabilities can be applied at any number of times in the interaction context and their formulas are also preceded by the number σ.",
                "To take an example, we consider the capability of agent Mer of selling a cricket bat for 10 dollars.",

                "The modeling of commitments has a number of advantages: • Commitments are represented directly at the propositional logic level or via a logic connective rather than a non-logical construct like [11], which makes treatment of commitments more natural and simple and allows to make use of readily available proof search systems like using sequent calculus for handling commitments.",
                "Existing logic connectives like ⊗, , ⊕, are also readily available for describing the relationships among commitments. • Fulfillment of commitments then becomes deriving the corresponding positive formulas or condition formulas, which then simply reduces to a proof search task.",

                "The enforcement of commitments is also internal and• simply implemented via the assumption that agents are driven to remove all negative formulas for base commitments and via the use of linear implication for conditional commitments.",
                "Regarding making protocol specification more flexible, our approach has marked a number of significant points.",
                "Firstly, flexibility of protocol specifications in our framework comes from the expressive power of the connectives of TLL. and ⊕ refer to internal and external choices of agents on resources and actions while and refer to internal choices and external choices in time domain.",
                "Given that flexibility includes the ability to make a sensible choice, having the choices expressed explicitly in the specification of interaction protocols provides agents with an opportunity to reason about the right choices during interaction and hence explore the flexibility in them.",
                "Secondly, instead of being sequences of interactive actions, protocols are structured on commitments, which are more abstract than protocol actions.",
                "Execution of protocols is then based on fulfilling commitments.",
                "Hence, unnecessary constraints on which particular interactive actions to execute by which agents and on the order among them are now removed, which is a step forward to flexibility as compared to traditional approaches.",
                "On the other hand, in the presence of changes introduced externally, agents have the freedom to explore new sets of interactive actions or skip some interactive actions ahead as long as they still fulfill the protocols commitments.",
                "This brings more flexibility to the overall level of agents interactive behaviors, and thus the protocol.",
                "Thirdly, the protocol is specified in a declarative manner essentially as sets of pre-commitments at each participating agents.",
                "To achieve goals, agents use reasoning based on TLL sequent calculus to construct proofs of goals from pre-commitments and state formulas.",

                "It is then also more likely to allow agents to handle exceptions or explore opportunities that arise.",
                "Moreover, as the actual order of pre-commitments is determined by the proof construction process rather than predefined, agents can flexibly change the order to suit new situations.",
                "Fourthly, changes in the environment can be regarded as removing or adding formulas onto the state formulas.",
                "Because the proof construction by agents takes into account the current state formulas when it picks up pre-commitments, changes in the state formulas will be reflected in the choice of which relevant pre-commitments to proceed.",

                "As a results, with such a design of pre-commitments, one pre-commitment can be added or removed without interfering the others and hence, achieving a modular design of the protocols. 5.2 Limitations of TLL Framework on Modeling As all the temporal operators in TLL refer to concrete time points, we can not express durations in time faithfully.",
                "One major disadvantage of simulating a duration of an event by spreading copies of that event over adjacent time points A⊗ 10 continuously (like A⊗ 2 . . .",
                "A) is that it requires the time range to be provided explicitly.",
                "Hence, such notion like until can not be naturally expressed in TLL.",
                "Commitments of agents can be in conflict, especially when resolving all of them requires more resources or actions than what agents have.",
                "Our work has not covered handling commitments that are in conflict.",
                "Another troublesome aspect of this approach is that the rules for interaction require some detailed knowledge of the formulas of temporal linear logic.",
                "Clearly it would be beneficial to have a visually-based tool similar to UML diagrams which would allow non-experts to specify the appropriate rules without having to learn the details of the formulas themselves. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK This paper uses TLL for specifying interaction protocols.",
                "In particular, TLL is used to model the concept of resource, capability, pre-commitment and commitment with tight integration as well as their manipulations with respect to time.",
                "Agents then make use of proof search techniques to perform the desired interactions.",
                "In particular, the approach allows protocol specifications to capture the meaning of interactive actions via commitments, to capture the internal choices and external choices of agents about resources, commitments and about time as well as updating processes.",
                "The proof construction mechanism 130 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) provides agents with the ability to dynamically select appropriate pre-commitments, and hence, help agents to gain the flexibility in choosing the interactive actions that are most suitable and the flexibility in the order of them, taking into consideration on-going changes in the environment.",
                "Many other approaches to modeling protocols also use the commitment concept to bring more meaning into agents interactive actions.",
                "Approaches based on commitment machines [11, 12, 10, 1] endure a number of issues.",
                "These approaches use logic systems that are limited in their expressiveness to model resources.",
                "Also, as an extra abstract layer of commitments is created, more tasks are created accordingly.",
                "In particular, there must be a human-designed mapping between protocol actions and operations on commitments as well as between control variables (fluent) and phases of commitment achievement.",
                "Moreover, external mechanisms must be in place to comprehend and handle operations and resolution of commitments as well as enforcement of the notion of commitment on its abstract data type representations.",
                "This requires another execution in the commitment layer in conjunction with the actual execution of the protocol.",
                "Not only these extra tasks create an overhead but also makes the specification and execution of protocols more error prone.",
                "Similar works in [8] and [9] explore the advantages of linear logic and TLL respectively by using partial deduction techniques to help agents to figure out the missing capabilities or resources and based on that, to negotiate with other agents about cooperation strategies.",
                "Our approach differs in bringing the concept of commitment into the modeling of interaction, and providing a more natural and detailed map for specifying interaction, especially about choices, time and updating using the full propositional TLL.",
                "Moreover, we emphasize on the use of pre-commitments as interaction rules with a full set of TLL inference rules to provide the advantages of proof construction in achieving flexible interaction.",
                "Our further work will include using TLL to verify various properties of interaction protocols such as liveness and safety.",
                "Also, we will investigate developing an execution mechanism for such TLL specifications in our framework.",
