Although the main action that the Slammer worm takes is a relatively unsophisticated replication of itself, it still spreads so quickly that human response was ineffective. Most proposed countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms. However, such strategies are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer. In our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be radically different, and potentially such techniques will prove ineffective. Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence. Emergent Intelligence is the behavior of systems, very much like biological systems such as ants or bees, where simple local interactions of autonomous members, with simple primitive actions, gives rise to complex and intelligent global behavior. In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a swarm worm. In addition, we will present preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm. We will show that ZachiK is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.

INTRODUCTION AND PREVIOUSWORK In the early morning hours (05:30 GMT) of January 25, 2003 the fastest computer worm in recorded history began spreading throughout the Internet. Within 10 minutes after the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant disruption to the global Internet infrastructure. Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction. Since Slammer, researchers have explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms. For example, Zou, et al., [2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to detect the early propagation of a worm. Other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the organization to the potential presence of a worm. However, such strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome. That is, systems are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer. In the work described here, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations. Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence. The concept of emergent intelligence was first studied in association with biological systems. In such studies, early researchers discovered a variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild. A flock of birds sweeps across the sky. A group of ants forages for food. A school of fish swims, turns, flees together away from a predator, ands so forth. In general, this kind of aggregate motion has been called swarm behavior. Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and 323 attempted to create models that explain how the elements of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve. Moreover, in recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in transportation systems, in military applications, and other areas, see [3]. The basic concepts that have been developed over the last decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include four basic components. These are: 1. Simplicity of logic & actions: A swarm is composed of N agents whose intelligence is limited. Agents in the swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions. Some models called this primitive actions or behaviors; 2. Local Communication Mechanisms: Agents interact with other members in the swarm via simple local communication mechanisms. For example, a bird in a flock senses the position of adjacent bird and applies a simple rule of avoidance and follow. 3. Distributed control: Autonomous agents interact with their environment, which probably consists of other agents, but act relatively independently from all other agents. There is no central command or leader, and certainly there is no global plan. 4. Emergent Intelligence: Aggregate behavior of autonomous agents results in complex intelligent behaviors; including self-organization. In order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms it is necessary to construct a model that explains the behavior of what we will call generic worms. This model, which extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2. In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more harmful than their similar generic counterparts. Specifically, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms are capable of compromising hosts at rates up to two orders of magnitude faster than their generic counterpart. The rest of this manuscript is structure as follows. In section 2 an abstract model of both generic worms as well as swarm worms is presented. This model is used in section 2.6 to described the first instance of a swarm worm, ZachiK. In section 4, preliminary results via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is presented. Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights into future work are presented. 2. WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance. In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions. By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program. Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things. We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation. We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has. The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target. Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next. Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated. This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment. Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host. In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load. Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions. This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5]. Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories. Here, we further extend their work through parameterization. Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host. Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference. Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space. This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based). Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value). Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split). Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include. Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines. Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data. This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author. The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning. Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle. The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning. Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host. This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination. Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts. Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction. Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies. For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets. Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias. It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same. Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts. Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method. The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at. For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection. This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used. The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes. One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan. Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit. In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent. Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms. In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses. They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system. We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar. We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed. It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way. This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list. The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module. The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks. This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization. It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has. Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern. Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern. Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage. In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized. Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions. In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes. These are: 1. Simplicity of logic & actions; 2. Local Communication Mechanisms; 3. Distributed control; and 4. Emergent Intelligence, including self-organization. 325 Structure Function/Example Infection, Infection Vector Executable is run Protection & Stealthiness Disable McAfee (Staying Alive) Propagation Send email to everyone in address book Goal Based Action (GBA) DDoS www.sco.com Everything else, often called payload Figure 1: General Worm Model In this work we aggregate all of these attributes under the general title of Learning, Communication, and Distributed Control. The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of malware such as Zombies. In figure ??, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions. Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information. On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not. This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise. The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous. Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior. Specifically, â¢ DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN â 99 â 04.html). DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm Attacks due to the large number of agents involved. â¢ Code Red CrV1, Code Red II, Nimbda - Exhibit early notions of swarm attacks, including a backdoor communication channel. â¢ Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1, Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of behavior. For example, they speculate on new worms which employ direct worm-to-worm communication, and employ programmable updates. For example the Warhol worm, and Permutation-Scanning (self coordinating) worms. 2.6 Swarm Worm: the details In considering the creation of what we believed to be the first Swarm Worm in existence, we wanted to adhere as close as possible to the general model presented in section ?? while at the same time facilitating large scale analysis, both empirical and through simulations, of the behavior of the swarm. For this reason, we selected as the first instance Structure Function/Example Infection, Infection Vector Executable is run Protection & Stealthiness Disable McAfee (Staying Alive) Propagation Send email to everyone in address book Learning, Communication, Pheromones/Flags (Test and Distributed Control if Worm is already present) Time bombs, Learning Algorithms, IRC channel Goal Based Action (GBA) DDoS www.sco.com Everything else, often called payload Figure 2: General Model of a Swarm Worm of the swarm a simple password cracking worm. The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords. Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates. In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host. We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators. As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before. In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH. A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random. When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins. After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself. The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors). It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets. It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network. Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study. However, the reader should consider the following: 1. ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors. For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2. ZachiK is a proof of concept worm. The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3. ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space. Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses. However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents. For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small. In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought. In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied. These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above. In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts. However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm. The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists. Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices. Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated. When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages. There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands. The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented. The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs). The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors. The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list. These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible. The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively. The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account). Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address. Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively. In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list. The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals. These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed. The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers. The simulator was written in C++ . The simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors. In the case of a simple local area network of 30 computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected. At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero. All shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes. Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets. For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts. In such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets. The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 4. RESULTS In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented. In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords. The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms. The class of worms presented are as follows: â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings. As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms. In this set of experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm. Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart. In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed. These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment. Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds. Note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password space. In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are presented. In this set of simulation runs, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets. The data presented reflects the behaviors of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies (random scanning and local bias). The amount of local bias was varied across multiple simulation runs. The results presented are aggregate behaviors. In general the following class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated. Address Scanning: â¢ Random:= addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space; and â¢ Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space. The percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs. Learning, Communication & Distributed Control â¢ I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/ memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/ memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information with offsprings only (OOS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; â¢ S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP); â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings. As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with our set of empirical results. In addition, the following observations can be made. 1. Local preference is incredibly effective. 2. Short address handoffs are more effective than long ones. We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3. For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm. In this case, we can think of the swarm as launching a distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use different passwords to try to break into susceptible uninfected host. In the local bias mode, early in the life of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered. Then the targeting of local addresses assists in discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and 4. Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time in non-local bias mode. Basically, the shared password list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm reverts to simply a random discovery of password algorithm.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this manuscript, we have presented an abstract model, similar in some aspects to that of Weaver [5], that helps explain the generic nature of worms. The model presented in section 2 was extended to incorporate a new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more harmful than their generic counterparts. In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms is capable of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth capabilities. This work opens up a new area of interesting problems. Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be consider are as follows: â¢ Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way that true emergent behavior takes place? â¢ Are the current techniques being developed in the design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new class of worms?; and â¢ What techniques, if any, can be developed to create defenses against swarm worms? 6.

Aunque la acciÃ³n principal que toma el gusano del slammer es una replicaciÃ³n relativamente poco sofisticada de sÃ­ misma, todavÃ­a se propaga tan rÃ¡pido que la respuesta humana era ineficaz. La mayorÃ­a de las estrategias de contramedidas propuestas se basan principalmente en la detecciÃ³n de tasas y los algoritmos limitantes. Sin embargo, tales estrategias estÃ¡n siendo diseÃ±adas y desarrolladas para contener eficazmente gusanos cuyos comportamientos son similares a los de Slammer. En nuestro trabajo, presentamos la hipÃ³tesis de que los gusanos de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n serÃ¡n radicalmente diferentes, y potencialmente tales tÃ©cnicas resultarÃ¡n ineficaces. EspecÃ­ficamente, proponemos estudiar una nueva generaciÃ³n de gusanos llamados gusanos de enjambre, cuyo comportamiento se basa en el concepto de inteligencia emergente. La inteligencia emergente es el comportamiento de los sistemas, muy parecidos a los sistemas biolÃ³gicos como las hormigas o las abejas, donde las interacciones locales simples de los miembros autÃ³nomos, con acciones primitivas simples, da lugar al comportamiento global complejo e inteligente. En este manuscrito introduciremos los principios bÃ¡sicos detrÃ¡s de la idea de los gusanos de enjambre, asÃ­ como la estructura bÃ¡sica requerida para ser considerado un gusano de enjambre. AdemÃ¡s, presentaremos resultados preliminares sobre las velocidades de propagaciÃ³n de uno de esos gusanos de enjambre, llamado gusano zachik. Mostraremos que Zachik es capaz de propagarse a una velocidad 2 Ã³rdenes de magnitud mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que los gusanos similares sin capacidades de enjambre.

IntroducciÃ³n y trabajo previo en las primeras horas de la maÃ±ana (05:30 GMT) del 25 de enero de 2003 El gusano informÃ¡tico mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido en la historia registrada comenzÃ³ a difundirse por Internet. Dentro de los 10 minutos posteriores al primer huÃ©sped infectado (paciente cero), el 90 por ciento de todos los huÃ©spedes vulnerables se habÃ­an visto comprometidos creando una interrupciÃ³n significativa en la infraestructura global de Internet. Vern Paxson, del Instituto Internacional de Ciencias de la ComputaciÃ³n y el Laboratorio Nacional de Lawrence Berkeley, en su anÃ¡lisis de Slammer, comentÃ³: El gusano Slammer se extendiÃ³ tan rÃ¡pido que la respuesta humana fue ineficaz, ver [4] la parte interesante, desde nuestra perspectiva, sobre la propagaciÃ³n de Slammer ISque era un gusano relativamente poco sofisticado con comportamiento benigno, a saber, la auto-reproducciÃ³n. Desde Slammer, los investigadores han explorado los comportamientos de los gusanos de propagaciÃ³n rÃ¡pida y han diseÃ±ado estrategias de contramedidas basadas principalmente en la detecciÃ³n de tarifas y los algoritmos limitantes. Por ejemplo, Zou, et al., [2], propuso un esquema donde se usa un filtro Kalman para detectar la propagaciÃ³n temprana de un gusano. Otros investigadores han propuesto el uso de detectores donde las tasas de mensajes inalcanzables de destino son monitoreadas por firewalls, y un aumento significativo mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de lo normal, alerta a la organizaciÃ³n sobre la presencia potencial de un gusano. Sin embargo, tales estrategias sufren del sÃ­ndrome de la Ãºltima guerra. Es decir, los sistemas estÃ¡n siendo diseÃ±ados y desarrollados para contener efectivamente gusanos cuyos comportamientos son similares a los de Slammer. En el trabajo descrito aquÃ­, presentamos la hipÃ³tesis de que los gusanos de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n serÃ¡n diferentes y, por lo tanto, tales tÃ©cnicas pueden tener algunas limitaciones significativas. EspecÃ­ficamente, proponemos estudiar una nueva generaciÃ³n de gusanos llamados gusanos de enjambre, cuyo comportamiento se basa en el concepto de inteligencia emergente. El concepto de inteligencia emergente se estudiÃ³ por primera vez en asociaciÃ³n con sistemas biolÃ³gicos. En tales estudios, los primeros investigadores descubrieron una variedad de interesantes comportamientos de insectos o animales en la naturaleza. Una bandada de pÃ¡jaros atraviesa el cielo. Un grupo de forrajes de hormigas para alimentos. Una escuela de peces nadan, giros, pulgas juntas de un depredador, etc. En general, este tipo de movimiento agregado se ha llamado comportamiento del enjambre. Los biÃ³logos y los informÃ¡ticos en el campo de la inteligencia artificial han estudiado tales enjambres biolÃ³gicos, y 323 intentaron crear modelos que expliquen cÃ³mo los elementos de un enjambre interactÃºan, logran objetivos y evolucionan. AdemÃ¡s, en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os, el estudio de la inteligencia del enjambre se ha vuelto cada vez mÃ¡s importante en los campos de la robÃ³tica, el diseÃ±o de redes ad-hoc mÃ³viles (Manets), el diseÃ±o de sistemas de detecciÃ³n de intrusos, el estudio de los patrones de trÃ¡fico en los sistemas de transporte, en militares, en militaresAplicaciones y otras Ã¡reas, ver [3]. Los conceptos bÃ¡sicos que se han desarrollado en la Ãºltima dÃ©cada para explicar los enjambres, y el comportamiento del enjambre incluyen cuatro componentes bÃ¡sicos. Estos son: 1. Simplicidad de la lÃ³gica y las acciones: un enjambre estÃ¡ compuesto por n agentes cuya inteligencia es limitada. Los agentes en el enjambre utilizan reglas locales simples para gobernar sus acciones. Algunos modelos llamaron a estas acciones o comportamientos primitivos;2. Mecanismos de comunicaciÃ³n local: los agentes interactÃºan con otros miembros en el enjambre a travÃ©s de simples mecanismos de comunicaciÃ³n local. Por ejemplo, un pÃ¡jaro en un rebaÃ±o detecta la posiciÃ³n del ave adyacente y aplica una regla simple de evitar y seguir.3. Control distribuido: los agentes autÃ³nomos interactÃºan con su entorno, que probablemente consiste en otros agentes, pero actÃºan de manera relativamente independiente de todos los demÃ¡s agentes. No existe un comando o lÃ­der central, y ciertamente no hay un plan global.4. Inteligencia emergente: el comportamiento agregado de los agentes autÃ³nomos da como resultado comportamientos inteligentes complejos;incluyendo autoorganizaciÃ³n. Para comprender completamente el comportamiento de tales enjambres, es necesario construir un modelo que explique el comportamiento de lo que llamaremos gusanos genÃ©ricos. Este modelo, que extiende el trabajo de Weaver [5], se presenta aquÃ­ en la SecciÃ³n 2. AdemÃ¡s, tenemos la intenciÃ³n de extender dicho modelo de tal manera que explica claramente los comportamientos de esta nueva clase de gusanos potencialmente peligrosos llamados gusanos de enjambre. Los gusanos de enjambre se comportan mucho como enjambres biolÃ³gicos y exhiben un alto grado de aprendizaje, comunicaciÃ³n e inteligencia distribuida. Tales gusanos enjambres son potencialmente mÃ¡s daÃ±inos que sus contrapartes genÃ©ricas similares. EspecÃ­ficamente, se creÃ³ la primera instancia, hasta donde sabemos, se creÃ³ un gusano de aprendizaje, llamado Zachik. Zachik es un gusano de enjambre de crujido de contraseÃ±a simple que incorpora diferentes estrategias de aprendizaje e intercambio de informaciÃ³n. Tal gusano de enjambre se implementÃ³ tanto en una red de Ã¡rea local de treinta (30) hosts, asÃ­ como se simulÃ³ en una topologÃ­a de 10,000 nodos. Los resultados preliminares mostraron que tales gusanos son capaces de comprometer los huÃ©spedes a velocidades de hasta dos Ã³rdenes de magnitud mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que su contraparte genÃ©rica. El resto de este manuscrito es la estructura de la siguiente manera. En la SecciÃ³n 2 se presenta un modelo abstracto de gusanos genÃ©ricos como de gusanos enjambres. Este modelo se usa en la SecciÃ³n 2.6 para describir la primera instancia de un gusano enjambre, Zachik. En la SecciÃ³n 4, se presentan resultados preliminares a travÃ©s de mediciones empÃ­ricas y simulaciÃ³n. Finalmente, en la SecciÃ³n 5 se presentan nuestras conclusiones e ideas sobre el trabajo futuro.2. Modelado de gusanos Para estudiar el comportamiento de los gusanos de enjambre En general, es necesario crear un modelo que refleje de manera realista la estructura de los gusanos y no necesariamente estÃ¡ vinculado a una instancia especÃ­fica. En esta secciÃ³n, describimos dicho modelo donde se describe que un gusano general tiene cuatro (4) componentes o subfunciones bÃ¡sicas. Por definiciÃ³n, un gusano es un programa autocontinido y autoproductivo. Por lo tanto, en tÃ©rminos simples, tiene dos funciones principales: lo que se propaga y lo que hace otras cosas. Proponemos que hay una tercera funcionalidad amplia de un gusano, la de la autoconservaciÃ³n. TambiÃ©n proponemos que la otra funcionalidad de un gusano puede clasificarse mÃ¡s apropiadamente como acciones basadas en objetivos (GBA), ya que cualquier funcionalidad incluida en un gusano dependerÃ¡ naturalmente de cualquier objetivo (y subggoals) que tenga el autor. El trabajo presentado por Weaver et.Alabama.En [5] nos proporciona principalmente una taxonomÃ­a basada en la acciÃ³n y la tÃ©cnica de los gusanos informÃ¡ticos, que utilizamos y extendemos aÃºn mÃ¡s aquÃ­.2.1 PropagaciÃ³n La funciÃ³n de propagaciÃ³n en sÃ­ misma puede descomponerse en tres acciones: adquirir el objetivo, enviar escaneo e infectar el objetivo. Adquirir el objetivo simplemente significa elegir un anfitriÃ³n para atacar a continuaciÃ³n. Enviar un escaneo implica verificar si ese host es receptivo a un intento de infecciÃ³n, ya que el espacio de IP estÃ¡ escasamente poblado. Esto puede implicar un ping simple para verificar si el host estÃ¡ vivo o una evaluaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidad completa. Infectar el objetivo es el mÃ©todo real utilizado para enviar el cÃ³digo de gusano al nuevo host. En el formulario de algoritmo: propagate () {host: = adquire_target () Ã©xito: = send_scan (host) if (Ã©xito) luego infectar (host) endif} en el caso de un gusano simple que no verifica si el host es esDisponible o susceptible (como Slammer), el mÃ©todo de escaneo se elimina: propagate () {host: = adquire_target () infect (host)} Cada una de estas acciones puede tener un costo asociado para su inclusiÃ³n y ejecuciÃ³n, como el mayor tamaÃ±o del gusanoy CPU o carga de red. Dependiendo de las necesidades o requisitos de los autores, estos se convierten en factores limitantes en lo que se puede incluir en las acciones de Worms. Esto se discute mÃ¡s a fondo despuÃ©s de expandir estas acciones a continuaciÃ³n.2.2 AdquisiciÃ³n de objetivos: la fase de adquisiciÃ³n objetivo de nuestro algoritmo de gusano se construye directamente a partir de la secciÃ³n de descubrimiento de objetivos en [5]. Weaver et.Alabama.Taxonomizar esta tarea en 5 categorÃ­as separadas. AquÃ­, ampliamos aÃºn mÃ¡s su trabajo a travÃ©s de la parametrizaciÃ³n. Escaneo: el escaneo puede considerarse un mÃ©todo basado en la ecuaciÃ³n para elegir un host. Se puede usar cualquier tipo de ecuaciÃ³n para llegar a una direcciÃ³n IP, pero hasta ahora hay tres tipos principales: preferencia secuencial, aleatoria y local. El escaneo secuencial es exactamente como suena: comience en una direcciÃ³n IP e incrementando a travÃ©s de todo el espacio IP. Esto podrÃ­a llevar consigo las opciones de las cuales IP para comenzar (valor elegido por el usuario, aleatorio o basado en IP de host infectado) y 324 cuÃ¡ntas veces se incrementan (valor continuo, elegido o basado en subred). El escaneo aleatorio estÃ¡ completamente al azar (dependiendo del mÃ©todo PRNG elegido y su valor de semilla). El escaneo de preferencias locales es una varianza de secuencial o aleatorio, por lo que tiene una mayor probabilidad de elegir una direcciÃ³n IP local sobre una remota (por ejemplo, la divisiÃ³n tradicional 80/20). Listas de objetivos previamente generados: las listas de objetivos previamente generadas, o las llamadas listas de golpes, podrÃ­an incluir las opciones para el porcentaje de poblaciÃ³n total y porcentaje incorrecto, o simplemente el nÃºmero de IP para incluir. ImplÃ­cito para este tipo estÃ¡ el hecho de que la lista se divide entre un padre y sus hijos, evitando el problema de cada instancia que alcanza exactamente las mismas mÃ¡quinas. Listas de destino generadas externamente: las listas de objetivos generadas externamente dependen de una o mÃ¡s fuentes externas que se puedan consultar para los datos del host. Esto involucrarÃ¡ a los servidores que normalmente estÃ¡n disponibles pÃºblicamente, como los meta-servidores de juegos o los que el autor o el autor de gusano o de gusano lo configuran explÃ­citamente. Los meta-servidores normalmente disponibles podrÃ­an tener parÃ¡metros para las tasas de cambio, como muchos aparecen por la noche o que se van por la maÃ±ana. Cada servidor tambiÃ©n podrÃ­a tener consultas mÃ¡ximas/segundo que podrÃ­a manejar. El gusano tambiÃ©n necesitarÃ­a una forma de encontrar estos servidores, ya sea dura o mediante escaneo. Listas de objetivos internos: las listas de objetivos internos dependen en gran medida del host infectado. Este mÃ©todo podrÃ­a parametrizar la elecciÃ³n de cuÃ¡nta informaciÃ³n estÃ¡ en el host, como todas las mÃ¡quinas en la subred, todas las cajas de Windows en la subred, servidores particulares, nÃºmero de interno/externo, o alguna combinaciÃ³n. Pasivo: los mÃ©todos pasivos estÃ¡n determinados por interacciones normales entre hosts. Los parÃ¡metros pueden incluir una tasa de interacciÃ³n con mÃ¡quinas particulares, tasa de interacciÃ³n interna/externa o tasa de interacciÃ³n basada en subred. Cualquiera de estos mÃ©todos tambiÃ©n se puede combinar para producir diferentes tipos de estrategias de adquisiciÃ³n de objetivos. Por ejemplo, el gusano A puede comenzar con una lista de golpes inicial de 100 hosts o subredes diferentes. Una vez que ha agotado su bÃºsqueda usando la lista de golpes, puede proceder a realizar escaneo aleatorio con un sesgo local del 50%. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que el consumo de recursos de cada mÃ©todo no es el mismo. Los diferentes mÃ©todos pueden requerir que el gusano sea grande, como los bytes adicionales requeridos por una lista de golpes, o que tomen mÃ¡s tiempo de procesamiento, como buscar en el host direcciones de otros hosts vulnerables. Se deben realizar mÃ¡s investigaciones y anÃ¡lisis en esta Ã¡rea para determinar los costos asociados para usar cada mÃ©todo. Los costos podrÃ­an usarse para determinar las compensaciones de diseÃ±o en las que participan los autores de gusanos. Por ejemplo, las listas de HIT proporcionan una alta tasa de infecciÃ³n, pero a un alto costo del tamaÃ±o de la carga Ãºtil de gusanos.2.2.1 Enviar un escaneo Las pruebas de la funciÃ³n de escaneo de envÃ­o para ver si el host estÃ¡ disponible para infecciÃ³n. Esto puede ser tan simple como verificar si el host estÃ¡ en la red o tan complejo como verificaciÃ³n si el host es vulnerable a la exploit que se utilizarÃ¡. El envÃ­o de un escaneo antes del intento de infecciÃ³n puede aumentar la tasa de escaneo si el costo por fallar una infecciÃ³n es mayor que el costo de fallar un escaneo o enviar un escaneo mÃ¡s infecciÃ³n;y las fallas son mÃ¡s frecuentes que los Ã©xitos. Un parÃ¡metro importante para esto serÃ­a la elecciÃ³n del protocolo de transporte (TCP/UDP) o simplemente el tiempo para un escaneo exitoso y el tiempo para un escaneo fallido. AdemÃ¡s, ya sea que pruebe o no para que el host estÃ© activo o si se trata de una prueba completa para la vulnerabilidad (o para mÃºltiples vulnerabilidades).2.2.2 Vector de infecciÃ³n (iv) El vector de infecciÃ³n particular utilizado para acceder al host remoto depende principalmente de la vulnerabilidad particular elegida para explotar. En un sentido no especÃ­fico, depende del protocolo de transporte elegido para usar y del tamaÃ±o del mensaje que se enviarÃ¡. La SecciÃ³n 3 de [5] tambiÃ©n propone tres clases particulares de IV: autocrutado, segundo canal e incrustado.2.3 Auto preservaciÃ³n Las acciones de auto -preservaciÃ³n de un gusano pueden tomar muchas formas. En la naturaleza, se ha observado que los gusanos deshabilitan el software antivirus o evitan que se envÃ­e a ciertas direcciones antivirus conocidas. TambiÃ©n se ha visto que intentan deshabilitar otros gusanos que pueden estar luchando por el mismo sistema. TambiÃ©n creemos que un escaneo acelerado basado en el tiempo puede ayudar al gusano a deslizarse bajo el radar. TambiÃ©n proponemos un mÃ©todo de seÃ±uelo, por el cual un gusano liberarÃ¡ a algunos niÃ±os que causan mucho ruido para que el padre no se note. TambiÃ©n se ha propuesto [5] que un gusano causa daÃ±o a su huÃ©sped si, y solo si, se altera de alguna manera. Este mÃ³dulo podrÃ­a contener parÃ¡metros para: probabilidad de Ã©xito en deshabilitar el antivirus u otras actualizaciones de software, la probabilidad de ser notado y, por lo tanto, eliminado, o endurecimiento del host contra otros gusanos.2.4 Acciones basadas en objetivos Una funcionalidad GBA de Worms depende de la lista de objetivos de los autores. La secciÃ³n de cargas Ãºtiles de [5] proporciona algunas sugerencias Ãºtiles para dicho mÃ³dulo. La apertura de una puerta trasera puede hacer que el anfitriÃ³n sea susceptible a mÃ¡s ataques. Esto implicarÃ­a una probabilidad de que se utilice la puerta trasera y cualquier utilizaciÃ³n del trÃ¡fico asociada. TambiÃ©n podrÃ­a proporcionar una lista de otros gusanos que este anfitriÃ³n ahora es susceptible o una lista de vulnerabilidades que ahora tiene este host. Los relÃ©s de spam y los proxis HTTP, por supuesto, tienen un consumo de ancho de banda asociado o un patrÃ³n de trÃ¡fico. Los ataques de DOS de Internet tendrÃ­an un tiempo establecido de activaciÃ³n, un objetivo y un patrÃ³n de trÃ¡fico. El daÃ±o de los datos tendrÃ­a una probabilidad asociada de que el host muera debido al daÃ±o. En la Figura 1, se resume este modelo general de un gusano. Tenga en cuenta que en este modelo no hay aprendizaje, ni muy poco, compartir informaciÃ³n entre instancias de gusanos, y ciertamente no hay coordinaciÃ³n de acciones. En la siguiente secciÃ³n expandimos el modelo para incluir tales mecanismos y, por lo tanto, llegamos al modelo general de un gusano enjambres.2.5 Swarms: modelo general como se describe en la SecciÃ³n 1, las caracterÃ­sticas bÃ¡sicas que distinguieron el comportamiento del enjambre de lo que parece ser comportamientos coordinados colectivos son cuatro atributos bÃ¡sicos. Estos son: 1. Simplicidad de lÃ³gica y acciones;2. Mecanismos de comunicaciÃ³n local;3. Control distribuido;y 4. Inteligencia emergente, incluida la autoorganizaciÃ³n.325 FUNCIÃN DE ESTRUCTURA/Ejemplo InfecciÃ³n, Infection Vector Ejecutable es ProtecciÃ³n de ejecuciÃ³n y sigiloso Deshabilitar McAfee (permanecer vivo) Enviar correo electrÃ³nico a todos en la acciÃ³n de la libreta de direcciones AcciÃ³n basada en objetivos (GBA) ddos www.sco.com Todo lo demÃ¡s, a menudo llamado carga Ãºtil Figura 1:Modelo de gusano general En este trabajo agregamos todos estos atributos bajo el tÃ­tulo general de aprendizaje, comunicaciÃ³n y control distribuido. La presencia de estos atributos distingue gusanos de enjambre de gusanos regulares u otros tipos de malware, como los zombis. En figura ??, El modelo genÃ©rico de un gusano se expande para incluir este conjunto de acciones. En este contexto, entonces, un gusano como Slammer no puede clasificarse como un gusano enjambre debido al hecho de que las nuevas instancias del gusano no coordinan sus acciones o comparten informaciÃ³n. Por otro lado, los zombis y muchas otras formas de DDoS, que a primera vista pueden considerar los gusanos de enjambre no lo son. Esto se debe simplemente al hecho de que en el caso de los zombis, el control no estÃ¡ distribuido sino mÃ¡s bien centralizado, y no surgen comportamientos emergentes. Este Ãºltimo, la apariciÃ³n potencial de inteligencia o nuevos comportamientos es lo que hace que los gusanos enjambres sean tan potencialmente peligrosos. Finalmente, cuando se considera la mayorÃ­a de las interrupciones recientes a la infraestructura de Internet, y a la luz de nuestra descripciÃ³n de los ataques de enjambre, las interrupciones pueden clasificarse fÃ¡cilmente como precursores para un comportamiento verdaderamente enjambre. EspecÃ­ficamente, â¢ DDoS: una gran cantidad de hosts comprometidos envÃ­an paquetes inÃºtiles que requieren procesamiento (Stacheldraht, http: //www.cert.org/ incidentNotes/in - 99 - 04.html). Los ataques DDoS son los primeros precursores de los ataques de enjambre debido a la gran cantidad de agentes involucrados.â¢ Code Red CRV1, Code Red II, NIMBDA: exhiben nociones tempranas de ataques de enjambre, incluido un canal de comunicaciÃ³n de puerta trasera.â¢ Staniford y Paxson en Â¿CÃ³mo ser dueÃ±o de Internet en su tiempo libre?Explore las modificaciones a CRV1, Code Red I, II con un tipo de comportamiento como enjambre. Por ejemplo, especulan en nuevos gusanos que emplean la comunicaciÃ³n directa de gusanos a gusanos y emplean actualizaciones programables. Por ejemplo, el gusano Warhol y los gusanos de escaneo de permutaciÃ³n (auto coordinaciÃ³n).2.6 Gusano de enjambre: Los detalles al considerar la creaciÃ³n de lo que creÃ­amos que era el primer gusano enjambre que existÃ­a, Â¿querÃ­amos adherirnos lo mÃ¡s cerca posible del modelo general presentado en la secciÃ³n??mientras que al mismo tiempo facilita el anÃ¡lisis a gran escala, tanto empÃ­rico como a travÃ©s de simulaciones, del comportamiento del enjambre. Por esta razÃ³n, seleccionamos como la funciÃ³n de estructura de primera instancia/ejemplo de infecciÃ³n, la infecciÃ³n por vectores de infecciÃ³n es la protecciÃ³n de ejecuciÃ³n y el sigilo Deshabilitar la propagaciÃ³n de McAfee (permanecer vivo) Enviar correo electrÃ³nico a todos en el aprendizaje de la libreta de direcciones, comunicaciÃ³n, feromonas/banderas (control y control distribuidoSi el gusano ya estÃ¡ presente) bombas de tiempo, algoritmos de aprendizaje, acciÃ³n de objetivos basado en objetivos del canal IRC (GBA) DDOS www.sco.com Todo lo demÃ¡s, a menudo llamado carga Ãºtil Figura 2: Modelo general de un gusano enjambre del enjambre Un gusano de agrietamiento de contraseÃ±a simple. El objetivo de este gusano simplemente es infectar un host intentando inicialmente iniciar sesiÃ³n en el host utilizando contraseÃ±as conocidas (ataque de diccionario), contraseÃ±as que cualquier miembro del Swarm y contraseÃ±as aleatorias han descubierto previamente. Una vez que un host estÃ¡ infectado, el gusano crearÃ¡ canales de comunicaciÃ³n con sus vecinos conocidos en ese momento, asÃ­ como con cualquier descripciÃ³n que genera con Ã©xito. En este contexto, una generaciÃ³n exitosa de una descendencia significa simplemente infectar un nuevo host y replicar una copia exacta de sÃ­ misma en dicho host. Llamamos a este gusano del enjambre el gusano zachik en honor a uno de sus creadores. Como se puede ver en esta descripciÃ³n, el gusano Zachik exhibe todos los elementos descritos antes. En las siguientes secciones, describimos en detalle cada uno de los elementos del gusano Zachik.2.7 Vector de infecciÃ³n El vector de infecciÃ³n utilizado para el gusano Zachik es el Protocolo de concha seguro SSH. Se escribiÃ³ un cliente modificado que es capaz de recibir contraseÃ±as de la lÃ­nea de comandos e integrado con un script que lo proporciona varias contraseÃ±as: conocido y aleatorio. Cuando se encuentra una contraseÃ±a para un objetivo apropiado, comienza el proceso de infecciÃ³n. DespuÃ©s de descubrir la contraseÃ±a de root de un host, el gusano infecta el host de destino y se replica. El gusano crea un nuevo directorio en el host de destino, copia el cliente SSH modificado, el script, los servidores de comunicaciones y las versiones actualizadas de los archivos de datos (lista de contraseÃ±as conocidas y una lista de vecinos actuales). Luego ejecuta el script modificado en los hosts reciÃ©n infectados, que generan el servidor de comunicaciones, notifica a los vecinos y comienza a buscar nuevos objetivos. Se podrÃ­a argumentar, correctamente, que el gusano Zachik puede ser fÃ¡cilmente derrotado por las tÃ©cnicas actuales de contramedidas presentes en la mayorÃ­a de los sistemas hoy en dÃ­a, como no permitir los inicios de raÃ­z directa de la red. Dentro de este contexto, Zachik puede descartarse rÃ¡pidamente como un gusano muy simple e inofensivo que no requiere mÃ¡s estudio. Sin embargo, el lector debe considerar lo siguiente: 1. Zachik se puede modificar fÃ¡cilmente para incluir una variedad de vectores de infecciÃ³n. Por ejemplo, podrÃ­a programarse para adivinar los nombres de usuario comunes y sus contraseÃ±as;Obtenga 326 acceso a un sistema, luego adivine la contraseÃ±a de root o use otras vulnerabilidades bien conocidas para obtener privilegios raÃ­z;2. Zachik es una prueba de gusano conceptual. La importancia de Zachik es que incorpora todos los comportamientos de un gusano enjambres, incluidos, pero no restringidos, control distribuido, comunicaciÃ³n entre agentes y aprendizaje;3. Zachik estÃ¡ compuesto por una gran colecciÃ³n de agentes que operan independientemente que se presta naturalmente a algoritmos paralelos, como una bÃºsqueda paralela del espacio de direcciones IPv4. Dentro de este contexto, Slammer, incorpora una capacidad de bÃºsqueda paralela de direcciones potencialmente susceptibles. Sin embargo, a diferencia de Zachik, el conocimiento descubierto por la bÃºsqueda nunca se comparte entre los agentes. Por estas razones, y muchas otras, uno no deberÃ­a descartar el potencial de esta nueva clase de gusanos, sino adoptar su estudio.2.8 Auto-conservaciÃ³n En el caso del gusano Zachik, las principales tÃ©cnicas de autoconservaciÃ³n utilizadas simplemente mantienen la carga Ãºtil pequeÃ±a. En este contexto, esto simplemente significa restringir el nÃºmero de contraseÃ±as que una descendencia hereda, disfrazando los mensajes de gusano como solicitudes HTTP comunes y restringir el nÃºmero de vecinos a un mÃ¡ximo de cinco (5).2.9 PropagaciÃ³n ElecciÃ³n del siguiente objetivo (s) en un asunto eficiente requiere pensamiento. En el pasado, los gusanos conocidos y propuestos, ver [5], han aplicado tÃ©cnicas de propagaciÃ³n que variaron. Estos incluyen: selecciÃ³n estrictamente aleatoria de un host vulnerable potencial;listas de objetivos de hosts vulnerables;selecciÃ³n aleatoria sesgada localmente (seleccione un objetivo de host al azar de una subred local);y una combinaciÃ³n de algunas o todas las anteriores. En nuestros entornos de prueba y simulaciÃ³n, aplicaremos una combinaciÃ³n de selecciÃ³n localmente sesgada y totalmente aleatoria de posibles hosts vulnerables. Sin embargo, debido al hecho de que el gusano Zachik es un gusano enjambre, el descubrimiento de direcciones (es decir, cuando se descubren direcciones inexistentes) se compartirÃ¡ la informaciÃ³n entre los miembros del enjambre. Los subprocesos de infecciÃ³n y propagaciÃ³n realizan el siguiente conjunto de actividades repetidamente: â¢ Elija una direcciÃ³n â¢ Verifique la validez de la direcciÃ³n â¢ Elija un conjunto de contraseÃ±as â¢ Intente infectar el host seleccionado con este conjunto de contraseÃ±as como se describe anteriormente, elegir una direcciÃ³n hace usode una combinaciÃ³n de selecciÃ³n aleatoria, sesgo local y listas de objetivos. EspecÃ­ficamente, para elegir una direcciÃ³n, la instancia puede: â¢ Generar una nueva direcciÃ³n aleatoria â¢ Generar una direcciÃ³n en la red local â¢ Elija una direcciÃ³n de una lista de transferencia.Dependencia de la propagaciÃ³n de elecciones particulares. La contraseÃ±a se elige de la lista de contraseÃ±as conocidas o reciÃ©n generadas. Cuando falla una infecciÃ³n de una direcciÃ³n vÃ¡lida, se agrega a una lista de transferencias, que se envÃ­a a los vecinos para tratar de trabajar.2.10 Aprendizaje, ComunicaciÃ³n y distribuida Control 2.10.1 ComunicaciÃ³n El concepto de un enjambre se basa en la transferencia de informaciÃ³n entre los vecinos, que transmiten sus nuevos mensajes entrantes a sus vecinos, y asÃ­ sucesivamente hasta que cada instancia de gusano en el enjambre sea consciente de estos mensajes. Hay dos clases de mensajes: datos o mensajes de informaciÃ³n y comandos. Los mensajes de comando estÃ¡n destinados a un usuario externo (tambiÃ©n conocido como hackers y/o galletas salientes) para controlar las acciones de las instancias, y actualmente no se implementan. Los mensajes de informaciÃ³n son actualmente de tres tipos: nuevo miembro, contraseÃ±as y direcciones explotables (transferencias). Los nuevos mensajes de los miembros son mensajes que una nueva instancia envÃ­a a los vecinos en su lista (corta) de vecinos iniciales. Los vecinos luego registran estas instancias en su lista de vecinos. Estos son mensajes que forman la mÃºltiple conexiÃ³n del enjambre, y sin ellos, la topologÃ­a serÃ¡ una estructura de alojamiento, donde eliminar un solo nodo causarÃ­a que las instancias debajo de Ã©l sean inaccesibles. Los mensajes de contraseÃ±as informan instancias de contraseÃ±as reciÃ©n descubiertas, e informando todas las instancias, el enjambre como total recopila esta informaciÃ³n, lo que le permite infectar nuevas instancias de manera mÃ¡s efectiva. Los mensajes de transferencia informan instancias de direcciones vÃ¡lidas que no podrÃ­an verse comprometidas (falle en romper la contraseÃ±a para la cuenta raÃ­z). Dado que el espacio de direcciones es bastante escaso, lleva un tiempo relativamente largo (es decir, muchas pruebas) para descubrir una direcciÃ³n vÃ¡lida. Por lo tanto, al entregar direcciones vÃ¡lidas descubiertas, el enjambre (a) conserva la energÃ­a al no volver a descubrir las mismas direcciones (b) atacar de manera mÃ¡s efectiva. En cierto modo, esta es una instancia simple de actividad coordinada de un enjambre.2.10.2 CoordinaciÃ³n Cuando nace una instancia de gusano, transmite su existencia a todos los vecinos en su lista. El hilo principal luego genera algunos hilos de infecciÃ³n y continÃºa manejando los mensajes entrantes (registrando vecinos, agregando nuevas contraseÃ±as, recibiendo direcciones y transmitiendo estos mensajes).2.10.3 Control distribuido El control en el gusano Zachik se distribuye en el sentido de que cada instancia del gusano realiza un conjunto de acciones independientemente de cualquier otra instancia y, al mismo tiempo, se beneficia del aprendizaje alcanzado por sus vecinos inmediatos.2.11 Acciones basadas en objetivos La primera instanciaciÃ³n del gusano Zachik tiene dos objetivos bÃ¡sicos. Estos son: (1) propagarse y (2) descubrir y compartir con los miembros de las nuevas contraseÃ±as de root en el enjambre.3. DiseÃ±o experimental Para verificar nuestra hipÃ³tesis de que los gusanos de enjambre son mÃ¡s capaces y, por lo tanto, peligrosos que otros 327 gusanos conocidos, se creÃ³ una prueba de red y se creÃ³ un simulador, capaz de simular topologÃ­as similares a Internet (espacio IPv4),desarrollado. La red de redes consistiÃ³ en una red de Ã¡rea local de 30 computadoras basadas en Linux. El simulador fue escrito en C ++. El simple gusano de enjambre descrito en la SecciÃ³n 2.6 se usÃ³ para infectar al paciente-cero, y luego se permitiÃ³ que el gusano enjambre se propagara a travÃ©s de sus propios mecanismos de propagaciÃ³n, control distribuido y comportamientos de enjambre. En el caso de una red de Ã¡rea local simple de 30 computadoras, se seleccionaron seis (6) contraseÃ±as de raÃ­z diferentes de un espacio de contraseÃ±a de 4 dÃ­gitos (10000 opciones). Al comienzo del experimento, se conoce una Ãºnica contraseÃ±a conocida, la del paciente-cero. Todas las contraseÃ±as compartidas se distribuyen al azar en todos los nodos. Del mismo modo, en el caso de la simulaciÃ³n, se construyÃ³ una topologÃ­a de red de 10,000 hosts, cuyas direcciones se seleccionaron aleatoriamente a travÃ©s del espacio IPv4. Dentro de ese espacio, se seleccionaron y se distribuyeron un total de 200 contraseÃ±as compartidas y se distribuyeron al azar y/o dirigidas a subredes de topologÃ­as de red especÃ­ficas. Por ejemplo, en una de nuestras ejecuciones de simulaciÃ³n, la topologÃ­a de la red consistiÃ³ en 200 subredes cada una que contenÃ­a 50 hosts. En tal topologÃ­a, las contraseÃ±as compartidas se distribuyeron en subredes donde se compartiÃ³ un porcentaje variable de contraseÃ±as en las subredes. Los porcentajes de contraseÃ±as compartidas utilizadas reflejaron los primeros estudios empÃ­ricos, donde se descubriÃ³ que hasta el 39.7% de las contraseÃ±as comunes se compartÃ­an.4. Resultados en la Figura 3, se presentan los resultados que comparan el comportamiento de ataque de enjambre versus el de un gusano malformado tÃ­pico para una LAN de 30 nodos. En este conjunto de ejecuciones empÃ­ricas, seis (6) contraseÃ±as compartidas se distribuyeron al azar en todos los nodos de una posible de 10,000 contraseÃ±as desconocidas. Los datos presentados reflejan los comportamientos de un total de tres (3) clases distintas de gusanos o gusanos de enjambre. La clase de gusanos presentados son las siguientes: â¢ I-NS-NL: = Generic Worm, Independent (I), sin aprendizaje/Memoria (NL) y sin compartir informaciÃ³n con vecinos o descendientes (NS);â¢ S-L-S-SP: = gusano Swarm (s), aprendizaje (L), mantiene la lista de contraseÃ±as aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseÃ±as (SP) en los vecinos y descendientes mÃ¡s cercanos;y â¢ S-L-SP&A: = WeMm Worm (s), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseÃ±as aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseÃ±as y direcciones existentes (SP&A) en los vecinos y descendientes mÃ¡s cercanos. Como se muestra en la Figura 3, los resultados validan nuestra hipÃ³tesis original de que los gusanos enjambres son significativamente mÃ¡s eficientes y peligrosos que los gusanos genÃ©ricos. En este conjunto de experimentos, el intercambio de contraseÃ±as proporciona un orden de mejora de magnitud sobre un gusano aleatorio sin memoria. Del mismo modo, un gusano enjambre que comparte contraseÃ±as y direcciones es aproximadamente dos Ã³rdenes de magnitud mÃ¡s eficiente que su contraparte genÃ©rica. En la Figura 3, se puede observar una serie de discontinuidades. Estas discontinuidades son un artefacto del pequeÃ±o espacio de muestra utilizado para este experimento. BÃ¡sicamente, tan pronto como se rompe una contraseÃ±a, todos los nodos que comparten esa contraseÃ±a especÃ­fica se infectan en unos pocos segundos. Tenga en cuenta que es trivial que un gusano enjambre escanee y descubra un pequeÃ±o espacio de contraseÃ±a compartida. En la Figura 4, se presentan los resultados de la simulaciÃ³n que comparan el comportamiento del ataque del enjambre versus el de un gusano malformado genÃ©rico. En este conjunto de ejecuciones de simulaciÃ³n, se construyÃ³ una topologÃ­a de red de 10,000 hosts, cuyas direcciones se seleccionaron aleatoriamente a travÃ©s del espacio IPv4. Dentro de ese espacio, se seleccionaron y se distribuyeron un total de 200 contraseÃ±as compartidas y se distribuyeron al azar y/o dirigidas a subredes de topologÃ­as de red especÃ­ficas. Los datos presentados reflejan los comportamientos de tres (3) clases distintas de gusanos de gusanos o enjambres y dos (2) estrategias de escaneo de selecciÃ³n de host objetivo diferente (escaneo aleatorio y sesgo local). La cantidad de sesgo local se variÃ³ en mÃºltiples ejecuciones de simulaciÃ³n. Los resultados presentados son comportamientos agregados. En general, se simularon la siguiente clase de gusanos genÃ©ricos y gusanos de enjambre. Escaneo de direcciones: â¢ aleatorias: = Las direcciones se seleccionan al azar desde un subconjunto del espacio IPv4, a saber, un espacio de direcciones 224;y â¢ Sesgo local: = Las direcciones se seleccionan al azar desde una subred local (256 direcciones) o desde un subconjunto del espacio IPv4, a saber, un espacio de direcciones 224. El porcentaje de sesgo local varÃ­a en mÃºltiples ejecuciones. Aprendizaje, comunicaciÃ³n y control distribuido â¢ I-NL-NS: gusano genÃ©rico, independiente (i), sin aprendizaje/ memoria (NL) y sin compartir informaciÃ³n con vecinos o descendientes (NS);â¢ I-L-OO: gusano genÃ©rico, independiente (i), aprendizaje/ sin memoria (l) y una vez compartiendo informaciÃ³n con descuentos solo (OOS);â¢ S-L-S-SP: = gusano Swarm (s), aprendizaje (L), mantiene la lista de contraseÃ±as aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseÃ±as (SP) en los vecinos y descendientes mÃ¡s cercanos;â¢ S-L-S & AOP: = Swarm Worm (s), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseÃ±as aprendidas y el intercambio de direcciones con vecinos y descendientes, comparte contraseÃ±as solo una vez (en la creaciÃ³n) con descendientes (SA & OP);â¢ S-L-SP & A: = Swarm Worm (S), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseÃ±as aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseÃ±as y direcciones existentes (SP&A) en los vecinos y descendientes mÃ¡s cercanos. Como se muestra en la Figura 4, los resultados son consistentes con nuestro conjunto de resultados empÃ­ricos. AdemÃ¡s, se pueden hacer las siguientes observaciones.1. La preferencia local es increÃ­blemente efectiva.2. Las transferencias de direcciones cortas son mÃ¡s efectivas que las largas. Variamos el tamaÃ±o de la lista permitida en el intercambio de direcciones;La sobrecarga asociada con una larga lista de direcciones es perjudicial para el rendimiento del gusano del enjambre, asÃ­ como para su sigilo;3. Para el caso de sesgo local, compartir direcciones vÃ¡lidas de anfitriÃ³n susceptible, S-L-S & AOP Worm (retiro, el S-S-S & AOP Swarm que comparte contraseÃ±as, una sola vez, con Offsprings 328 en el momento de la creaciÃ³n) es mÃ¡s efectivo que compartir contraseÃ±as en caso de queSwarm de S-L-S-SP. En este caso, podemos pensar en el enjambre como lanzar un ataque DistributedDictionary: diferentes segmentos del enjambre usan diferentes contraseÃ±as para tratar de entrar en el host no infectado susceptible. En el modo de sesgo local, al principio de la vida del enjambre, el intercambio de direcciones es mÃ¡s efectivo que el intercambio de contraseÃ±as, hasta que se descubren la mayorÃ­a de las subredes. Luego, la orientaciÃ³n de las direcciones locales ayuda a descubrir los hosts susceptibles, mientras que los miembros del enjambre deben perder el tiempo redescubriendo las contraseÃ±as;y 4. Infectar el Ãºltimo 0.5% de los nodos lleva mucho tiempo en modo de sesgo no local. BÃ¡sicamente, la lista de contraseÃ±as compartidas en las subredes se ha agotado, y el enjambre vuelve a un descubrimiento aleatorio del algoritmo de contraseÃ±a.

Resumen y trabajo futuro En este manuscrito, hemos presentado un modelo abstracto, similar en algunos aspectos al de Weaver [5], que ayuda a explicar la naturaleza genÃ©rica de los gusanos. El modelo presentado en la SecciÃ³n 2 se extendiÃ³ para incorporar una nueva clase de gusanos potencialmente peligrosos llamados gusanos de enjambre. Los gusanos de enjambre se comportan mucho como enjambres biolÃ³gicos y exhiben un alto grado de aprendizaje, comunicaciÃ³n e inteligencia distribuida. Tales gusanos enjambres son potencialmente mÃ¡s daÃ±inos que sus contrapartes genÃ©ricas. AdemÃ¡s, se creÃ³ la primera instancia, hasta donde sabemos, de este gusano de aprendizaje, llamado Zachik. Zachik es un gusano de enjambre de crujido de contraseÃ±a simple que incorpora diferentes estrategias de aprendizaje e intercambio de informaciÃ³n. Tal gusano de enjambre se implementÃ³ tanto en una red de Ã¡rea local de treinta (30) hosts, asÃ­ como se simulÃ³ en una topologÃ­a de 10,000 nodos. Los resultados preliminares mostraron que tales gusanos son capaces de comprometer los hosts a tasas de hasta 2 Ã³rdenes de magnitud mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido que su contraparte genÃ©rica mientras retiene las capacidades de sigilo. Este trabajo abre una nueva Ã¡rea de problemas interesantes. Algunos de los problemas mÃ¡s interesantes y apremiantes a considerar son los siguientes: â¢ Â¿Es posible aplicar algunos de los conceptos de aprendizaje desarrollados en los Ãºltimos diez aÃ±os en las Ã¡reas de inteligencia de enjambre, sistemas de agentes y control distribuido al diseÃ±o de enjambres sofisticadosÂ¿Los gusanos de tal manera que tiene lugar el verdadero comportamiento emergente?â¢ Â¿Las tÃ©cnicas actuales se desarrollan en el diseÃ±o de sistemas de detecciÃ³n de intrusos y contramedidas y sistemas sobrevivibles efectivos contra esta nueva clase de gusanos?;y â¢ Â¿QuÃ© tÃ©cnicas, si alguna, se pueden desarrollar para crear defensas contra gusanos enjambres?6. Agradecimientos Este trabajo se realizÃ³ como parte de un mayor esfuerzo en el desarrollo de los sistemas de detecciÃ³n de intrusos y contramedidas de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n en WSSRL.

        "Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights into future work are presented. 2.",
        "WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance.",
        "In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions.",
        "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
        "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
        "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
        "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
        "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
        "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
        "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
        "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
        "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
        "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
        "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
        "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
        "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
        "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
        "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
        "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
        "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
        "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
        "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
        "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
        "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
        "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
        "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
        "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
        "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
        "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
        "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
        "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
        "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
        "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
        "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
        "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
        "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
        "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
        "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
        "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
        "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
        "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
        "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
        "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
        "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
        "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
        "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
        "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
        "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
        "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
        "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
        "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
        "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
        "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
        "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
        "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
        "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
        "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
        "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
        "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
        "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
        "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
        "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
        "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
        "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",
        "These are: 1.",
        "Simplicity of logic & actions; 2.",
        "Local Communication Mechanisms; 3.",

        "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
        "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
        "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
        "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",

        "The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords.",
        "Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates.",
        "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
        "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
        "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
        "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
        "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
        "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
        "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
        "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
        "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
        "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
        "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
        "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
        "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
        "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
        "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
        "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
        "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
        "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
        "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
        "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
        "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
        "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
        "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
        "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
        "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
        "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
        "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
        "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
        "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
        "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
        "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
        "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
        "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
        "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
        "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
        "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
        "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
        "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
        "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
        "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
        "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
        "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",
        "The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.",
        "The simulator was written in C++ .",
        "The simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors.",
        "In the case of a simple local area network of 30 computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.",
        "At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero.",
        "All shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes.",
        "Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.",
        "Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.",
        "For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts.",
        "In such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets.",
        "The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 4.",
        "RESULTS In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented.",
        "In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.",
        "The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.",
        "The class of worms presented are as follows: â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",
        "As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms.",
        "In this set of experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm.",
        "Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.",
        "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
        "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
        "Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.",
        "Note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password space.",
        "In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are presented.",
        "In this set of simulation runs, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.",
        "Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.",
        "The data presented reflects the behaviors of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies (random scanning and local bias).",
        "The amount of local bias was varied across multiple simulation runs.",
        "The results presented are aggregate behaviors.",
        "In general the following class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated.",
        "Address Scanning: â¢ Random:= addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space; and â¢ Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space.",
        "The percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs.",
        "Learning, Communication & Distributed Control â¢ I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/ memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/ memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information with offsprings only (OOS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; â¢ S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP); â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",
        "As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with our set of empirical results.",
        "In addition, the following observations can be made. 1.",
        "Local preference is incredibly effective. 2.",
        "Short address handoffs are more effective than long ones.",
        "We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.",
        "For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm.",
        "In this case, we can think of the swarm as launching a distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use different passwords to try to break into susceptible uninfected host.",
        "In the local bias mode, early in the life of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered.",
        "Then the targeting of local addresses assists in discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and 4.",
        "Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time in non-local bias mode.",
        "Basically, the shared password list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm reverts to simply a random discovery of password algorithm.",

                "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
                "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
                "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",
                "These are: 1.",
                "Simplicity of logic & actions; 2.",
                "Local Communication Mechanisms; 3.",
                "Distributed control; and 4.",

                "The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of <br>malware</br> such as Zombies.",
                "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
                "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",
                "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
                "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
                "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
                "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",
                "Specifically, â¢ DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN â 99 â 04.html).",
                "DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm Attacks due to the large number of agents involved. â¢ Code Red CrV1, Code Red II, Nimbda - Exhibit early notions of swarm attacks, including a backdoor communication channel. â¢ Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1, Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of behavior.",
                "For example, they speculate on new worms which employ direct worm-to-worm communication, and employ programmable updates.",

                "The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords.",
                "Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates.",
                "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
                "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",
                "The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.",
                "The simulator was written in C++ .",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",

                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",

                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",

                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a <br>swarm worm</br> including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a <br>swarm worm</br>, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.",
                "The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.",
                "The class of worms presented are as follows: â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ S-L-SP:= <br>swarm worm</br> (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and â¢ S-L-SP&A:= <br>swarm worm</br> (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",

                "Similarly, a <br>swarm worm</br> that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.",
                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
                "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
                "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",

                "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
                "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
                "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",

                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",
                "The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.",
                "The simulator was written in C++ .",
                "The simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors.",
                "In the case of a simple local area network of 30 computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.",

                "Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.",
                "Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.",
                "For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts.",
                "In such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets.",
                "The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 4.",
                "RESULTS In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented.",
                "In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.",
                "The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.",
                "The class of worms presented are as follows: â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",
                "As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms.",
                "In this set of experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm.",
                "Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.",
                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
                "Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.",

                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",

                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",

                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",

                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",

                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.",
                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
                "Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.",

                "<br>zachik</br> is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike <br>zachik</br>, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of <br>zachik</br> worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the <br>zachik</br> worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",

                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the <br>zachik</br> worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the <br>zachik</br> worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",

                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",

                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",

                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",

                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.",
                "The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.",
                "The class of worms presented are as follows: â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",

                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",

                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",

                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",

                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",

                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",

                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",

                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",

                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",

                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",

                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",

                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: â¢ Choose an address â¢ Check the validity of the address â¢ Choose a set of passwords â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: â¢ Generate a new random address â¢ Generate an address on the local network â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
