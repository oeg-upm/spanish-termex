We devise a general framework for the study of mechanism design in single-parameter environments with restricted action spaces. Our contribution is threefold. First, we characterize sufficient conditions under which the information-theoretically optimal social-choice rule can be implemented in dominant strategies, and prove that any multilinear social-choice rule is dominant-strategy implementable with no additional cost. Second, we identify necessary conditions for the optimality of action-bounded mechanisms, and fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in games with two players and two alternatives. Finally, we prove that for any multilinear social-choice rule, the optimal mechanism with k actions incurs an expected loss of O( 1 k2 ) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted action spaces. Our results apply to various economic and computational settings, and we demonstrate their applicability to signaling games, public-good models and routing in networks.

INTRODUCTION Mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable outcomes, when the players are rational. In a standard setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to maximize their utilities. The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative. For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost. Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space. This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15]. Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power. Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information. In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies. There are various reasons for such strict restrictions on the action spaces. In some situations, firms are not willing, or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for some product or service. The buyers in such environemnts face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they may have an infinite number of possible values for the item. In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial information about them. For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions. Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12]. Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge. The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge. The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits exceeds the construction cost of the bridge. The social planner cannot access the private data of the players, and can only learn about it from the players actions. When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built. Assume now that the players cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1). Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages. In this work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence of such restrictions. Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were studied in several earlier papers. The work of Blumrosen, Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper. They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed to send messages with severely bounded size. They characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space. Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14]. Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models. We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space). A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative. A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types. However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints. That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types. The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}. Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative. Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods. A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks. Consider a network that is composed of two links in parallel. Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully. A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network. That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions. Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most. The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions. We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval. The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value? Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions. The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous). The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium. These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium? And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result? What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].) Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies. We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost. Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies. Multilinear social-value functions capture many important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare function in which the players valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions). The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility. To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero. We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies. Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms. We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives. The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions). We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers. Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism. We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4]. Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions. Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers. Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder. To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature. One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist. Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted. For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ). This result is achieved in dominant strategies. Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ). This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5]. Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A). However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible. Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications. First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions. We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire. This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD). Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates. The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2. We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss. In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative. In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models. Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors web pages. 2. MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES We first describe a standard mechanism-design model for players with one-dimensional types. Then, in Subsection 2.2, we impose limitation on the action space. The general model studies environments with n players and a set A = {A1, A2, ..., Am} of m alternatives. Each player has a privately known type θi ∈ [θi, θi] (where θi, θi ∈ R, θi < θi), and a type-dependent valuation function vi(θi, A) for each alternative A ∈ A. In other words, player i with type θi is willing to pay an amount of vi(θi, A) for alternative A to be chosen. Each type θi is independently distributed according to a publicly known distribution Fi, with an always positive density function fi. We denote the set of all possible type profiles by Θ = ×n i=1[θi, θi]. 64 The social planner has a social-choice function c : Θ → A, where the choice of alternatives is made in order to maximize a social-value function g( −→ θ ) : Θ × A → R. That is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxA∈A{g( −→ θ , A)} We assume that for every alternative A ∈ A, the function g(·, A) is continuous and differentiable in every type. Since the players types are private information, in order to choose the optimal alternative, the social planner needs to get the players types as an input. The players reveal information about their types by choosing an action, from an action set B. Each player uses a strategy for determining the action he plays for any possible type. A strategy for player i is therefore a function si : [θi, θi] −→ B. We denote a profile of strategies by s = s1, ..., sn and the set of the strategies of all players except i by s−i. The utility of player i of type θi from alternative A under the payment pi is ui = vi(θi, A) − pi. 2.1 Dominant-Strategy Implementation Following is a standard definition of a mechanism. The action space B is traditionally implicit, but we mention it explicitly since we later examine limitations on B. Definition 1. A mechanism with an action set B is a pair (t, p) where: • t : Bn → A is the allocation rule.2 • p : Bn → Rn is the payment scheme (i.e., pi(b) is the payment to the ith player given a vector of actions b). The main goal of this paper is to optimize the expected social value (in action-bounded mechanisms) while preserving a dominant-strategy equilibrium. We say that a strategy si is dominant for player i in mechanism (t, p) if player i cannot increase his utility by reporting a different action than si(θi), regardless of the actions of the other players b−i.3 Definition 2. We say that a social-choice function h is implementable with a set of actions B if there exists a mechanism (t, p) with a dominant-strategy equilibrium s1, ..., sn (where for each i, si : [θi, θi] −→ B) that always chooses an alternative according to h, i.e., t(s1(θ1), ..., sn(θn)) = h( −→ θ ). A fundamental result in the mechanism-design literature states that under the single-crossing condition, the monotonicity of the social-choice function is a sufficient and necessary condition for dominant-strategy implementability (in single-parameter environments). The single-crossing condition (also known as the Spence-Mirrlees condition) appears, very often implicitly, in almost every paper on mechanism design in one-dimensional domains. Without this assumption, general sufficient condition for implementability are unknown (for a survey on this topic see [10]). Throughout this paper, we assume that the valuation functions of the players are single-crossing, as defined below. A players valuation function will be single-crossing if the effect of an increment in the players type on the players valuation for 2 We will show that, w.l.o.g., we can focus on deterministic allocation schemes. 3 That is, for every type θi and every action bi, we have that vi ( θi, t(si(θi), b−i) )-pi(si(θi), b−i)¿vi ( θi, t(bi, b−i) )pi(bi, b−i) two alternatives is always greater for one of these alternatives. The single-crossing condition on the players preferences actually defines an order on the alternatives. For example, if the value of player i for alternative A increases more rapidly than his value for alternative B, we can denote it by A i B. Later on, we will use these orders for defining monotonicity of social-choice functions. Definition 3. A function h : Θ × A → R is single crossing with respect to i if there is a weak order i on the alternatives, such that for any two alternatives Aj i Al we have that for every −→ θ ∈ Θ, ∂h( −→ θ , Aj ) ∂θi > ∂h( −→ θ , Al) ∂θi and if Aj ∼ Al (that is, Al i Aj and Aj i Al) then h(·, Aj) ≡ h(·, Al) (i.e., the functions are identical). The definition of monotone social-choice functions also requires an order on the actions. This order is implicit in most of the standard settings where, for example, it is defined by the order on the real numbers (e.g., in direct revelation mechanisms where each type is drawn from a real interval). When the action space is discrete, the order can be determined by the names of the actions, for example, 0, 1,...,k-1 for k-action mechanisms. (We therefore describe this order with the standard relation on natural numbers <, >.) Definition 4. A deterministic mechanism is monotone if when player i raises his reported action, and fixing the actions of the other players, the mechanism never chooses an inferior alternative for i. That is, for any b−i ∈ {0, ..., k− 1}n−1 if bi > bi then t(bi, b−i) i t(bi, b−i). Following is a classic result regarding the implementability of social-choice functions in single-parameter environments. Note, however, that this characterization does not hold when the action space is bounded. Proposition 1. Assume that the valuation functions vi(θi, A) are single crossing and that the action space is unrestricted. A social-choice function c is dominant-strategy implementable if and only if c is monotone. 2.2 Action-Bounded Mechanisms The set of actions B is usually implicit in the literature, and it is assumed to be isomorphic to the type space. In this paper, we study environments where this assumption does not hold. We define a k-action game to be a game in which the number of possible actions for each player is k, i.e., |B| = k. In k-action games, the social planner typically cannot always choose an alternative according to the social choice function c due to the informational constraints. Instead, we are interested in implementing a social-choice function that, with k actions, maximizes the expected social value: E−→ θ g −→ θ , t (s1(θ1), ..., sn(θn)) . Definition 5. We say that a social-choice function h : Θ → A is informationally achievable with a set of actions B if there exists a profile of strategies s1, ..., sn (where for each i, si : [θi, θi] −→ B), and an allocation rule t : Bn → A, such that t chooses the same alternative as h for any type profile, i.e., t(s1(θ1), ..., t(θn)) = h( −→ θ ). If |B| = k, we say that h is k-action informationally achievable. 65 Note that this definition does not take into account strategic considerations. For example, consider an environment with two alternatives A = {A, B}, and the following socialchoice function: ec(θ1, θ2) = A iff {θ1 > 1/2 and θ2 > 1/2}. ec is informationally achievable with two actions: if both players bid 0 when their value is greater than 1/2 and 1 otherwise, then the allocation rule choose alternative A iff both players report 1 derives exactly the same allocation for every profile of types. In contrast, it is easy to see that the function ˆc(θ1, θ2) = A iff θ1 + θ2 > 1/2 is not informationally achievable with two actions. We now define a social-choice rule that maximizes the social value under the information-theoretic constraints that are implied by the limitations on the number of actions. Definition 6. A social-choice function is k-action informationally optimal with respect to the social-value function g, if it achieves the maximal expected social value among all the k-action informationally achievable social-choice functions.4 Earlier in this section, we defined the single-crossing property for the players valuations. We now define a singlecrossing property on the social-value function g. This property clearly ensures the monotonicity of the corresponding social choice rule, and we will later show that it is also useful for action-bounded environments. Definition 7. We say that the social-choice rule g( −→ θ , A) exhibits the single-crossing property if for every player i, g exhibits the single-crossing property with respect to i. Note that the definition above requires that g will be single crossing with respect to every player i, given her individual order i on the alternatives. That is, the social value function g will be compatible in this sense with the singlecrossing conditions on the players preferences. Finally, we call attention to a natural set of strategies - non-decreasing strategies, where each player reports a higher action as her type increases. Equivalently, such strategies are threshold strategies - strategies where each player divides his type support into intervals, and simply reports the interval in which her type lies. Definition 8. A real vector x = (x0, x1, ..., xk) is a vector of threshold values if x0 ≤ x1 ≤ ... ≤ xk. Definition 9. A strategy si is a threshold strategy based on a vector of threshold values x = (x0, x1, ..., xk), if for any action j it holds that si(θi) = j iff θi ∈ [xj , xj+1]. A strategy si is called a threshold strategy, if there exists a vector x of threshold values such that si is a threshold strategy based on x. 3. IMPLEMENTATION WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF ACTIONS In this section, we study the general model of actionbounded mechanism design. Our first result is a sufficient and necessary condition for the implementability of the optimal solution achievable with k actions: this condition says that the optimal social-choice rule is achieved when all the 4 For simplicity, we assume that a maximum is attained and thus the optimal function is well defined. players use non-decreasing strategies. The basic idea is that with non-decreasing strategies (i.e., threshold strategies), we can apply the single-crossing property to show that when a player raises his reported action, the expected value for his high-priority alternatives increases faster; therefore, monotonicity must hold. The result holds for any number of players and alternatives, and for any profile of distribution functions on the players types, as long as they are statistically independent. (It is easy to illustrate that this result does not hold if the players types are dependent.) Lemma 1. Consider a single-crossing social-value function g. The informationally optimal k-action social-choice function c∗ (with respect to g) is implementable if and only if c∗ achieves its optimum when the players use non-decreasing strategies. Next, we show that for a wide family of social-value functions - multilinear functions - the price of implementation is zero. That is, the information-theoretically optimal rule is dominant-strategy implementable. This family of functions captures many common settings from the literature. In particular, it generalizes the auction setting studied by Blumrosen et al. [4, 6]. Definition 10. A multilinear function is a polynomial in which the degree of every variable in each monomial is at most 1.5 We say that a social-choice rule g is multilinear, if g(·, A) is multilinear for every alternative A ∈ A. The basic idea behind the proof of the following theorem is as follows: for every player, we show that the expected social welfare when he chooses any action (fixing the strategies of the other players) is a linear function of his type. This is a result of the multilinearity of the social-value function and of the linearity of expectation. The maximum over a set of linear functions is a piecewise-linear function, hence the optimal social value is achieved when the player uses threshold strategies (the thresholds are the switching points). Since the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies, we can apply Lemma 1 to show the monotonicity of this socialchoice rule. Note that in this argument we characterize the players strategies that maximize the social value, and not the players utilities. Theorem 1. If the social-value function is multilinear and single crossing, the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function is implementable. Proof. We will show that for any k-action mechanism, the optimal expected social value is achieved when all players use threshold strategies. This will be shown by proving that for any player i and for any action bi of player i, the expected welfare when she chooses the action bi is a linear function in player is type θi. Then, it will follow from Lemma 1 that the social choice function is implementable. For every action bi of player i, let qA denote the probability that alternative A is allocated, i.e., qA = Pr−→ θ h t(s( −→ θ )) = A|si(θi) = bi i 5 For example, f(x, y, z) = xyz + 5xy + 7. 66 Due to the linearity of expectation, the expected social value when player i with type θi reports bi is: X A∈A qA Eθ−i ( g(θi, θ−i, A) | t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A ) (1) = X A∈A qA Z θ−i g(θi, θ−i, A)fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) (2) where fA −i(θ−i) equals Q j=i fj (θj ) qA for types profiles θ−i such that t(bi, s−i(θ−i)) = A, and 0 otherwise. Since g is multilinear, every function g(θi, θ−i, A) is a linear function in θi, where the coefficients depend on the values of θ−i. Denote this function by g(θi, θ−i, A) = λθ−i θi + βθ−i . Thus, we can write Equation 2 as: X A∈A qA Z θ−i ` λθ−i θi + βθ−i ´ fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) = X A∈A qA θi Z θ−i λθ−i fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) + Z θ−i βθ−i fA −i(θ−i)d(θ−i) ! In this expression, each integral is a constant independent of θi when the strategies of the other player are fixed. Therefore, each summand, thus the whole function, is a linear function in θi. For achieving the optimal expected social value, the player must choose the action that maximizes the expected social value. A maximum of k linear functions is a piecewise-linear function with at most k−1 breaking points. These breaking points are the thresholds to be used by the player. For all types between subsequent thresholds, the optimum is clearly achieved by a single action; Since linear functions are single-crossing, every action will be maximal in at most one interval. The same argument applies to all the players, and therefore the optimal social value is obtained with threshold strategies. Observe that the proof of Theorem 1 actually works for a more general setting. For proving that the informationtheoretically optimal result is achieved with threshold strategies, it is sufficient to show that the social-choice function exhibits a single-crossing condition on expectation: given any allocation scheme, and fixing the behavior of the other players, the expected social value in any two actions (as a function of θi) is single crossing. Theorem 1 shows that this requirement holds for multilinear functions, but we were not able to give an exact characterization of this general class of functions. The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal solution makes the characterization of the optimal incentive-compatible mechanisms significantly easier: we can apply the standard mechanism-design technique and first calculate the optimal allocation scheme and then find the right payments. Observe that if the valuation functions of the players are linear and single crossing, then the social-welfare function (i.e., the sum of the players valuations) is multilinear and single-crossing. This holds since the single-crossing conditions on the valuations are defined with a similar order on the alternatives as in the social-value function. Therefore, an immediate conclusion from Theorem 1 is that the optimal social welfare, which is achievable with k actions, is implementable when the valuations are linear. Corollary 1. If the valuation functions vi(·, A) are single crossing and linear in θi for every player i and for every alternative, then the informationally optimal k-action social welfare function is implementable. 3.1 Asymptotic Analysis In this section we show that the social value loss of multilinear social-value rules diminishes quadratically with the number of possible actions, k. This is the same asymptotic ratio presented in the study of specific models in the same spirit [19, 5, 18, 9]. The main challenge here, compared to earlier results, is in dealing with the general mechanismdesign framework, that allows a large family of social-value functions for any number of players and alternatives. As opposed to the specific models, the social-value function may be asymmetric with respect to the players types; for instance, the social-value loss may a-priori occur in any entry (i.e., profile of actions). The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this general framework, we can construct mechanisms where the probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with the original social-choice function is O( 1 k ). (This fact holds for all single-crossing social-choice functions, not only for multilinear functions.) Then, we can use the multilinearity to show that the social-value loss will always be O( 1 k ) in the mechanisms we construct. Taken together, the expected loss becomes O( 1 k2 ). Our proof is constructive - we present an explicit construction for a mechanism that exhibits the desired loss in dominant strategies. The additive expected social-value depends on the length of the support of the type space. Hence, we assume that the type space is normalized to [0, 1], that is, for every player i, θi = 0 and θi = 1. Theorem 2. Assume that the type spaces are normalized to [0, 1]. For any number of players and alternatives, and for any set of distribution functions of the players types, if the social-value function g is single crossing and multilinear, then the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function (with respect to g) incurs an expected social-value loss of O( 1 k2 ). Moreover, as discussed in [4], this bound is asymptotically tight. That is, there exists a set of distribution functions for the players (the uniform distribution in particular) and there are social-value functions (e.g., auctions) for which any mechanism incurs a social-value loss of at least Ω( 1 k2 ). In that sense, auctions are the hardest problems with respect to the incurred loss. Yet, note that this claim does not imply that the loss of any social-choice function will be proportional to 1 k2 . For example, in the social choice function that chooses the same alternative for any type profile, no loss will be incurred (even with 0 actions). 67 4. OPTIMAL MECHANISMS FOR TWO PLAYERS AND TWO ALTERNATIVES In this section, we present a full characterization of the optimal mechanisms in action-bounded environments with two players and two alternatives, where the social-choice functions are multilinear and single crossing. Note that in this section, as in most parts of this paper, we characterize monotone mechanisms by their allocation scheme and by a profile of strategies for the players. Doing this, we completely describe which alternative is chosen for every profile of types of the players. It is well known that in monotone mechanisms for one dimensional environments, the allocation scheme uniquely defines the payments in the dominant-strategy implementation. We find this description, which does not explicitly mention the payments, easier for the presentation. A key notion in our characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism, is the notion of non-degenerate mechanisms. In a degenerate mechanism, there are two actions for one of the players that are identical in their allocation. Intuitively, a degenrate mechanism does not utilize all the action space it is allowed to use, and therefore it cannot be optimal. Using this propery, we then define diagonal mechanisms that turns out to exactly characterize the set of optimal mechanisms. Definition 11. A mechanism is degenerate with respect to player i if there exist two actions bi, bi for player i such that for all profiles b−i of actions of the other players, the allocation scheme is identical whether player i reports bi or bi (i.e., ∀b−i, t(bi, b−i) = t(bi, b−i)). For example, a 2-player mechanism is degenerate with respect to the rows player, if there are two rows with identical allocation in the matrix representation of the game. Definition 12. A 2-player 2-alternative mechanism with k-possible actions is called diagonal if it is monotone, and non-degenerate with respect to at least one of the players. The term diagonal originates from the matrix representation of these mechanisms, in which one of the diagonals determines the boundary between the choice of the two alternatives (see Figure 1). Simple combinatorial considerations show that diagonal mechanisms may come in very few forms. Interestingly, one of these forms is degenerate with respect to one of the players; that is, it can be described as a mechanism with k − 1 actions for this player. Proposition 2. Any diagonal 2-player mechanism has one of the following forms: 1. If both players favor the same alternative (w.l.o.g., B i A for i = 1, 2) then either (a). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1 (b). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. 2. If the two players have conflicting preferences (e.g., A 1 B and B 2 A) then either (a). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 ≥ b2 (b). t(b1, b2) = B iff b1 > b2. In both cases, the optimal mechanism can also take the form of one of the possibilities described, except one of the players is not allowed to choose the fixed allocation action. To complete the description of the optimal allocation scheme, we now move to determine the optimal strategies in diagonal mechanisms. We define the notion of mutuallymaximizer thresholds, and show that threshold strategies based on such thresholds are optimal. The reason why mutually-maximizer strategies maximize the expected social value in monotone mechanisms is intuitive: Consider some action i (row in the matrix representation) for player 1. In a monotone mechanism, the allocation in such a row will be of the form [A, A, ..., B, B] (assuming that B 2 A). That is, the alternative A will be chosen for low actions of player 2, and the alternative B will be chosen for higher actions of player 2. By determining a threshold for player 2, the social planner actually determines the minimal type of player 2 from which the alternative B will be chosen. For optimizing the expected social value, this type for player 2 should clearly be the type for which the expected social value from A equals the expected social value from B (given that player 1 plays i); for greater values of player 2, the single-crossing condition ensures that B will be preferred. Definition 13. Consider a monotone 2-player mechanism g that is non-degenerate with respect to the two players, where the players use threshold strategies based on the threshold vectors x, y. We say that the threshold xi of one player (w.l.o.g. player 1) is a maximizer if Eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, A) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) = Eθ2 ( g(xi, θ2, B) | θ2 ∈ [yj , yj+1] ) where j is the action of player 2 for which the mechanism swaps the chosen alternative exactly when player 1 plays i, i.e., t(i, j) = t(i − 1, j) (we denote, w.l.o.g., t(i, j) = A, t(i − 1, j) = B). The threshold vectors x, y are called mutually maximizers if all their thresholds are maximizers (except the first and the last). It turns out that in 2-player, 2-alternative environments, where the social-choice rule is multilinear and single crossing, the optimal expected social value is achieved in diagonal mechanisms with mutually-maximizer strategies. In the proof, we start with a k × k allocation matrix, and show that the mechanism cannot be degenerate with respect to one of the players (we show how to choose this player). If the player, w.l.o.g., the columns player, is degenerate, then there are two columns with an identical allocation. These two columns can be unified to a single action, and the mechanism can therefore be described as a k × k − 1 matrix. We then show that we can insert a new missing column, and an appropriately chosen threshold, and strictly increase the expected social value in the mechanism. Therefore, the original mechanism was not the optimal k-action mechanism. Theorem 3. In environments with two alternatives and two players, if the social-value function is multilinear and single crossing, then the optimal k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies that are mutually maximizers. A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions). However, the proof identifies the following sufficient condition under which the 68 0 1 2 3 0 A A A B 1 A A B B 2 A B B B 3 B B B B 0 1 2 3 0 A A A A 1 A A A B 2 A A B B 3 A B B B 0 1 2 3 0 B B B B 1 A B B B 2 A A B B 3 A A A B 0 1 2 3 0 A A A B 1 A A B B 2 A B B B Figure 1: The three left tables show all possible diagonal allocation scheme with 4 possible actions for each player. The rightmost table show an example for a diagonal allocation scheme where one of the player has only k − 1 possible actions. optimal mechanism will be non-degenerate with respect to both players: if the players preferences are correlated (e.g., A 1 B and A 2 B), then the optimal alternative must be the same under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). Similarly, if the players preferences are conflicting (e.g., A 1 B and B 2 A), then the optimal alternative must be the same under the profiles (θ1, θ2) and (θ1, θ2). Examples in which this condition holds are the public good model presented in section 5 and auctions [5]. We do not know how to give an exact characterization of the optimal mechanisms in multi-player and multi-alternati ve environments. The hardness stems from the fact that the necessary conditions we specified before for the optimality of the mechanisms (i.e., non-degenrate and monotone allocations) are not restrictive enough for the general model. In other words, for n > 2 players, the number of monotone and non-degenerate mechanisms becomes exponential in n. Proposition 3. The number of monotone non- degenerate k-action mechanisms in an n-player game is exponential in n, even if |A| = 2. 5. EXAMPLES Our results apply to a variety of economic, computational and networked settings. In this section, we demonstrate the applicability of our results to public-good models, signaling games and routing applications. 5.1 Application 1: Public Goods The public-good model deals with a social planner (e.g., government) that needs to decide whether to supply a public good, such as building a bridge. Let Y es and No denote the respective alternatives of building and not building the bridge. v = v1, . . . , vn is the vector of the players typesthe values they gain from using the bridge. The decision that maximizes the social welfare is to build the bridge if and only if P i vi is greater than its cost, denoted by C. If the bridge is built, the social welfare is P i vi − C, and zero otherwise; thus, g(v, Y es) = P i vi − C, and g(v, No) = 0. The utility of player i under payment pi is ui = vi − pi if the bridge is built, and 0 otherwise. It is well-known that under no restriction on the action space, it is possible to induce truthful revelation by VCG mechanisms, therefore full efficiency can be achieved. Obviously, when the action set is limited to k actions, we cannot achieve full efficiency due to the informational constraints. Yet, since g(v, Y es) and g(v, No) are multilinear and single crossing, we can directly apply Theorem 1. Hence, the information-theoretically optimal kaction mechanism is implementable in dominant strategies. Corollary 2. The k-action informationally optimal social welfare in the n-player public-good game is implementable in dominant strategies. Moreover, as Theorem 3 suggests, in the k-action 2-player public-good game, we can fully characterize the optimal mechanisms. In the proof of Theorem 3, we saw that when for both players g(θi, θi, A) = g(θi, θi, B), the mechanism is non-degenerate with respect to both players.6 This condition clearly holds here (1+ 0− C = 0+ 1− C), therefore the optimal mechanisms will use all k actions. Corollary 3. The optimal expected welfare in a 2-player k-action public-good game is achieved with one of the following mechanisms:7 1. Allocation: Build the bridge iff b1 + b2 ≥ k. Strategies: Threshold strategies based on the vectors −→x ,−→y where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, xi = C − E[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i, yk−i+1]] yi = C − E[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i, xk−i+1]] 2. Allocation: Build the bridge iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1. Strategies: Threshold strategies based on the vectors −→x ,−→y where for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1: xi = C − E[v2|v2 ∈ [yk−i−1, yk−i]] yi = C − E[v1|v1 ∈ [xk−i−1, xk−i]] Recall that we define the optimal mechanisms by their allocation scheme and by the optimal strategies for the players. It is well known, that the allocation scheme in monotone mechanisms uniquely defines the payments that ensure incentive-compatibility. In public-good games, these payments satisfy the rule that a player pays his lowest value for which the bridge is built, when the action of the other player is fixed. Therefore, the payments for the players 1 and 2 reporting the actions b1 and b2 are as follows: in mechanism 1 from Proposition 3, p1 = xb2 and p2 = yb1 ; in mechanism 2 from Proposition 3, p1 = xb2−1 and p2 = yb1−1. We now show a more specific example that assumes uniform distributions. The example shows how the optimal mechanism is determined by the cost C: for low costs, mechanism of type 1 is optimal, and for high costs the optimal mechanism is of type 2. An additional interesting feature of the optimal mechanisms in the example is that they are symmetric with respect to the players. This come as opposed to the optimal mechanisms in the auction model [5] that are asymmetric (even when the players values are drawn from identical distributions). 6 More precisely, the condition for non-degeneracy when B 1 A and B 2 A is that sign(g(θi, θi, A)−g(θi, θi, B)) = sign(g(θi, θi, A) − g(θi, θi, B)) (when sign(0) is considered both negative and positive). 7 We denote x0 = y0 = 0 and xk = yk = 1. 69 C ≤ 1 0 1 0 No p1 = p2 = 0 No p1 = p2 = 0 1 No p1 = p2 = 0 Yes p1 = p2 = 2 3 C − 1 3 C ≥ 1 0 1 0 No p1 = p2 = 0 Yes p1 = 0; p2 = 2C 3 1 Yes p1 = 2C 3 ; p2 = 0 Yes p1 = p2 = 0 Figure 2: Optimal mechanisms in a 2-player, 2-alternative, 2-action public-goods game, when the types are uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. The mechanism on the left is optimal when C ≤ 1 and the other is optimal when C ≥ 1. Example 1. Suppose that the types of both players are uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Figure 2 illustrates the optimal mechanisms for k = 2, and shows how both the allocation scheme and the payments depend on the construction cost C. Then, the welfare-maximizing mechanisms are: • If the cost of building is at least 1: Allocation: Build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k Strategies: The thresholds of both players are (for i = {1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2(k−i)·C 2k−1 − 2k−4i+1 2k−1 • If the cost of building is smaller than 1: Allocation: Build iff b1 + b2 ≥ k − 1 Strategies: The thresholds of both players are (for i = {1, . . . , k − 1}), xi = 2iC 2k−1 5.2 Application 2: Signaling We now study a signaling model in labor markets. In this model, the type of each worker, θi ∈ [θ, θ], describes the workers productivity level. The firm wants to make her hiring decisions according to a decision function f( −→ θ ). For example, the firm may want to hire the most productive worker (like the auction model), or hire a group of workers only if their sum of productivities is greater than some threshold (similar to the public-good model). However, the workers productivity is invisible to the firm; the firm only observes the workers education level e that should convey signals about her productivity level. Note that the assumption here is that acquiring education, at any level, does not affect the productivity of the worker, but only signals about the workers skills. A main component in this model, is the fact that as the worker is more productive, it is easier for him to acquire high-level education. In addition, the cost of acquiring education increases with the education level. More formally, a continuous function C(e, θ) describes the cost to a worker from acquiring each education level as a function of his productivity. The standard assumptions about the cost function are: ∂C ∂e > 0, ∂C ∂θ < 0, ∂C ∂e∂θ < 0, where the latter requirement is exactly equivalent to the single-crossing property (when C is differentiable in both variables). The utility of a worker is determined according to the education level he chooses and the wage w(e) attached to this education level, that is, ui(e, θi) = −C(θi, e) + w(e). An action for a worker in this game is the education level he chooses to acquire. In standard models, this action space is continuous, and then a fully separating equilibrium exists (under the single-crossing conditions on the cost function). That is, there exists an equilibrium in which every type is mapped into a different education level; thus, the firm can induce the exact productivity levels of the workers by this signaling mechanism. However, it is hard to imagine a world with a continuum of education levels. It is usually the case that there are only several discrete education levels (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD). With k education levels, the firm may not be able to exactly follow the decision function f. For achieving the best result in k actions, the firm may want the workers to play according to specific threshold strategies. It turns out that the standard condition, the single-crossing condition on the cost function, suffices for ensuring that these threshold strategies will be dominant for the players. We can now apply Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1 k2 ), with a dominant-strategy equilibrium. Note that while in the classic example of the job market it is not reasonable for each firm to select the education level, in other reasonable applications the social planners may be able to determine the thresholds, e.g., by fixing the levels of qualifying exams or other means for the players to demonstrate their skills. Corollary 4. Consider a multilinear decision function f, and a single-crossing cost function for the players. With k education levels, the firm can implement in dominant strategies a decision function that incurs a loss of O( 1 k2 ) compared with the decision function f. 5.3 Application 3: Routing In our last example, we show the applicability of our results to routing in lossy networks. In such systems, a sender needs to decide through which network to transmit his message. It is natural to assume that the agents (i.e., links) may not be able to report their accurate probabilities of success, but only, e.g., whether these are low, intermediate, or high. In this example, we focus on parallel-path networks. Let N1, N2 denote two networks, where each network is composed of multiple parallel paths with variable lengths from a given source to a given sink (an example for such a network appears in Figure 3). The edges in these networks are controlled by different selfish agents, and each edge appears only in one of the networks. Suppose that the sender, who wishes to send a message from the source to the sink, knows the topology of each network, but the probability of success on each link, pi, is the links private information. The problem of the sender is to decide whether to send a message through the network N1 or through an alternate network N2. Obviously, the sender wishes to send the message through N1 only if the total probability of success in N1 is greater than the success probability in N2. Let fN (−→p ) denote the probability of success in network N with a successprobability vector −→p . The social choice function in this example is thus: c(−→p ) ∈ argmax{N1,N2}{fN1 (−→p ), fN2 (−→p )}. 70 p5p4 p3 p2p1 s t Figure 3: An example for a parallel-path network, where each link has a probability pi for transmission success. We show that the overall probability of success in such networks is multilinear in pi, and thus the optimal k-action social-choice function is dominant-strategy implementable. In this example, we assume that every agent has a singlecrossing valuation function over the alternatives. That is, each player wishes that the message will be sent through his network, and his benefit is positively correlated with his secret data (e.g., the valuation of player i may be exactly pi). We would like to emphasize that the social planner in this example (the sender) does not aim to maximize the social welfare. That is, the social value is not the sum of the players types nor any weighted sum of the types (affine maximizer). The success probability of sending a message through a parallel-path network is multilinear, since it can be expressed by the following multilinear formula (where P denotes the set of all paths between the source and the sink): 1 − Y P ∈P (1 − Y j∈P pj) (3) For example, in the network presented in figure 3, the probability of success is given by f(−→p ) = 1 − (1 − p1p2) · (1 − p3) · (1 − p4p5) Thus, if all the candidate networks are parallel-path networks, the social-value function is multilinear, and we can apply Theorem 1 and get the following corollary. Note that for every link i, the partial derivative in pi of the success probability written in Equation 3 is positive. In all the other networks, that do not contain link i, the partial derivative is clearly zero. Therefore, the social-value function is single crossing and our general results can be applied. Corollary 5. For any social-choice function that maximizes the success probability over parallel-path networks, the informationally optimal k-action social-choice function is implementable (for any k).

Diseñamos un marco general para el estudio del diseño del mecanismo en entornos de un solo parámetro con espacios de acción restringidos. Nuestra contribución es triple. Primero, caracterizamos las condiciones suficientes bajo las cuales la regla de elección social teóricamente óptima se puede implementar en estrategias dominantes, y demostramos que cualquier regla multilineal de elección social es una estrategia dominante implementable sin costo adicional. En segundo lugar, identificamos las condiciones necesarias para la optimización de los mecanismos limitados por la acción y caracterizamos completamente los mecanismos y estrategias óptimas en los juegos con dos jugadores y dos alternativas. Finalmente, demostramos que para cualquier regla multilineal de elección social, el mecanismo óptimo con las acciones K incurre en una pérdida esperada de O (1 k2) en comparación con los mecanismos óptimos con espacios de acción sin restricciones. Nuestros resultados se aplican a diversos entornos económicos y computacionales, y demostramos su aplicabilidad a los juegos de señalización, modelos públicos y enrutamiento en redes.

El diseño del mecanismo de introducción es un subcampo de la teoría de juegos que estudia cómo diseñar reglas de los juegos que resulten en resultados deseables, cuando los jugadores son racionales. En un entorno estándar, los jugadores poseen información privada, sus tipos, y eligen acciones de sus espacios de acción para maximizar sus utilidades. El planificador social desea implementar una función de elección social, que asigna a cada posible estado del mundo (es decir, un perfil de los tipos de jugadores) a una sola alternativa. Por ejemplo, un gobierno que desea emprender un proyecto público (por ejemplo, construir un puente) solo si el beneficio total para los jugadores excede su costo. Gran parte de la literatura sobre el diseño del mecanismo restringe la atención a los mecanismos directos de revelación, en los que un espacio de acción de los jugadores es idéntico a su espacio tipo. Este enfoque se debe al principio de revelación que afirma que si algún mecanismo logra un cierto resultado en un equilibrio, el mismo resultado se puede lograr en uno sincero, un equilibrio donde cada agente simplemente informa su tipo privado [15]. No obstante, en muchos entornos, los mecanismos de revelación directa no son viables ya que las acciones disponibles para los jugadores tienen un poder expresivo limitado. Considere, por ejemplo, el modelo de detección bien estudiado, donde una firma de seguros desea vender diferentes tipos de pólizas a diferentes conductores en función de sus niveles de precaución, que es su información privada. En este modelo, los conductores pueden tener un continuo de posibles niveles de precaución, pero las compañías de seguros ofrecen solo unas pocas políticas diferentes, ya que podría ser inviable o ilegal anunciar y vender más de pocos tipos de políticas. Hay varias razones para restricciones tan estrictas en los espacios de acción. En algunas situaciones, las empresas no están dispuestas, o no pueden, ejecutar un proceso de licitación, pero prefieren arreglar un precio para algún producto o servicio. Los compradores en tales entornos enfrentan solo dos acciones, para comprar o no comprar, aunque pueden tener un número infinito de valores posibles para el artículo. En muchos entornos similares, los jugadores también podrían ser reacios a revelar sus tipos precisos, pero dispuestos a revelar información parcial sobre ellos. Por ejemplo, los agentes generalmente no estarán dispuestos a revelar sus tipos, incluso si es beneficioso para ellos a corto plazo, ya que podría dañarlos en futuras transacciones. Los agentes tampoco pueden confiar en el mecanismo para mantener sus valoraciones privadas [16], o ni siquiera conocer su tipo exacto, mientras que lo calcula puede ser costoso [12]. Las limitaciones en el espacio de acción también pueden ser causadas por restricciones técnicas, como restricciones severas en las líneas de comunicación [5] o de la necesidad de realizar transacciones rápidas (por ejemplo, ofertas discretas en subastas en inglés [9]).62 Considere, por ejemplo, un modelo público: un planificador social debe decidir si construir un puente. Los dos jugadores en el juego tienen algunos beneficios privados conocidos θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] de usar este puente. El planificador social tiene como objetivo construir el puente solo si la suma de estos beneficios excede el costo de construcción del puente. El planificador social no puede acceder a los datos privados de los jugadores, y solo puede aprender sobre ellos de las acciones de los jugadores. Cuando se permite la revelación directa, el planificador social puede ejecutar el conocido mecanismo de VCG, donde los jugadores tienen incentivos para informar sus datos verdaderos;Por lo tanto, el planificador puede provocar la información privada exacta de los jugadores y construir el puente solo cuando se debe construir. Suponga ahora que los jugadores no pueden enviar sus datos secretos completos, pero solo pueden elegir una acción de dos posibles acciones (por ejemplo, 0 o 1). Ahora, el planificador social claramente ya no podrá construir siempre el puente de acuerdo con su función objetivo, debido a la expresión limitada de los mensajes de los jugadores. En este trabajo tratamos de analizar lo que se puede lograr en presencia de tales restricciones. Las restricciones en el espacio de acción, para modelos específicos, se estudiaron en varios artículos anteriores. El trabajo de Blumrosen, Nisan y Segal [4, 6, 5] es el espíritu más cercano a este documento. Estudiaron subastas de un solo elemento donde los postores pueden enviar mensajes con tamaño severamente limitado. Caracterizaron los mecanismos óptimos bajo esta restricción, y mostraron que se pueden lograr resultados casi óptimos incluso con limitaciones muy estrictas en el espacio de acción. Otros trabajos estudiaron modelos similares para el análisis de subastas ascendentes de la tarde discreta [9, 11, 8, 7], subastas de toma o leve-it [17], o para medir el efecto de las clases de compradores prioritarios discretos sobreEl rendimiento de los mercados de electricidad [19, 14]. Nuestro trabajo generaliza los principales resultados de Blumrosen et al.a un marco de diseño de mecanismo general que se puede aplicar a una multitud de modelos. Mostramos que algunas propiedades principales probadas por Blumrosen et al.se conservan en marcos más generales (por ejemplo, que el equilibrio de estrategia dominante se puede lograr sin costo adicional, y que la pérdida disminuye con el número de acciones posibles a una velocidad similar), donde algunas otras propiedades no siempre se mantienen (paraEjemplo, que los mecanismos asimétricos son óptimos y que los jugadores siempre deben usar todo su espacio de acción). Una configuración de diseño de mecanismo estándar está compuesto por agentes con información privada (sus tipos) y un planificador social, que desea implementar una función de elección social, una función que asigna cualquier perfil de los tipos de agentes en una alternativa elegida. Un resultado clásico en este entorno dice que bajo cierta suposición de monotonicidad sobre las preferencias de los agentes, la suposición de cruce único (ver la definición a continuación), una función de elección social es implementable en estrategias dominantes si y solo si es monótona en los tipos de jugadores. Sin embargo, en entornos con espacios de acción restringidos, el planificador social generalmente no puede implementar todas las funciones de elección social debido a restricciones informativas inherentes. Es decir, para algunas realizaciones de los tipos de jugadores, la decisión del planificador social será incompatible con la función de elección social c.Para medir cuantitativamente qué tan bien los mecanismos de acción limitada pueden aproximar las funciones originales de elección social, seguimos una suposición estándar de que la función de elección social se deriva de una función de valor social, que asigna un valor real para cada alternativa a una alternativa ay realización de los tipos de jugadores. Por lo tanto, la función de elección social C elegirá una alternativa que maximice la función de valor social, dado el tipo de vector-→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), es decir, c (-→ θ) = argmaxa {g (-→θ, a)}. Observe que la función de valor social no es necesariamente la función de bienestar social: la función de bienestar social es un caso especial de g en el que G se define como la suma de los valoraciones de los jugadores para la alternativa elegida. Los siguientes son varios ejemplos simples de funciones de valor social: • bienes públicos. Un gobierno desea construir un puente solo si la suma de los beneficios que los agentes obtienen de él excede su costo de construcción C. Las funciones de valor social en un juego de 2 jugadores serán: G (θ1, θ2, construir) = θ1+θ2-C y G (θ1, θ2, no se construyan) = 0.• Enrutamiento en redes. Considere una red que se compone de dos enlaces en paralelo. Cada enlace tiene una probabilidad secreta de PI de transferir un mensaje con éxito. Un remitente desea enviar su mensaje a través de la red solo si la probabilidad de éxito es mayor que, por ejemplo, el 90 por ciento, la probabilidad conocida en una red alternativa. Es decir, G (P1, P2, Enviar en la red) = 1- (1-P1) · (1-P2) y G (P1, P2, Enviar en una red alternativa) = 0.9.• Subastas de elementos individuales. Considere una subasta de 2 jugadores, donde el subastador desea asignar el artículo al jugador que más lo valora. La función de elección social viene dada por: g (θ1, θ2, el jugador 1 gana) = θ1 y para la segunda alternativa es G (θ1, θ2, jugador 2 ganas) = θ2.1.1 Nuestra contribución en este documento, presentamos un marco general para el estudio del diseño del mecanismo en entornos con un número limitado de acciones. Asumimos un modelo bayesiano donde los jugadores tienen tipos privados unidimensionales, distribuidos independientemente en algún intervalo real. La pregunta principal que hacemos es: ¿Cuando los agentes solo pueden usar k diferentes acciones, qué mecanismos logran el valor social esperado óptimo? Tenga en cuenta que esta pregunta en realidad está compuesta por dos preguntas separadas. La primera pregunta es una pregunta teórica de información: ¿Cuál es el resultado óptimo que se puede lograr cuando los jugadores solo pueden revelar información utilizando estas acciones K (recuerde que su espacio de tipo puede ser continuo)? La otra pregunta implica consideraciones teóricas del juego: cuál es el mejor resultado que se puede lograr con las acciones K, donde este resultado debe lograrse en un equilibrio de estrategia dominante. Estas preguntas plantean la pregunta sobre el precio de la implementación: ¿se puede implementar siempre el resultado teórico de información óptima en un equilibrio de estrategia dominante? Y si no, ¿en qué medida el requisito de estrategia dominante degrada el resultado óptimo? Lo que llamamos el precio de la implementación también se exploró en otros contextos en la teoría de juegos donde se aplican restricciones computacionales: por ejemplo, ¿es siempre cierto que la relación de aproximación óptima en tiempo polinomial (por ejemplo, en subastas combinatorias) se puede lograr en equilibrio?(La respuesta para este interesante problema aún no está clara, ver, por ejemplo, [3, 2, 13].) Nuestra primera contribución es la caracterización de condiciones suficientes para implementar la regla óptima de elección social teórica en las estrategias dominantes. Mostramos que para la familia de funciones multilineales de valor social (que 63 es, los polinomios en los que cada variable tiene un grado de como máximo uno en cada monomio) la implementación de estrategia dominante no incurre en un costo adicional. Teorema: dada cualquier función multilineal de Valor social de un solo cruce, y para cualquier cantidad de alternativas y jugadores, la regla de elección social que es información teóricamente óptima es implementable en estrategias dominantes. Las funciones multilineales de valor social capturan muchos modelos importantes y bien estudiados, e incluyen, por ejemplo, el ejemplo de enrutamiento indicado anteriormente, y cualquier función de bienestar social en la que las valoraciones de los jugadores son lineales en sus tipos (como bienes públicos y subastas). La implementación de los mecanismos teóricamente óptimos de la información nos permite utilizar una rutina estándar en el diseño del mecanismo y primero determinar la regla óptima de SocialChoice, y luego calcular los pagos apropiados que garantizan la compatibilidad de incentivos. Para mostrar este resultado, demostramos un lema útil que da otra caracterización para las funciones de elección social cuyo precio de implementación es cero. Mostramos que para cualquier función de elección social, la compatibilidad de incentivos en los mecanismos limitados por la acción es equivalente a la propiedad de que el valor social esperado óptimo se logra con estrategias no dañadas (o estrategias umbral) .1, este lema implica queSiempre se puede implementar, con estrategias dominantes, la mejor regla de SocialChoice que se puede lograr con estrategias no dañadas. Nuestra segunda contribución es caracterizar los mecanismos óptimos limitados a la acción. Identificamos algunas condiciones necesarias para la optimización de los mecanismos en general, y utilizando estas condiciones, caracterizamos completamente los mecanismos óptimos en entornos con dos jugadores y dos alternativas. Los mecanismos óptimos resultan ser diagonales, es decir, en su representación matricial, se eligirá una alternativa en, y solo en, entradas por debajo de una de las diagonales principales (este término extiende el concepto de juegos de prioridad utilizados en [5]subastas de comunicación limitada). Completamos la caracterización de los mecanismos óptimos con la representación de las estrategias óptimas, estrategias que son mutuamente maximizadores. Dado que los pagos en una implementación de Dominantstrategy están definidos de manera única por una asignación monótona y un perfil de estrategias, esto también define los pagos en el mecanismo. Damos una prueba intuitiva de la optimización de tales estrategias, generalizando el concepto de estrategias óptimas centradas mutuamente de [4]. Sorprendentemente, a diferencia de las subastas óptimas en [4], para algunas funciones no triviales de valor social, el mecanismo diagonal óptimo puede no utilizar todas las acciones disponibles. Teorema: para cualquier función multilineal de valor social de un solo cruce sobre dos alternativas, el mecanismo de acción K de 2 jugadores informalmente óptimo es diagonal, y las estrategias dominantes óptimas son mutuamente maximizadores. Lograr una caracterización completa del mecanismo óptimo fondado de la acción para entornos múltiples o múltiples alternativos parece ser más difícil. Para respaldar esta afirmación, observamos que el número de mecanismos que satisfacen las condiciones necesarias anteriores está creciendo exponencialmente en el número de jugadores.1 La restricción a las estrategias no dañadas es muy común en la literatura. Un resultado notable de Athey [1] muestra que cuando una estrategia no decedora es una mejor respuesta para cualquier otro perfil de estrategias no frecuentes, debe existir un equilibrio puro bayesiano-nash. Nuestro próximo resultado compara el valor social esperado en los mecanismos de acción K con el valor social esperado óptimo cuando el espacio de acción no tiene restricciones. Para cualquier número de jugadores o alternativas, y para cualquier perfil de funciones de distribución independientes, construimos mecanismos que son casi óptimos, hasta una diferencia aditiva de O (1 k2). Este resultado se logra en estrategias dominantes. Teorema: para cualquier función multilineal de valor social, el mecanismo óptimo de acción K incurre en una pérdida social esperada de O (1 K2). Esta es la misma tasa asintótica probada para entornos específicos en [19, 9, 5]. Tenga en cuenta que existen funciones de elección social que se pueden implementar con K acciones sin pérdida (por ejemplo, la regla siempre elige la alternativa a). Sin embargo, sabemos que en algunos entornos (por ejemplo, subastas [5]) la pérdida óptima puede ser proporcional a 1 K2, por lo que es imposible un mejor límite superior general. Finalmente, presentamos nuestros resultados en el contexto de varias aplicaciones naturales. Primero, damos una solución explícita para un juego público con buena acción. Mostramos que el óptimo se logra en mecanismos simétricos (en contraste con las subastas limitadas por la acción [5]), y que el esquema de asignación óptimo depende del valor del costo de construcción C. Luego, estudiamos el modelo de señalización célebre, en el queLos empleados potenciales envían señales sobre sus habilidades a los empleadores potenciales mediante el nivel de educación que adquieren. Esta es una aplicación natural en nuestro contexto ya que los niveles de educación a menudo son discretos (por ejemplo, B.A, M.A y PhD). Por último, presentamos nuestros resultados en el contexto del enrutamiento en las redes, donde es razonable suponer que los enlaces informan si tienen tasas de pérdida bajas o altas, pero menos razonables para exigirles que denuncien sus tasas de pérdida precisas. El último ejemplo ilustra cómo nuestros resultados se aplican a la configuración donde el objetivo del planificador social no es la maximización del bienestar (ni variantes como maximizadores afines). El resto del documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: nuestro modelo y notaciones se describen en la Sección 2. Luego describimos nuestros resultados generales con respecto a la implementación en entornos múltiples y multi-alternativos en la Sección 3, incluido el análisis asintótico de la pérdida de valor social. En la Sección 4, caracterizamos completamente los mecanismos óptimos para los entornos de 2 jugadores con dos alternativas. En la Sección 5, concluimos con la aplicación de nuestros resultados generales a varios modelos bien estudio. Debido a la falta de espacio, faltan algunas de las pruebas y se pueden encontrar en la versión completa que se puede encontrar en las páginas web de los autores.2. Modelo y preliminares primero describimos un modelo de diseño de mecanismo estándar para jugadores con tipos unidimensionales. Luego, en la subsección 2.2, imponemos limitación en el espacio de acción. El modelo general estudia entornos con N jugadores y un conjunto A = {A1, A2, ..., AM} de M alternativas. Cada jugador tiene un tipo privado conocido θi ∈ [θi, θi] (donde θi, θi ∈ R, θi <θi), y una función de valoración dependiente de tipo VI (θi, a) para cada alternativa a ∈ A. En otras palabras, el jugador I con el tipo θi está dispuesto a pagar una cantidad de vi (θi, a) para que se elija la alternativa a. Cada tipo θi se distribuye de forma independiente de acuerdo con una distribución conocida públicamente FI, con una función de densidad siempre positiva FI. Denotamos el conjunto de todos los perfiles de tipo posibles por θ = × n i = 1 [θi, θi].64 El planificador social tiene una función de elección social C: θ → A, donde se realiza la elección de alternativas para maximizar una función de valor social G (-→ θ): θ × a → R. Es decir, C (C ((− → θ) ∈ ArgMaxa∈A {g ( - → θ, a)} asumimos que para cada alternativa a ∈ A, la función g (·, a) es continua y diferenciable en cada tipo. Dado que los tipos de jugadores son información privada, para elegir la alternativa óptima, el planificador social necesita obtener los tipos de jugadores como entrada. Los jugadores revelan información sobre sus tipos eligiendo una acción, de un conjunto de acciones B. Cada jugador usa una estrategia para determinar la acción que juega para cualquier tipo posible. Una estrategia para el jugador I es, por lo tanto, una función si: [θi, θi] - → B. Denotamos un perfil de estrategias de S = S1, ..., Sn y el conjunto de estrategias de todos los jugadores excepto I por S - I. La utilidad del jugador I del tipo θi de la alternativa A bajo el pago Pi es ui = vi (θi, a) - pi.2.1 La implementación de la estrategia dominante siguiente es una definición estándar de un mecanismo. El espacio de acción B está tradicionalmente implícito, pero lo mencionamos explícitamente ya que luego examinamos las limitaciones de B. Definición 1. Un mecanismo con un conjunto de acción B es un par (t, p) donde: • t: bn → a es la regla de asignación.2 • p: bn → rn es el esquema de pago (es decir, pi (b) es el pago aEl jugador ésimo le dio un vector de acciones b). El objetivo principal de este documento es optimizar el valor social esperado (en los mecanismos limitados por la acción) al tiempo que preserva un equilibrio de estrategia dominante. Decimos que una estrategia SI es dominante para el jugador I en el mecanismo (t, p) Si el jugador no puedo aumentar su utilidad informando una acción diferente a SI (θi), independientemente de las acciones de los otros jugadores B - I.3 Definición2. Decimos que una función de elección social H es implementable con un conjunto de acciones b si existe un mecanismo (t, p) con un equilibrio de estrategia de estrategia dominante S1, ..., sn (donde para cada i, si: [θi, θi] - → b) que siempre elige una alternativa según H, es decir, t (S1 (θ1), ..., Sn (θn)) = H ( - → θ). Un resultado fundamental en la literatura de diseño de mecanismo establece que, bajo la condición de un solo cruce, la monotonicidad de la función de elección social es una condición suficiente y necesaria para la implementación de estrategia dominante (en entornos de parámetros individuales). La condición de cruce único (también conocida como condición Spence-Mirrlees) aparece, muy a menudo implícitamente, en casi todos los documentos sobre el diseño del mecanismo en dominios unidimensionales. Sin esta suposición, se desconoce la condición general suficiente para la implementación (para una encuesta sobre este tema, ver [10]). A lo largo de este artículo, suponemos que las funciones de valoración de los jugadores son un solo cruce, como se define a continuación. La función de valoración de los jugadores será un solo cruce si el efecto de un incremento en el tipo de jugadores en la valoración de los jugadores para 2 mostraremos que, w.l.o.g., podemos centrarnos en los esquemas de asignación deterministas.3 Es decir, para cada tipo θi y cada acción bi, tenemos que vi (θi, t (si (θi), b-i)) -pi (si (θi), b-i) ¿vi (θi, t, t(bi, b - i)) pi (bi, b - i) Dos alternativas siempre son mayores para una de estas alternativas. La condición de cruce único en las preferencias de los jugadores en realidad define un orden sobre las alternativas. Por ejemplo, si el valor del jugador i para alternativo A aumenta más rápidamente que su valor para la alternativa B, podemos denotarlo por un I B. Más adelante, usaremos estos pedidos para definir la monotonicidad de las funciones de elección social. Definición 3. Una función h: θ × a → r es un cruce único con respecto a I si hay un orden débil en las alternativas, de modo que para cualquiera de las dos alternativas, tenemos eso para cada - → θ ∈ θ, ∂h ((- → θ, aj) ∂θi> ∂h ( - → θ, al) ∂θi y si aj ∼ al (es decir, al i aj y aj i al) entonces h (·, aj) ≡ h (·, al) (es decir, las funciones son idénticas). La definición de funciones monótonas de elección social también requiere un orden sobre las acciones. Este orden está implícito en la mayoría de las configuraciones estándar donde, por ejemplo, se define por el orden en los números reales (por ejemplo, en mecanismos de revelación directa donde cada tipo se extrae de un intervalo real). Cuando el espacio de acción es discreto, el orden puede determinarse por los nombres de las acciones, por ejemplo, 0, 1, ..., K-1 para mecanismos de acción K.(Por lo tanto, describimos este orden con la relación estándar en los números naturales <,>.) Definición 4. Un mecanismo determinista es monótono si cuando el jugador plantea su acción reportada y arreglando las acciones de los otros jugadores, el mecanismo nunca elige una alternativa inferior para i. Es decir, para cualquier b - i ∈ {0, ..., k - 1} n - 1 si bi> bi entonces t (bi, b - i) i t (bi, b - i). El siguiente es un resultado clásico con respecto a la implementación de las funciones de elección social en entornos de parámetros individuales. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que esta caracterización no se mantiene cuando el espacio de acción está limitado. Proposición 1. Suponga que las funciones de valoración VI (θi, a) son un cruce único y que el espacio de acción no tiene restricciones. Una función de elección social C es la estrategia dominante implementable si y solo si C es monótona.2.2 Mecanismos limitados por la acción El conjunto de acciones B generalmente está implícito en la literatura, y se supone que es isomórfica para el espacio tipo. En este artículo, estudiamos entornos donde esta suposición no se mantiene. Definimos un juego de K-Action para ser un juego en el que el número de acciones posibles para cada jugador es K, es decir, | B |= k.En los juegos de K-Action, el planificador social generalmente no siempre puede elegir una alternativa de acuerdo con la función de elección social C debido a las limitaciones informativas. En su lugar, estamos interesados en implementar una función de elección social que, con las acciones k, maximice el valor social esperado: e− → θ g-→ θ, t (s1 (θ1), ..., sn (θn)). Definición 5. Decimos que una función de elección social H: θ → A se puede lograr información informativa con un conjunto de acciones B si existe un perfil de estrategias S1, ..., Sn (donde para cada i, Si: [θi, θi]---→ b), y una regla de asignación t: bn → a, de modo que t elija la misma alternativa que h para cualquier perfil de tipo, es decir, t (s1 (θ1), ..., t (θn)) = h (−→ θ). Si | B |= K, decimos que H es K-Action Informationalmente alcanzable.65 Tenga en cuenta que esta definición no tiene en cuenta consideraciones estratégicas. Por ejemplo, considere un entorno con dos alternativas a = {a, b}, y la siguiente función de socialChoice: EC (θ1, θ2) = a IFF {θ1> 1/2 y θ2> 1/2}.La CE se puede lograr información con dos acciones: si ambos jugadores ofrecen 0 cuando su valor es mayor que 1/2 y 1 de lo contrario, entonces la regla de asignación elige alternativa A IFF Ambos reportados 1 deriva exactamente la misma asignación para cada perfil de tipos. Por el contrario, es fácil ver que la función ˆc (θ1, θ2) = a IFF θ1 + θ2> 1/2 no se puede lograr información informativa con dos acciones. Ahora definimos una regla de elección social que maximiza el valor social bajo las limitaciones teóricas de información que implican las limitaciones en el número de acciones. Definición 6. Una función de elección social es K-Action informalmente óptima con respecto a la función de valor social G, si logra el valor social esperado máximo entre todas las funciones de elección social de la acción K-acción K-acción. 4 Anteriormente en esta sección, definimosLa propiedad de un solo cruce para las valoraciones de los jugadores. Ahora definimos una propiedad individual en la función de valor social g.Esta propiedad garantiza claramente la monotonicidad de la regla de elección social correspondiente, y luego demostraremos que también es útil para entornos limitados por la acción. Definición 7. Decimos que la regla de elección social G (-→ θ, a) exhibe la propiedad de cruce único si para cada jugador I, G exhibe la propiedad de cruce único con respecto a i. Tenga en cuenta que la definición anterior requiere que G sea un cruce único con respecto a cada jugador I, dado su orden individual en las alternativas. Es decir, la función de valor social G será compatible en este sentido con las condiciones de soltería en las preferencias de los jugadores. Finalmente, llamamos la atención sobre un conjunto natural de estrategias: estrategias no dañadas, donde cada jugador informa una acción más alta a medida que aumenta su tipo. De manera equivalente, tales estrategias son estrategias umbral: estrategias en las que cada jugador divide su tipo de apoyo en intervalos, y simplemente informa el intervalo en el que se encuentra su tipo. Definición 8. Un vector real x = (x0, x1, ..., xk) es un vector de valores umbral si x0 ≤ x1 ≤ ... ≤ xk. Definición 9. Una estrategia SI es una estrategia umbral basada en un vector de valores de umbral x = (x0, x1, ..., xk), si para alguna acción j sostiene que si (θi) = j iff θi ∈ [xj, xj+1]. Una estrategia SI se llama estrategia umbral, si existe un vector X de valores umbral de tal manera que SI es una estrategia umbral basada en x.3. Implementación con un número limitado de acciones en esta sección, estudiamos el modelo general del diseño del mecanismo de acción. Nuestro primer resultado es una condición suficiente y necesaria para la implementabilidad de la solución óptima que se puede lograr con las acciones de K: esta condición dice que la regla óptima de elección social se logra cuando todos los 4 por simplicidad, suponemos que se alcanza un máximo y, por lo tanto, se alcanza un máximo y, por lo tanto.La función óptima está bien definida.Los jugadores usan estrategias que no sean dañando. La idea básica es que con estrategias no dañadas (es decir, estrategias de umbral), podemos aplicar la propiedad de un solo cruce para mostrar que cuando un jugador aumenta su acción reportada, el valor esperado para sus alternativas de alta prioridad aumenta más rápido;Por lo tanto, la monotonicidad debe mantenerse. El resultado es válido para cualquier número de jugadores y alternativas, y para cualquier perfil de funciones de distribución en los tipos de jugadores, siempre que sean estadísticamente independientes.(Es fácil ilustrar que este resultado no se mantiene si los tipos de jugadores dependen). Lema 1. Considere una función de valor social de un solo cruce g.La función de elección social K-acción social de la acción informalmente óptima (con respecto a G) es implementable si y solo si C ∗ logra su óptimo cuando los jugadores usan estrategias no dañadas. A continuación, mostramos que para una amplia familia de funciones de valor social (funciones multilineales, el precio de la implementación es cero. Es decir, la regla teóricamente óptima de la información es la estrategia dominante implementable. Esta familia de funciones captura muchos entornos comunes de la literatura. En particular, generaliza el entorno de subasta estudiado por Blumrosen et al.[4, 6]. Definición 10. Una función multilineal es un polinomio en el que el grado de cada variable en cada monomio es como máximo 1.5, decimos que una regla de elección social G es multilineal, si G (·, a) es multilineal para cada alternativa a ∈ A. La idea básica detrás de la prueba del siguiente teorema es la siguiente: para cada jugador, mostramos que el bienestar social esperado cuando elige cualquier acción (arreglar las estrategias de los otros jugadores) es una función lineal de su tipo. Este es el resultado de la multilinealidad de la función de valor social y de la linealidad de la expectativa. El máximo sobre un conjunto de funciones lineales es una función lineal por partes, por lo tanto, el valor social óptimo se logra cuando el jugador usa estrategias de umbral (los umbrales son los puntos de conmutación). Dado que el óptimo se logra con las estrategias de umbral, podemos aplicar el Lemma 1 para mostrar la monotonicidad de esta regla de SocialChoice. Tenga en cuenta que en este argumento caracterizamos las estrategias de los jugadores que maximizan el valor social, y no las utilidades de los jugadores. Teorema 1. Si la función de valor social es multilineal y un cruce único, la función de elección social K-acción social informativamente óptima es implementable. Prueba. Mostraremos que para cualquier mecanismo de acción K, el valor social esperado óptimo se logra cuando todos los jugadores usan estrategias de umbral. Esto se demostrará demostrando que para cualquier jugador I y para cualquier acción BI del jugador I, el bienestar esperado cuando elige la acción BI es una función lineal en el jugador es el tipo θi. Luego, se deducirá de Lemma 1 que la función de elección social es implementable. Para cada acción bi del jugador I, deje que QA denote la probabilidad de que la alternativa A se asigne, es decir, Qa = PR− → θ H t (s ( - → θ)) = a | si (θi) = bi i 5 Por ejemplo, por ejemplo,f (x, y, z) = xyz + 5xy + 7. 66 Debido a la linealidad de la expectativa, el valor social esperado cuando el jugador I con tipo θi informa bi es: x a∈A Qa eθ - i (g (θi, θ−i, a) | t (bi, s - i (θ - i)) = a) (1) = x a∈A qa z θ - i g (θi, θ - i, a) fa −i (θ - i) D (θ - i) (2) donde fa −i (θ - i) es igual a q j = i fj (θj) Qa para perfiles de tipos θ - i tal que t (bi, s - i (θ - i))= A, y 0 de lo contrario. Como G es multilineal, cada función G (θi, θ - I, a) es una función lineal en θi, donde los coeficientes dependen de los valores de θ - I. Denota esta función por G (θi, θ - i, a) = λθ - i θi + βθ - i. Por lo tanto, podemos escribir la ecuación 2 como: x a∈A qa z θ - i `λθ - i θi + βθ - i ´ fa −i (θ - i) d (θ - i) = x a∈A qa θi z θ−I λθ - I fa −i (θ - i) d (θ - i) + z θ - i βθ - i fa −i (θ - i) d (θ - i)! En esta expresión, cada integral es una constante independiente de θi cuando las estrategias del otro jugador son fijas. Por lo tanto, cada sumanda, por lo tanto, toda la función, es una función lineal en θi. Para lograr el valor social esperado óptimo, el jugador debe elegir la acción que maximice el valor social esperado. Un máximo de las funciones lineales K es una función lineal por partes con los puntos de ruptura en la mayoría de K-1. Estos puntos de ruptura son los umbrales a ser utilizados por el jugador. Para todos los tipos entre los umbrales posteriores, el óptimo se logra claramente por una sola acción;Dado que las funciones lineales son un solo cruce, cada acción será máxima en la mayoría de un intervalo. El mismo argumento se aplica a todos los jugadores y, por lo tanto, el valor social óptimo se obtiene con estrategias de umbral. Observe que la prueba del teorema 1 en realidad funciona para un entorno más general. Para demostrar que el resultado teóricamente óptimo de la información se logra con estrategias de umbral, es suficiente demostrar que la función de elección social exhibe una condición de cruce único sobre la expectativa: dado cualquier esquema de asignación y arreglar el comportamiento de los otros jugadores, la esperada esperadaEl valor en dos acciones (en función de θi) es un cruce único. El teorema 1 muestra que este requisito es válido para funciones multilineales, pero no pudimos dar una caracterización exacta de esta clase general de funciones. La implementabilidad de la solución teóricamente óptima de la información hace que la caracterización de los mecanismos óptimos compatibles con incentivos sea significativamente más fácil: podemos aplicar la técnica de diseño de mecanismo estándar y primero calcular el esquema de asignación óptimo y luego encontrar los pagos correctos. Observe que si las funciones de valoración de los jugadores son lineales y de un solo cruce, entonces la función de bienestar social (es decir, la suma de las valoraciones de los jugadores) es multilineal y un solo cruce. Esto se mantiene ya que las condiciones de cruce individual en las valoraciones se definen con un orden similar en las alternativas como en la función de valor social. Por lo tanto, una conclusión inmediata del Teorema 1 es que el bienestar social óptimo, que se puede lograr con las acciones de K, es implementable cuando las valoraciones son lineales. Corolario 1. Si las funciones de valoración VI (·, a) son un solo cruce y lineal en θi para cada jugador I y para cada alternativa, entonces se implementa la función de bienestar social K-acción de acción óptima informativamente.3.1 Análisis asintótico En esta sección mostramos que la pérdida de valor social de las reglas multilineales de valor social disminuye cuadráticamente con el número de acciones posibles, k.Esta es la misma relación asintótica presentada en el estudio de modelos específicos en el mismo espíritu [19, 5, 18, 9]. El principal desafío aquí, en comparación con los resultados anteriores, es tratar el marco de diseño general de mecanismo, que permite una gran familia de funciones de valor social para cualquier número de jugadores y alternativas. A diferencia de los modelos específicos, la función de valor social puede ser asimétrica con respecto a los tipos de jugadores;Por ejemplo, la pérdida de valor social puede ocurrir en cualquier entrada (es decir, perfil de acciones). La intuición básica para la prueba es que incluso para este marco general, podemos construir mecanismos donde la probabilidad de tener una asignación que sea incompatible con la función original de opción social es O (1 k).(Este hecho es válido para todas las funciones de elección social de un solo cruce, no solo para funciones multilineales). Luego, podemos usar la multilinealidad para demostrar que la pérdida de valor social siempre será O (1 K) en los mecanismos que construimos. Tomados en conjunto, la pérdida esperada se convierte en O (1 k2). Nuestra prueba es constructiva: presentamos una construcción explícita para un mecanismo que exhibe la pérdida deseada en estrategias dominantes. El valor social esperado aditivo depende de la longitud del apoyo del espacio tipo. Por lo tanto, suponemos que el espacio de tipo se normaliza a [0, 1], es decir, para cada jugador I, θi = 0 y θi = 1. Teorema 2. Suponga que los espacios de tipo se normalizan a [0, 1]. Para cualquier número de jugadores y alternativas, y para cualquier conjunto de funciones de distribución de los tipos de jugadores, si la función de valor social G es un cruce único y multilineal, entonces la función de elección social de K-Action informalmente óptima (con respecto a G)incurre en una pérdida esperada de valor social de O (1 k2). Además, como se discutió en [4], este límite es asintóticamente apretado. Es decir, existe un conjunto de funciones de distribución para los jugadores (la distribución uniforme en particular) y existen funciones de valor social (por ejemplo, subastas) para las cuales cualquier mecanismo incurre en una pérdida de valor social de al menos Ω (1 k2). En ese sentido, las subastas son los problemas más difíciles con respecto a la pérdida incurrida. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que esta afirmación no implica que la pérdida de ninguna función de elección social sea proporcional a 1 K2. Por ejemplo, en la función de elección social que elige la misma alternativa para cualquier tipo de perfil, no se incurrirá en ninguna pérdida (incluso con 0 acciones).67 4. Mecanismos óptimos para dos jugadores y dos alternativas en esta sección, presentamos una caracterización completa de los mecanismos óptimos en entornos limitados por la acción con dos jugadores y dos alternativas, donde las funciones de elección social son multilineal y un cruce único. Tenga en cuenta que en esta sección, como en la mayoría de las partes de este artículo, caracterizamos los mecanismos monótonos por su esquema de asignación y por un perfil de estrategias para los jugadores. Al hacer esto, describimos completamente qué alternativa se elige para cada perfil de los tipos de jugadores. Es bien sabido que en los mecanismos monótonos para entornos unidimensionales, el esquema de asignación define de manera única los pagos en la implementación de estrategia dominante. Encontramos esta descripción, que no menciona explícitamente los pagos, más fácil para la presentación. Una noción clave en nuestra caracterización del mecanismo óptimo de acción, es la noción de mecanismos no degenerados. En un mecanismo degenerado, hay dos acciones para uno de los jugadores que son idénticos en su asignación. Intuitivamente, un mecanismo degenerado no utiliza todo el espacio de acción que puede usar y, por lo tanto, no puede ser óptimo. Usando esta propiedad, definimos los mecanismos diagonales que resulta caracterizar exactamente el conjunto de mecanismos óptimos. Definición 11. Un mecanismo es degenerado con respecto al Jugador I Si existe dos acciones BI, BI para el jugador I tal que para todos los perfiles B - i de las acciones de los otros jugadores, el esquema de asignación es idéntico si el jugador I informa bi o bi (es decir,∀b - I, t (bi, b - i) = t (bi, b - i)). Por ejemplo, un mecanismo de 2 jugadores es degenerado con respecto al jugador de las filas, si hay dos filas con asignación idéntica en la representación matricial del juego. Definición 12. Un mecanismo alternativo de 2 jugadores con acciones K-posibles se llama diagonal si es monótono y no se defegue con respecto a al menos uno de los jugadores. El término diagonal se origina en la representación de la matriz de estos mecanismos, en el que una de las diagonales determina el límite entre la elección de las dos alternativas (ver Figura 1). Consideraciones combinatorias simples muestran que los mecanismos diagonales pueden venir en muy pocas formas. Curiosamente, una de estas formas es degenerada con respecto a uno de los jugadores;Es decir, se puede describir como un mecanismo con acciones K - 1 para este jugador. Proposición 2. Cualquier mecanismo diagonal de 2 jugadores tiene una de las siguientes formas: 1. Si ambos jugadores favorecen la misma alternativa (w.l.o.g., b i a para i = 1, 2), entonces (a).t (b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k - 1 (b).t (b1, b2) = b iff b1 + b2 ≥ k.2. Si los dos jugadores tienen preferencias contradictorias (por ejemplo, A 1 B y B 2 A), entonces (a).T (B1, B2) = B IFF B1 ≥ B2 (b).t (b1, b2) = b iff b1> b2. En ambos casos, el mecanismo óptimo también puede tomar la forma de una de las posibilidades descritas, excepto que uno de los jugadores no puede elegir la acción de asignación fija. Para completar la descripción del esquema de asignación óptima, ahora nos movemos para determinar las estrategias óptimas en los mecanismos diagonales. Definimos la noción de umbrales mutuamente maximizador y mostramos que las estrategias de umbral basadas en tales umbrales son óptimas. La razón por la cual las estrategias de maximizador mutuamente maximizan el valor social esperado en los mecanismos monótonos es intuitiva: considere alguna acción I (fila en la representación de la matriz) para el jugador 1. En un mecanismo monótono, la asignación en tal fila será de la forma [A, A, ..., B, B] (suponiendo que B 2 A). Es decir, la alternativa A se eligirá para las bajas acciones del Jugador 2, y la alternativa B se eligirá para acciones más altas del Jugador 2. Al determinar un umbral para el jugador 2, el planificador social en realidad determina el tipo mínimo de jugador 2 del que se eligirá la alternativa B. Para optimizar el valor social esperado, este tipo para el Jugador 2 debería ser claramente el tipo para el cual el valor social esperado de A es igual al valor social esperado de B (dado que el Jugador 1 juega i);Para los valores mayores del Jugador 2, la condición de cruce único asegura que B se prefiera B. Definición 13. Considere un mecanismo monótono de 2 jugadores G que no sea degenerado con respecto a los dos jugadores, donde los jugadores usan estrategias de umbral basadas en los vectores de umbral X, y. Decimos que el umbral Xi de un jugador (w.l.o.g. Jugador 1) es un maximizador si eθ2 (g (xi, θ2, a) | θ2 ∈ [yj, yj+1]) = eθ2 (g (xi, θ2, b)| θ2 ∈ [yj, yj+1]) donde j es la acción del jugador 2 para la cual el mecanismo cambia la alternativa elegida exactamente cuando el jugador 1 juega i, es decir, t (i, j) = t (i - 1, j) (denotamos, w.l.o.g., t (i, j) = a, t (i - 1, j) = b). Los vectores de umbral x, y se llaman maximizadores mutuos si todos sus umbrales son maximizadores (excepto el primero y el último). Resulta que en los entornos de 2 jugadores y 2 alternativos, donde la regla de elección social es multilineal y un cruce único, el valor social esperado óptimo se logra en mecanismos diagonales con estrategias mutuamente maximizantes. En la prueba, comenzamos con una matriz de asignación K × K, y mostramos que el mecanismo no puede ser degenerado con respecto a uno de los jugadores (mostramos cómo elegir este jugador). Si el jugador, W.L.O.G., el reproductor de columnas, es degenerado, entonces hay dos columnas con una asignación idéntica. Estas dos columnas pueden unificarse en una sola acción y, por lo tanto, el mecanismo puede describirse como una matriz K × K - 1. Luego mostramos que podemos insertar una nueva columna faltante y un umbral elegido adecuadamente, y aumentar estrictamente el valor social esperado en el mecanismo. Por lo tanto, el mecanismo original no era el mecanismo óptimo de acción K. Teorema 3. En entornos con dos alternativas y dos jugadores, si la función de valor social es multilineal y de cruce único, entonces el mecanismo óptimo de acción K es diagonal, y el óptimo se logra con estrategias umbral que son maximizadores mutuos. Un corolario de la prueba del teorema 1 es que el mecanismo óptimo de acción K-acción de 2 jugadores puede ser degenerado para uno de los jugadores (es decir, equivalente a un juego donde uno de los jugadores solo tiene K-1 acciones diferentes). Sin embargo, la prueba identifica la siguiente condición suficiente bajo la cual el 68 0 1 2 3 0 a a a a b 1 a a a a b 2 a b b b 3 b 3 b b b b b 0 1 2 3 0 a a a a 1 a a a a b 2 a a b b 3 a b b b 0 1 2 3 0 b b b b 1 a b b 2 a a b 3 a a a a b 01 2 3 0 A A A A B 1 A A B B B 2 A B B B F Figura 1: Las tres tablas izquierdas muestran todo el esquema de asignación diagonal posible con 4 acciones posibles para cada jugador. La tabla más derecha muestra un ejemplo para un esquema de asignación diagonal donde uno de los jugadores solo tiene k - 1 posibles acciones.El mecanismo óptimo no será degenerado con respecto a ambos jugadores: si las preferencias de los jugadores están correlacionadas (por ejemplo, A 1 B y A 2 B), entonces la alternativa óptima debe ser la misma bajo los perfiles (θ1, θ2) y (θ1, θ2). Del mismo modo, si las preferencias de los jugadores son conflictivas (por ejemplo, A 1 B y B 2 A), entonces la alternativa óptima debe ser la misma bajo los perfiles (θ1, θ2) y (θ1, θ2). Ejemplos en los que se mantiene esta condición son el modelo público de buena presencia presentado en la Sección 5 y las subastas [5]. No sabemos cómo dar una caracterización exacta de los mecanismos óptimos en entornos múltiples y múltiples alternativos. La dureza se deriva del hecho de que las condiciones necesarias que especificamos antes para la optimización de los mecanismos (es decir, las asignaciones no de rango y monótono) no son lo suficientemente restrictivos para el modelo general. En otras palabras, para N> 2 jugadores, el número de mecanismos monótonos y no degenerados se vuelve exponencial en n.Proposición 3. El número de mecanismos monótonos no degenerados de K-acción en un juego de N-jugador es exponencial en n, incluso si | a |= 2. 5. Ejemplos nuestros resultados se aplican a una variedad de entornos económicos, computacionales y en red. En esta sección, demostramos la aplicabilidad de nuestros resultados a los modelos públicos, juegos de señalización y aplicaciones de enrutamiento.5.1 Solicitud 1: Bienes públicos El modelo público se ocupa de un planificador social (por ejemplo, gobierno) que debe decidir si suministrar un bien público, como la construcción de un puente. Deje que sus y no denoten las respectivas alternativas de construcción y no construir el puente.V = V1 ,..., VN es el vector de los jugadores que tienen los valores que obtienen al usar el puente. La decisión que maximiza el bienestar social es construir el puente si y solo si P i vi es mayor que su costo, denotado por C.Así, g (v, y es) = p i vi - c, y g (v, no) = 0. La utilidad del jugador I bajo pago Pi es ui = vi - pi si el puente está construido, y 0 de lo contrario. Es bien sabido que bajo ninguna restricción en el espacio de acción, es posible inducir la revelación veraz mediante los mecanismos de VCG, por lo tanto, se puede lograr una eficiencia total. Obviamente, cuando el conjunto de acciones se limita a las acciones K, no podemos lograr una eficiencia total debido a las limitaciones informativas. Sin embargo, dado que G (V, Y es) y G (V, no) son multilineales y de cruce único, podemos aplicar directamente el Teorema 1. Por lo tanto, el mecanismo de kacción teóricamente óptimo de la información es implementable en estrategias dominantes. Corolario 2. El bienestar social de K-Action Informationalmente óptimo en el juego público de bienes de N-jugador es implementable en estrategias dominantes. Además, como sugiere el Teorema 3, en el juego público de bienes públicos de 2 jugadores K-Action, podemos caracterizar completamente los mecanismos óptimos. En la prueba del teorema 3, vimos que cuando para ambos jugadores g (θi, θi, a) = g (θi, θi, b), el mecanismo no es desigualizado con respecto a ambos jugadores.6 Esta condición claramente se mantiene aquí.(1+ 0− c = 0+ 1− c), por lo tanto, los mecanismos óptimos utilizarán todas las acciones K. Corolario 3. El bienestar esperado óptimo en un juego de 2 jugadores K-Action-Good-Good se logra con uno de los siguientes mecanismos: 7 1. Asignación: Construya el puente IFF B1 + B2 ≥ k.Estrategias: Estrategias de umbral basadas en los vectores-→ X,-→ Y donde por cada 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, xi = c-e [v2 | v2 ∈ [yk-i, yk-i+1] yi =C - e [v1 | v1 ∈ [xk - i, xk - i+1]] 2. Asignación: Construya el puente IFF B1 + B2 ≥ K - 1. Estrategias: Estrategias de umbral basadas en los vectores-→ X,-→ Y donde por cada 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1: xi = c-e [v2 | v2 ∈ [yk-i-1, yk-i]] yi =C - E [V1 | V1 ∈ [XK - I - 1, XK - I]] Recuerde que definimos los mecanismos óptimos por su esquema de asignación y por las estrategias óptimas para los jugadores. Es bien sabido que el esquema de asignación en los mecanismos monótonos define de manera única los pagos que garantizan la compatibilidad de incentivos. En los juegos públicos, estos pagos satisfacen la regla de que un jugador paga su valor más bajo por el cual se construye el puente, cuando se fija la acción del otro jugador. Por lo tanto, los pagos para los jugadores 1 y 2 que informan las acciones B1 y B2 son los siguientes: en el mecanismo 1 de la Proposición 3, P1 = XB2 y P2 = YB1;En el mecanismo 2 de la Proposición 3, P1 = XB2−1 y P2 = YB1−1. Ahora mostramos un ejemplo más específico que asume distribuciones uniformes. El ejemplo muestra cómo el mecanismo óptimo está determinado por el costo C: Para los bajos costos, el mecanismo de tipo 1 es óptimo, y para los altos costos, el mecanismo óptimo es del tipo 2. Una característica interesante adicional de los mecanismos óptimos en el ejemplo es que son simétricos con respecto a los jugadores. Esto viene en lugar de los mecanismos óptimos en el modelo de subastas [5] que son asimétricos (incluso cuando los valores de los jugadores se extraen de distribuciones idénticas).6 Más precisamente, la condición para la no degeneración cuando b 1 A y B 2 A es ese signo (G (θi, θi, a) −g (θi, θi, b)) = signo (g (θi, θi, a A) - G (θi, θi, b)) (cuando el signo (0) se considera negativo y positivo).7 denotamos x0 = y0 = 0 y xk = yk = 1. 69 c ≤ 1 0 1 0 no p1 = p2 = 0 no p1 = p2 = 0 1 no p1 = p2 = 0 sí p1 = p2 = 2 3 c −1 3 C ≥ 1 0 1 0 No P1 = P2 = 0 Sí P1 = 0;P2 = 2C 3 1 Sí P1 = 2C 3;P2 = 0 Sí P1 = P2 = 0 Figura 2: Mecanismos óptimos en un juego de 2 jugadores, 2 alternativos, 2-Action Public-Goods, cuando los tipos se distribuyen uniformemente en [0, 1]. El mecanismo a la izquierda es óptimo cuando C ≤ 1 y el otro es óptimo cuando C ≥ 1. Ejemplo 1. Supongamos que los tipos de ambos jugadores se distribuyen de manera uniforme en [0, 1]. La Figura 2 ilustra los mecanismos óptimos para K = 2, y muestra cómo tanto el esquema de asignación como los pagos dependen del costo de construcción C. Entonces, los mecanismos de maximización del bienestar son: • Si el costo de la construcción es al menos 1: Asignación:Construir estrategias IFF B1 + B2 ≥ K: los umbrales de ambos jugadores son (para i = {1, ..., k - 1}), xi = 2 (k - i) · c 2k - 1 - 2k - 4i + +1 2K - 1 • Si el costo de la construcción es menor que 1: Asignación: Construir IFF B1 + B2 ≥ K - 1 Estrategias: Los umbrales de ambos jugadores son (para i = {1, ..., k - 1}), xi = 2IC 2K - 1 5.2 Aplicación 2: Señalización Ahora estudiamos un modelo de señalización en los mercados laborales. En este modelo, el tipo de cada trabajador, θi ∈ [θ, θ], describe el nivel de productividad de los trabajadores. La firma quiere tomar decisiones de contratación de acuerdo con una función de decisión F ( - → θ). Por ejemplo, la empresa puede querer contratar al trabajador más productivo (como el modelo de subastas), o contratar a un grupo de trabajadores solo si su suma de productividades es mayor que algún umbral (similar al modelo público de bienvenida). Sin embargo, la productividad de los trabajadores es invisible para la empresa;La firma solo observa el nivel de educación de los trabajadores que debería transmitir señales sobre su nivel de productividad. Tenga en cuenta que la suposición aquí es que la adquisición de educación, en cualquier nivel, no afecta la productividad del trabajador, sino solo señala las habilidades de los trabajadores. Un componente principal en este modelo es el hecho de que, como el trabajador es más productivo, es más fácil para él adquirir educación de alto nivel. Además, el costo de adquirir educación aumenta con el nivel de educación. Más formalmente, una función continua C (e, θ) describe el costo para un trabajador de adquirir cada nivel educativo en función de su productividad. Los supuestos estándar sobre la función de costo son: ∂C ∂e> 0, ∂C ∂θ <0, ∂C ∂e∂θ <0, donde este último requisito es exactamente equivalente a la propiedad de cruce único (cuando C es diferenciableen ambas variables). La utilidad de un trabajador se determina de acuerdo con el nivel de educación que elige y el salario w (e) adjunto a este nivel de educación, es decir, ui (e, θi) = −c (θi, e) + w (e). Una acción para un trabajador en este juego es el nivel de educación que elige adquirir. En los modelos estándar, este espacio de acción es continuo, y luego existe un equilibrio de separación completamente (en las condiciones de cruce único en la función de costo). Es decir, existe un equilibrio en el que cada tipo se asigna a un nivel educativo diferente;Por lo tanto, la empresa puede inducir los niveles exactos de productividad de los trabajadores mediante este mecanismo de señalización. Sin embargo, es difícil imaginar un mundo con un continuo de niveles de educación. Por lo general, es el caso de que solo hay varios niveles de educación discretos (por ejemplo, BSC, MSC, PhD). Con los niveles de educación k, la empresa puede no poder seguir exactamente la función de decisión f.Para lograr el mejor resultado en acciones K, la empresa puede querer que los trabajadores jueguen de acuerdo con estrategias umbrales específicas. Resulta que la condición estándar, la condición de cruce único en la función de costo, es suficiente para garantizar que estas estrategias de umbral sean dominantes para los jugadores. Ahora podemos aplicar el Teorema 2 y mostrar que si la función de decisión F de la empresa es multilineal (es decir, las decisiones se toman para maximizar un conjunto de funciones multilineales), entonces la empresa puede diseñar el sistema educativo de tal manera que la pérdida esperadaser o (1 k2), con un equilibrio de estrategia dominante. Tenga en cuenta que, si bien en el ejemplo clásico del mercado laboral no es razonable que cada empresa seleccione el nivel de educación, en otras aplicaciones razonables, los planificadores sociales pueden determinar los umbrales, por ejemplo, arreglando los niveles de exámenes de calificación u otrossignifica que los jugadores demuestren sus habilidades. Corolario 4. Considere una función de decisión multilineal F y una función de costo de cruce único para los jugadores. Con los niveles de educación K, la empresa puede implementar en estrategias dominantes una función de decisión que incurre en una pérdida de O (1 k2) en comparación con la función de decisión f.5.3 Aplicación 3: Enrutamiento En nuestro último ejemplo, mostramos la aplicabilidad de nuestros resultados al enrutamiento en redes con pérdida. En tales sistemas, un remitente debe decidir a través de qué red transmitir su mensaje. Es natural suponer que los agentes (es decir, enlaces) pueden no informar sus probabilidades precisas de éxito, pero solo, por ejemplo, si son bajos, intermedios o altos. En este ejemplo, nos centramos en las redes de ruta paralela. Deje que N1, N2 denoten dos redes, donde cada red está compuesta de múltiples rutas paralelas con longitudes variables de una fuente dada a un sumidero dado (un ejemplo para dicha red aparece en la Figura 3). Los bordes en estas redes están controlados por diferentes agentes egoístas, y cada borde aparece solo en una de las redes. Supongamos que el remitente, que desea enviar un mensaje desde la fuente al fregadero, conoce la topología de cada red, pero la probabilidad de éxito en cada enlace, PI, es la información privada de enlace. El problema del remitente es decidir si enviar un mensaje a través de la red N1 o a través de una red alternativa N2. Obviamente, el remitente desea enviar el mensaje a N1 solo si la probabilidad total de éxito en N1 es mayor que la probabilidad de éxito en N2. Deje que Fn ( - → P) denote la probabilidad de éxito en la red N con un vector de probabilidad de éxito - → P. La función de elección social en este ejemplo es, por lo tanto, c ( - → p) ∈ ArgMax {n1, n2} {fn1 ( - → p), fn2 ( - → p)}.70 P5P4 P3 P2P1 S T Figura 3: Un ejemplo para una red de ruta paralela, donde cada enlace tiene una PI de probabilidad para el éxito de la transmisión. Mostramos que la probabilidad general de éxito en tales redes es multilineal en PI y, por lo tanto, la función óptima de opción K-Action Social-Choice es la estrategia dominante implementable. En este ejemplo, suponemos que cada agente tiene una función de valoración de soltería sobre las alternativas. Es decir, cada jugador desea que el mensaje se envíe a través de su red, y su beneficio se correlaciona positivamente con sus datos secretos (por ejemplo, la valoración del jugador que puedo ser exactamente PI). Nos gustaría enfatizar que el planificador social en este ejemplo (el remitente) no pretende maximizar el bienestar social. Es decir, el valor social no es la suma de los tipos de jugadores ni cualquier suma ponderada de los tipos (maximizador afine). La probabilidad de éxito de enviar un mensaje a través de una red de ruta paralela es multilineal, ya que puede expresarse mediante la siguiente fórmula multilineal (donde P denota el conjunto de todas las rutas entre la fuente y el fregadero): 1-y p (1− Y j∈P Pj) (3) Por ejemplo, en la red presentada en la Figura 3, la probabilidad de éxito viene dada por F ( - → P) = 1 - (1 - P1P2) · (1 - P3) · (((1-P4P5) Por lo tanto, si todas las redes candidatas son redes de ruta paralela, la función de valor social es multilineal y podemos aplicar el Teorema 1 y obtener el siguiente corolario. Tenga en cuenta que para cada enlace I, la derivada parcial en PI de la probabilidad de éxito escrita en la Ecuación 3 es positiva. En todas las otras redes, que no contienen el enlace I, la derivada parcial es claramente cero. Por lo tanto, la función de valor social es un cruce único y nuestros resultados generales se pueden aplicar. Corolario 5. Para cualquier función de elección social que maximice la probabilidad de éxito en las redes de ruta paralela, la función de elección social K-Action óptima informativamente se puede implementar (para cualquier k).

        "INTRODUCTION Mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable outcomes, when the players are rational.",
        "In a standard setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to maximize their utilities.",
        "The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative.",
        "For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.",
        "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
        "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
        "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",
        "Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.",
        "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",

        "In some situations, firms are not willing, or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for some product or service.",
        "The buyers in such environemnts face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they may have an infinite number of possible values for the item.",
        "In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial information about them.",
        "For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions.",
        "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
        "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
        "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",
        "The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits exceeds the construction cost of the bridge.",
        "The social planner cannot access the private data of the players, and can only learn about it from the players actions.",
        "When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.",
        "Assume now that the players cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1).",
        "Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages.",
        "In this work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence of such restrictions.",
        "Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were studied in several earlier papers.",
        "The work of Blumrosen, Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper.",
        "They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed to send messages with severely bounded size.",
        "They characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space.",
        "Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].",
        "Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.",
        "We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).",
        "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
        "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
        "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
        "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
        "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
        "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",
        "Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.",
        "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",
        "Consider a network that is composed of two links in parallel.",
        "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
        "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",

        "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
        "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
        "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
        "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
        "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",
        "The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
        "These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?",
        "And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?",
        "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
        "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
        "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",
        "Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.",
        "Multilinear social-value functions capture many important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare function in which the players valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions).",
        "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
        "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.",
        "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
        "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
        "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
        "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
        "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
        "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
        "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
        "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
        "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.",
        "Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.",
        "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
        "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",
        "Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.",
        "For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).",
        "This result is achieved in dominant strategies.",
        "Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).",
        "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
        "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
        "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
        "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
        "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
        "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
        "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
        "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
        "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
        "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
        "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
        "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",

        "We denote the set of all possible type profiles by Θ = ×n i=1[θi, θi]. 64 The social planner has a social-choice function c : Θ → A, where the choice of alternatives is made in order to maximize a social-value function g( −→ θ ) : Θ × A → R. That is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxA∈A{g( −→ θ , A)} We assume that for every alternative A ∈ A, the function g(·, A) is continuous and differentiable in every type.",
        "Since the players types are private information, in order to choose the optimal alternative, the social planner needs to get the players types as an input.",

This is the same asymptotic ratio presented in the study of specific models in the same spirit [19, 5, 18, 9].",

        "As opposed to the specific models, the social-value function may be asymmetric with respect to the players types; for instance, the social-value loss may a-priori occur in any entry (i.e., profile of actions).",
        "The basic intuition for the proof is that even for this general framework, we can construct mechanisms where the probability of having an allocation that is incompatible with the original social-choice function is O( 1 k ). (This fact holds for all single-crossing social-choice functions, not only for multilinear functions.)",
        "Then, we can use the multilinearity to show that the social-value loss will always be O( 1 k ) in the mechanisms we construct.",

        "Moreover, as discussed in [4], this bound is asymptotically tight.",

        "We define the notion of mutuallymaximizer thresholds, and show that threshold strategies based on such thresholds are optimal.",
        "The reason why mutually-maximizer strategies maximize the expected social value in monotone mechanisms is intuitive: Consider some action i (row in the matrix representation) for player 1.",
        "In a monotone mechanism, the allocation in such a row will be of the form [A, A, ..., B, B] (assuming that B 2 A).",
        "That is, the alternative A will be chosen for low actions of player 2, and the alternative B will be chosen for higher actions of player 2.",
        "By determining a threshold for player 2, the social planner actually determines the minimal type of player 2 from which the alternative B will be chosen.",
        "For optimizing the expected social value, this type for player 2 should clearly be the type for which the expected social value from A equals the expected social value from B (given that player 1 plays i); for greater values of player 2, the single-crossing condition ensures that B will be preferred.",

        "Consider a monotone 2-player mechanism g that is non-degenerate with respect to the two players, where the players use threshold strategies based on the threshold vectors x, y.",

        "The threshold vectors x, y are called mutually maximizers if all their thresholds are maximizers (except the first and the last).",
        "It turns out that in 2-player, 2-alternative environments, where the social-choice rule is multilinear and single crossing, the optimal expected social value is achieved in diagonal mechanisms with mutually-maximizer strategies.",
        "In the proof, we start with a k × k allocation matrix, and show that the mechanism cannot be degenerate with respect to one of the players (we show how to choose this player).",
        "If the player, w.l.o.g., the columns player, is degenerate, then there are two columns with an identical allocation.",
        "These two columns can be unified to a single action, and the mechanism can therefore be described as a k × k − 1 matrix.",
        "We then show that we can insert a new missing column, and an appropriately chosen threshold, and strictly increase the expected social value in the mechanism.",

        "In environments with two alternatives and two players, if the social-value function is multilinear and single crossing, then the optimal k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimum is achieved with threshold strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
        "A corollary from the proof of Theorem 1 is that the optimal 2-player k-action mechanism may be degenerate for one of the players (that is, equivalent to a game where one of the players has only k − 1 different actions).",

        "Note that the assumption here is that acquiring education, at any level, does not affect the productivity of the worker, but only signals about the workers skills.",
        "A main component in this model, is the fact that as the worker is more productive, it is easier for him to acquire high-level education.",

        "However, it is hard to imagine a world with a continuum of education levels.",
        "It is usually the case that there are only several discrete education levels (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD).",
        "With k education levels, the firm may not be able to exactly follow the decision function f. For achieving the best result in k actions, the firm may want the workers to play according to specific threshold strategies.",
        "It turns out that the standard condition, the single-crossing condition on the cost function, suffices for ensuring that these threshold strategies will be dominant for the players.",
        "We can now apply Theorem 2, and show that if the decision function f of the firm is multilinear (i.e., the decisions are made to maximize a set of multilinear functions), then the firm can design the education system such that the expected loss will be O( 1 k2 ), with a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
        "Note that while in the classic example of the job market it is not reasonable for each firm to select the education level, in other reasonable applications the social planners may be able to determine the thresholds, e.g., by fixing the levels of qualifying exams or other means for the players to demonstrate their skills.",

        "Suppose that the sender, who wishes to send a message from the source to the sink, knows the topology of each network, but the probability of success on each link, pi, is the links private information.",

        "We show that the overall probability of success in such networks is multilinear in pi, and thus the optimal k-action social-choice function is dominant-strategy implementable.",
        "In this example, we assume that every agent has a singlecrossing valuation function over the alternatives.",
        "That is, each player wishes that the message will be sent through his network, and his benefit is positively correlated with his secret data (e.g., the valuation of player i may be exactly pi).",
        "We would like to emphasize that the social planner in this example (the sender) does not aim to maximize the social welfare.",
        "That is, the social value is not the sum of the players types nor any weighted sum of the types (affine maximizer).",
        "The success probability of sending a message through a parallel-path network is multilinear, since it can be expressed by the following multilinear formula (where P denotes the set of all paths between the source and the sink): 1 − Y P ∈P (1 − Y j∈P pj) (3) For example, in the network presented in figure 3, the probability of success is given by f(−→p ) = 1 − (1 − p1p2) · (1 − p3) · (1 − p4p5) Thus, if all the candidate networks are parallel-path networks, the social-value function is multilinear, and we can apply Theorem 1 and get the following corollary.",

                "In a standard setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to maximize their utilities.",
                "The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative.",
                "For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.",
                "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
                "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
                "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",
                "Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.",
                "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",

                "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
                "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
                "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",
                "The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits exceeds the construction cost of the bridge.",

                "When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.",

                "Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages.",

                "They characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space.",
                "Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].",
                "Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.",
                "We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).",
                "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
                "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
                "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
                "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
                "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
                "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",

                "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",

                "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
                "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",
                "That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions.",
                "Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.",
                "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
                "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
                "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
                "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
                "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",

                "What we call the price of <br>implementation</br> was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy <br>implementation</br> incurs no additional cost.",

                "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
                "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of <br>implementation</br> is zero.",
                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
                "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
                "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy <br>implementation</br> are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
                "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
                "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.",

                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",

                "We devise a general framework for the study of mechanism design in single-parameter environments with restricted action spaces.",
                "Our contribution is threefold.",
                "First, we characterize sufficient conditions under which the information-theoretically optimal social-choice rule can be implemented in <br>dominant strategies</br>, and prove that any multilinear social-choice rule is dominant-strategy implementable with no additional cost.",
                "Second, we identify necessary conditions for the optimality of action-bounded mechanisms, and fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in games with two players and two alternatives.",
                "Finally, we prove that for any multilinear social-choice rule, the optimal mechanism with k actions incurs an expected loss of O( 1 k2 ) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted action spaces.",
                "Our results apply to various economic and computational settings, and we demonstrate their applicability to signaling games, public-good models and routing in networks.",

                "INTRODUCTION Mechanism design is a sub-field of game theory that studies how to design rules of games resulting in desirable outcomes, when the players are rational.",
                "In a standard setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to maximize their utilities.",
                "The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative.",
                "For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.",
                "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
                "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
                "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",
                "Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.",
                "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",
                "There are various reasons for such strict restrictions on the action spaces.",
                "In some situations, firms are not willing, or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for some product or service.",
                "The buyers in such environemnts face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they may have an infinite number of possible values for the item.",
                "In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial information about them.",
                "For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions.",
                "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
                "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
                "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",
                "The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits exceeds the construction cost of the bridge.",
                "The social planner cannot access the private data of the players, and can only learn about it from the players actions.",
                "When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.",
                "Assume now that the players cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1).",
                "Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages.",
                "In this work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence of such restrictions.",
                "Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were studied in several earlier papers.",
                "The work of Blumrosen, Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper.",
                "They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed to send messages with severely bounded size.",
                "They characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space.",
                "Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].",
                "Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.",
                "We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).",
                "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
                "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in <br>dominant strategies</br> if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
                "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
                "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
                "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
                "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",
                "Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.",
                "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",
                "Consider a network that is composed of two links in parallel.",
                "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
                "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",
                "That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions.",
                "Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.",
                "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
                "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
                "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
                "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
                "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",
                "The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
                "These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?",
                "And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?",
                "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in <br>dominant strategies</br>.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",
                "Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in <br>dominant strategies</br>.",
                "Multilinear social-value functions capture many important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare function in which the players valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions).",
                "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
                "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.",
                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with <br>dominant strategies</br>, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
                "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
                "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
                "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
                "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal <br>dominant strategies</br> are mutually-maximizers.",
                "Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.",
                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",
                "Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.",
                "For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This result is achieved in <br>dominant strategies</br>.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
                "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
                "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",
                "Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors web pages. 2.",
                "MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES We first describe a standard mechanism-design model for players with one-dimensional types.",
                "Then, in Subsection 2.2, we impose limitation on the action space.",
                "The general model studies environments with n players and a set A = {A1, A2, ..., Am} of m alternatives.",
                "Each player has a privately known type θi ∈ [θi, θi] (where θi, θi ∈ R, θi < θi), and a type-dependent valuation function vi(θi, A) for each alternative A ∈ A.",
                "In other words, player i with type θi is willing to pay an amount of vi(θi, A) for alternative A to be chosen.",
                "Each type θi is independently distributed according to a publicly known distribution Fi, with an always positive density function fi.",
                "We denote the set of all possible type profiles by Θ = ×n i=1[θi, θi]. 64 The social planner has a social-choice function c : Θ → A, where the choice of alternatives is made in order to maximize a social-value function g( −→ θ ) : Θ × A → R. That is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxA∈A{g( −→ θ , A)} We assume that for every alternative A ∈ A, the function g(·, A) is continuous and differentiable in every type.",
                "Since the players types are private information, in order to choose the optimal alternative, the social planner needs to get the players types as an input.",
                "The players reveal information about their types by choosing an action, from an action set B.",
                "Each player uses a strategy for determining the action he plays for any possible type.",
                "A strategy for player i is therefore a function si : [θi, θi] −→ B.",

                "A mechanism with an action set B is a pair (t, p) where: • t : Bn → A is the allocation rule.2 • p : Bn → Rn is the payment scheme (i.e., pi(b) is the payment to the ith player given a vector of actions b).",
                "The main goal of this paper is to optimize the expected social value (in action-bounded mechanisms) while preserving a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
                "We say that a strategy si is dominant for player i in mechanism (t, p) if player i cannot increase his utility by reporting a different action than si(θi), regardless of the actions of the other players b−i.3 Definition 2.",

                "A fundamental result in the mechanism-design literature states that under the single-crossing condition, the monotonicity of the social-choice function is a sufficient and necessary condition for dominant-strategy implementability (in single-parameter environments).",

                "In a standard setting, players hold some private information - their types - and choose actions from their action spaces to maximize their utilities.",
                "The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative.",
                "For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.",
                "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
                "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
                "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",
                "Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.",
                "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",

                "For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions.",
                "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
                "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
                "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",

                "When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.",

                "Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages.",

                "Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].",
                "Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.",
                "We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).",
                "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
                "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
                "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
                "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
                "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
                "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",
                "Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.",
                "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",
                "Consider a network that is composed of two links in parallel.",
                "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
                "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",
                "That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions.",
                "Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.",
                "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
                "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
                "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
                "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
                "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",
                "The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
                "These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?",
                "And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?",
                "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",
                "Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.",
                "Multilinear social-value functions capture many important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare function in which the players valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions).",
                "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
                "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.",
                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
                "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
                "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
                "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
                "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.",
                "Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.",
                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",
                "Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.",
                "For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This result is achieved in dominant strategies.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
                "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
                "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",
                "Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors web pages. 2.",
                "MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES We first describe a standard mechanism-design model for players with one-dimensional types.",

                "The social planner wishes to implement a social-choice function, which maps each possible state of the world (i.e., a profile of the players types) to a single alternative.",
                "For example, a government that wishes to undertake a public-good project (e.g., building a bridge) only if the total benefit for the players exceeds its cost.",
                "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
                "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
                "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",
                "Consider, for example, the well-studied screening model, where an insurance firm wishes to sell different types of policies to different drivers based on their caution levels, which is their private information.",
                "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",
                "There are various reasons for such strict restrictions on the action spaces.",
                "In some situations, firms are not willing, or cannot, run a bidding process but prefer fixing a price for some product or service.",
                "The buyers in such environemnts face only two actions - to buy or not to buy - although they may have an infinite number of possible values for the item.",
                "In many similar settings, players might be also reluctant to reveal their accurate types, but willing to disclose partial information about them.",
                "For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions.",
                "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
                "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
                "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",
                "The social planner aims to build the bridge only if the sum of these benfits exceeds the construction cost of the bridge.",
                "The social planner cannot access the private data of the players, and can only learn about it from the players actions.",
                "When direct revelation is allowed, the social planner can run the well-known VCG mechanism, where the players have incentives to report their true data; hence, the planner can elicit the exact private information of the players and build the bridge only when it should be built.",
                "Assume now that the players cannot send their entire secret data, but can only choose an action out of two possible actions (e.g., 0 or 1).",
                "Now, the social planner will clearly no longer be able to always build the bridge according to her objective function, due to the limited expressivness of the players messages.",
                "In this work we try to analyze what can be achieved in the presence of such restrictions.",
                "Restrictions on the action space, for specific models, were studied in several earlier papers.",
                "The work of Blumrosen, Nisan and Segal [4, 6, 5] is the closest in spirit to this paper.",
                "They studied single-item auctions where bidders are allowed to send messages with severely bounded size.",
                "They characterized the optimal mechanisms under this restriction, and showed that nearly optimal results can be achieved even with very strict limitations on the action space.",
                "Other work studied similar models for the analysis of discrete-bid ascending auctions [9, 11, 8, 7], take-it-or-leave-it auctions [17], or for measuring the effect of discrete priority classes of buyers on the performance of electricity markets [19, 14].",
                "Our work generalizes the main results of Blumrosen et al. to a general mechanism-design framework that can be applied to a multitude of models.",
                "We show that some main properties proved by Blumrosen et al. are preserved in more general frameworks (for example, that dominant-strategy equilibrium can be achieved with no additional cost, and that the loss diminishes with the number of possible actions in a similar rate), where some other properties do not always hold (for example, that asymmetric mechanisms are optimal and that players must always use all their action space).",
                "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
                "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
                "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
                "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
                "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
                "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",
                "Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.",
                "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",
                "Consider a network that is composed of two links in parallel.",
                "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
                "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",
                "That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions.",
                "Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.",
                "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
                "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
                "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
                "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
                "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",
                "The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
                "These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?",
                "And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?",
                "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",
                "Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.",
                "Multilinear social-value functions capture many important and well-studied models, and include, for instance, the routing example given above, and any social welfare function in which the players valuations are linear in their types (such as public-goods and auctions).",
                "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
                "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.",
                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
                "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
                "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
                "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
                "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.",
                "Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.",
                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",
                "Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.",
                "For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This result is achieved in dominant strategies.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
                "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
                "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",
                "Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors web pages. 2.",
                "MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES We first describe a standard mechanism-design model for players with one-dimensional types.",

                "Each player has a privately known type θi ∈ [θi, θi] (where θi, θi ∈ R, θi < θi), and a type-dependent valuation function vi(θi, A) for each alternative A ∈ A.",

That is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxA∈A{g( −→ θ , A)} We assume that for every alternative A ∈ A, the function g(·, A) is continuous and differentiable in every type.",
                "Since the players types are private information, in order to choose the optimal alternative, the social planner needs to get the players types as an input.",

In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",

                "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",

                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in <br>action-bounded mechanism</br>s is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal <br>action-bounded mechanism</br>s.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",

                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",

                "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
                "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
                "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",

                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",

                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",

                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",

                "Much of the literature on mechanism design restricts attention to direct revelation mechanisms, in which a players action space is identical to his type space.",
                "This focus is owing to the revelation principle that asserts that if some mechanism achieves a certain result in an equilibrium, the same result can be achieved in a truthful one - an equilibrium where each agent simply reports his private type [15].",
                "Nonetheless, in many environments, direct-revelation mechanisms are not viable since the actions available for the players have a limited expressive power.",

                "In this model, drivers may have a continuum of possible caution levels, but insurance companies offer only a few different policies since it might be either infeasible or illegal to advertise and sell more then few types of policies.",

                "For example, agents will typically be unwilling to reveal their types, even if it is beneficial for them in the short run, since it might harm them in future transactions.",
                "Agents may also not trust the mechanism to keep their valuations private [16], or not even know their exact type while computing it may be expensive [12].",
                "Limitations on the action space can also be caused by technical constraints, such as severe restrictions on the communication lines [5] or from the the need to perform quick transactions (e.g., discrete bidding in English auctions [9]). 62 Consider for example a public-good model: a social planner needs to decide whether to build a bridge.",
                "The two players in the game have some privately known benefits θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 1] from using this bridge.",

                "A standard mechanism design setting is composed of agents with private information (their types), and a social planner, who wishes to implement a social choice function, c - a function that maps any profile of the agents types into a chosen alternative.",
                "A classic result in this setting says that under some monotonicity assumption on the agents preferences - the single-crossing assumption (see definition below) - a social-choice function is implementable in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotone in the players types.",
                "However, in environments with restricted action spaces, the social planner cannot typically implement every social-choice function due to inherent informational constraints.",
                "That is, for some realizations of the players types, the decision of the social planner will be incompatible with the social-choice function c. In order to quantitatively measure how well bounded-action mechanisms can approximate the original social-choice functions, we follow a standard assumption that the social choice function is derived from a social-value function, g, which assigns a real value for every alternative A and realization of the players types.",
                "The social-choice function c will therefore choose an alternative that maximizes the social value function, given the type vector −→ θ = (θ1, .., θn), i.e., c( −→ θ ) = argmaxA{g( −→ θ , A)}.",
                "Observe that the social-value function is not necessarily the social welfare function - the social welfare function is a special case of g in which g is defined to be the sum of the players valuations for the chosen alternative.",
                "Following are several simple examples of social-value functions: • Public goods.",
                "A government wishes to build a bridge only if the sum of the benefits that agents gain from it exceeds its construction cost C. The social value functions in a 2-player game will therefore be: g(θ1, θ2,build)=θ1+θ2-C and g(θ1, θ2,do not build)=0. • Routing in networks.",

                "Each link has a secret probability pi of transferring a message successfully.",
                "A sender wishes to send his message through the network only if the probability of success is greater than, say, 90 percent - the known probability in an alternate network.",
                "That is, g(p1, p2, send in network)=1-(1-p1)·(1-p2) and g(p1, p2,send in alternate network)=0.9. • Single-item auctions.",
                "Consider a 2-player auction, where the auctioneer wishes to allocate the item to the player who values it the most.",
                "The social choice function is given by: g(θ1, θ2, player 1 wins) = θ1 and for the second alternative is g(θ1, θ2, player 2 wins) = θ2. 1.1 Our Contribution In this paper, we present a general framework for the study of mechanism design in environments with a limited number of actions.",
                "We assume a Bayesian model where players have one-dimensional private types, independently distributed on some real interval.",
                "The main question we ask is: when agents are only allowed to use k different actions, which mechanisms achieve the optimal expected social-value?",
                "Note that this question is actually composed of two separate questions.",
                "The first question is an information-theoretic question: what is the optimal result achievable when the players can only reveal information using these k actions (recall that their type space may be continuous).",
                "The other question involves gametheoretic considerations: what is the best result achievable with k actions, where this result should be achieved in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.",
                "These questions raise the question about the price of implementation: can the optimal information-theoretic result always be implemented in a dominant-strategy equilibrium?",
                "And if not, to what extent does the dominant-strategy requirement degrades the optimal result?",
                "What we call the price of implementation was also explored in other contexts in game theory where computational restrictions apply: for example, is it always true that the optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio (for example, in combinatorial auctions) can be achieved in equilibrium? (The answer for this interesting problem is still unclear, see, e.g., [3, 2, 13].)",
                "Our first contribution is the characterization of sufficient conditions for implementing the optimal informationtheoretic social-choice rule in dominant strategies.",
                "We show that for the family of multilinear social-value functions (that 63 is, polynomials where each variable has a degree of at most one in each monomial) the dominant-strategy implementation incurs no additional cost.",
                "Theorem: Given any multilinear single-crossing socialvalue function, and for any number of alternatives and players, the social choice rule that is information-theoretically optimal is implementable in dominant strategies.",

                "The implementability of the information-theoretically optimal mechanisms enables us to use a standard routine in Mechanism Design and first determine the optimal socialchoice rule, and then calculate the appropriate payments that ensure incentive compatibility.",
                "To show this result, we prove a useful lemma that gives another characterization for social-choice functions whose price of implementation is zero.",
                "We show that for any social-choice function, incentive compatibility in action-bounded mechanisms is equivalent to the property that the optimal expected social value is achieved with non-decreasing strategies (or threshold strategies).1 In other words, this lemma implies that one can always implement, with dominant strategies, the best socialchoice rule that is achievable with non-decreasing strategies.",
                "Our second contribution is in characterizing the optimal action-bounded mechanisms.",
                "We identify some necessary conditions for the optimality of mechanisms in general, and using these conditions, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in environments with two players and two alternatives.",
                "The optimal mechanisms turn out to be diagonal - that is, in their matrix representation, one alternative will be chosen in, and only in, entries below one of the main diagonals (this term extends the concept of Priority Games used in [5] for bounded-communication auctions).",
                "We complete the characterization of the optimal mechanisms with the depiction of the optimal strategies - strategies that are mutually maximizers.",
                "Since the payments in a dominantstrategy implementation are uniquely defined by a monotone allocation and a profile of strategies, this also defines the payments in the mechanism.",
                "We give an intuitive proof for the optimality of such strategies, generalizing the concept of optimal mutually-centered strategies from [4].",
                "Surprisingly, as opposed to the optimal auctions in [4], for some non-trivial social-value functions, the optimal diagonal mechanism may not utilize all the k available actions.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear single-crossing social-value function over two alternatives, the informationally optimal 2-player k-action mechanism is diagonal, and the optimal dominant strategies are mutually-maximizers.",
                "Achieving a full characterization of the optimal actionbounded mechanism for multi-player or multi-alternative environments seems to be harder.",
                "To support this claim, we observe that the number of mechanisms that satisfy the necessary conditions above is growing exponentially in the number of players. 1 The restriction to non-decreasing strategies is very common in the literature.",
                "One remarkable result by Athey [1] shows that when a non-decreasing strategy is a best response for any other profile of non-decreasing strategies, a pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium must exist.",
                "Our next result compares the expected social-value in k-action mechanisms to the optimal expected social value when the action space is unrestricted.",
                "For any number of players or alternatives, and for any profile of independent distribution functions, we construct mechanisms that are nearly optimal - up to an additive difference of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This result is achieved in dominant strategies.",
                "Theorem: For any multilinear social-value function, the optimal k-action mechanism incurs an expected social loss of O( 1 k2 ).",
                "This is the same asymptotic rate proved for specific environments in [19, 9, 5].",
                "Note that there are social-choice functions that can be implemented with k actions with no loss at all (for example, the rule always choose alternative A).",
                "However, we know that in some settings (e.g., auctions [5]) the optimal loss may be proportional to 1 k2 , thus a better general upper bound is impossible.",
                "Finally, we present our results in the context of several natural applications.",
                "First, we give an explicit solution for a public-good game with k-actions.",
                "We show that the optimum is achieved in symmetric mechanisms (in contrast to action-bounded auctions [5]), and that the optimal allocation scheme depends on the value of the construction cost C. Then, we study the celebrated signaling model, in which potential employees send signals about their skills to potential employers by means of the education level they acquire.",
                "This is a natural application in our context since education levels are often discrete (e.g., B.A, M.A and PhD).",
                "Lastly, we present our results in the context of routing in networks, where it is reasonable to assume that links report whether they have low or high loss rates, but less reasonable to require them to report their accurate loss rates.",
                "The latter example illustrates how our results apply to settings where the goal of the social planner is not welfare maximization (nor variants of it like affine maximizers).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: our model and notations are described in Section 2.",
                "We then describe our general results regarding implementation in multi-player and multi-alternative environments in Section 3, including the asymptotic analysis of the social-value loss.",
                "In Section 4, we fully characterize the optimal mechanisms for 2player environments with two alternative.",
                "In Section 5, we conclude with applying our general results to several wellstudied models.",
                "Due to lack of space, some of the proofs are missing and can be found in the full version that can be found on the authors web pages. 2.",
                "MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES We first describe a standard mechanism-design model for players with one-dimensional types.",

                "We denote the set of all possible type profiles by Θ = ×n i=1[θi, θi]. 64 The social planner has a social-choice function c : Θ → A, where the choice of alternatives is made in order to maximize a social-value function g( −→ θ ) : Θ × A → R. That is, c( −→ θ ) ∈ argmaxA∈A{g( −→ θ , A)} We assume that for every alternative A ∈ A, the function g(·, A) is continuous and differentiable in every type.",
                "Since the players types are private information, in order to choose the optimal alternative, the social planner needs to get the players types as an input.",
