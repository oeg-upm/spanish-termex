A mediator however can not enforce the use of its services, and each agent is free to participate in the game directly. In this paper we introduce a study of mediators for games with incomplete information, and apply it to the context of position auctions, a central topic in electronic commerce. VCG position auctions, which are currently not used in practice, possess some nice theoretical properties, such as the optimization of social surplus and having dominant strategies. These properties may not be satisfied by current position auctions and their variants. We therefore concentrate on the search for mediators that will allow to transform current position auctions into VCG position auctions. We require that accepting the mediator services, and reporting honestly to the mediator, will form an ex post equilibrium, which satisfies the following rationality condition: an agents payoff can not be negative regardless of the actions taken by the agents who did not choose the mediators services, or by the agents who report false types to the mediator. We prove the existence of such desired mediators for the next-price (Google-like) position auctions, as well as for a richer class of position auctions, including all k-price position auctions, k > 1. For k=1, the self-price position auction, we show that the existence of such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule used in the auction.

INTRODUCTION Consider an interaction in a multi-agent system, in which every player holds some private information, which is called the players type. For example, in an auction interaction the type of a player is its valuation, or, in more complex auctions, its valuation function. Every player has a set of actions, and a strategy of a player is a function that maps each of its possible types to an action. This interaction is modeled as a game with incomplete information. This game is called a Bayesian game, when a commonly known probability measure on the profiles of types is added to the system. Otherwise it is called a pre-Bayesian game. In this paper we deal only with pre-Bayesian games. The leading solution concept for pre-Bayesian games is the ex post equilibrium: A profile of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has a profitable deviation independently of the types of the other players. Consider the following simple example of a pre-Bayesian game, which possesses an ex post equilibrium. The game is denoted by H. a b a 5, 2 3, 0 b 0, 0 4, 2 A a b a 2, 2 0, 0 b 3, 3 5, 2 B At the game H there are two players. Both players can choose among two actions: a and b. The column player, player 2, has a private type, A or B (player 1 has only one possible type). A strategy of player 1 is g1,where g1 = a or g1 = b. A strategy of player 2 is a function g2 : {A, B} → {a, b}.That is, player 2 has 4 strategies. In this game the strategy profile (g1, g2) is an ex post equilibrium, where g1 = b and g2(A) = b, g2(B) = a. Unfortunately, pre-Bayesian games do not, in general, possess ex post equilibria, even if we allow mixed strategies. In order to address this problem we suggest in this paper the use of mediators. A mediator is a reliable entity that can interact with the players and perform on their behalf actions in a given game. However, a mediator can not enforce behavior. Indeed, an agent is free to participate in the game without the help of the mediator. The mediators behavior on behalf of the agents that give it the right of play is pre-specified, and is conditioned on information the agents would provide to the mediator. This notion is highly natural; in many systems there is some form of reliable party or 279 administrator that can be used as a mediator. The simplest form of a mediator discussed in the game theory literature is captured by the notion of correlated equilibrium [1]. This notion was generalized to communication equilibrium by [5, 15]. Another type of mediators is discussed in [13]. However, in all these settings the mediator can not perform actions on behalf of the agents that allow it to do so. Mediators that can obtain the right of play but can not enforce the use of their services have been already defined and discussed for games with complete information in [14].1 The topic of mediators for games with complete information has been further generalized and analyzed in [16]. In this paper we introduce another use of mediators, in establishing behaviors which are stable against unilateral deviations in games with incomplete information. Notice that we assume that the multi-agent interaction (formalized as a game) is given, and all the mediator can do is to perform actions on behalf of the agents that explicitly allow it to do so.2 In order to illustrate the power of mediators for games with incomplete information consider the following pre-Bayesian game G that does not possess an ex post equilibrium. In G, the column player has two possible types: A and B. a b a 5, 2 3, 0 b 0, 0 2, 2 A a b a 2, 2 0, 0 b 3, 0 5, 2 B A mediator for G should specify the actions it will choose on behalf of the players that give it the right to play. If player 2 wants to give the mediator the right to play it should also report a type. Consider the following mediator: If both players give the mediator the right of play, then the mediator will play on their behalf (a, a) if player 2 reports A and (b, b) if player 2 reports B. If only player 1 gives the mediator the right of play then the mediator will choose a on his behalf. If only player 2 gives the mediator the right of play, the mediator will choose action a (resp. b) on its behalf, if B (resp. A) has been reported. The mediator generates a new pre-Bayesian game,which is called the mediated game. In the mediated game player 1 has three actions: Give the mediator the right of play, denoted by m, or play directly a or b. Player 2 has four actions: m − A, m − B,a,b, where m − A (m − B) means reporting A (B) to the mediator and give it the right of play. The mediated game is described in the following figure: m − A m − B a b m 5, 2 2, 2 5, 2 3, 0 a 3, 0 5, 2 5, 2 3, 0 b 2, 2 0, 0 0, 0 2, 2 A 1 For games with complete information the main interest is in leading agents to behaviors, which are stable against deviations by coalitions. A special case of mediators was already discussed in [8]. In this paper the authors discussed mediators for a two-person game, which is known to the players but not to the mediators, and they looked for Nash equilibrium in the new game generated by the mediator. 2 This natural setting is different from the one discussed in the classical theories of implementation and mechanism design, where a designer designs a new game from scratch in order to yield some desired behavior. m − A m − B a b m 2, 2 5, 2 2, 2 0, 0 a 0, 0 2, 2 2, 2 0, 0 b 5, 2 3, 0 3, 0 5, 2 B It is now easy to verify that giving the mediator the right of play, and reporting truthfully, is an ex-post equilibrium at the mediated game. That is, (f1, f2) is an ex post equilibrium, where f1 = m, and f2(A) = m−A, f2(B) = m−B. The aim of this paper is twofold. We introduce mediators for games with incomplete information, and apply them in the context of position auctions. Our choice of positions auctions as the domain of application is not an accident; indeed, positions auctions have become a central issue in advertisement and the selection of appropriate position auctions for that task is a subject of considerable amount of study [17, 3, 9, 4].3 Current position auctions however do not possess ex-post equilibrium, i.e. solutions which are stable against unilateral deviations regardless of the agents private information, nor guarantee optimal social surplus. In contrast, in the VCG position auction, which is currently not used in practice, there is a truth-revealing ex post equilibrium, which yields optimal surplus. We therefore suggest the use of mediators in order to attempt and implement the output of the VCG position auction, by transforming other (and in particular current) position auctions into a VCG position auction.4 More specifically, the mediated game will have an ex post equilibrium, which generates the outcome of the VCG position auction. One such mediator has already been discussed for other purposes in the literature: An English auction type of algorithm was constructed in [3] that takes as an input the valuations of the players and outputs bids for the next-price position auction. It was proved there that reporting the true type to this algorithm by each player forms an ex post equilibrium, which generates the VCG outcome. In our language this algorithm can be almost considered as a mediator for the next-price position auction that implement the VCG outcome function. What is missing, is a component that punishes players who send their bids directly to the auctioneer, and a proof that using the mediator services and reporting the true type by each player is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game defined by the algorithm and by the additional component. A mediator may generate a desired outcome by punishing the players who do not use its services with very high bids by the players that use its services. We believe that such mediators are not realistic, and therefore we concentrate on the search for valid mediators that generate an ex post equilibrium and satisfy the additional rationality condition: an agents payoff can not be negative regardless of the actions taken by the agents who did not choose the mediators services, or agents who report false types to the mediator. We prove the existence of such desired mediators for the next-price (Google-like) position auctions5 , as well as for a richer class of position auctions, including all k-price position auctions, k > 1. For k=1, the self-price position auction, we show that the ex3 See also [12], where position auctions are titled ad auctions. 4 In general, except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium (see Footnote 7). 5 Our proof uses an algorithm, which is different from the algorithm in [3] discussed earlier. 280 istence of such mediator depends on the tie breaking rule used in the auction. Mediators in one-item auctions (in particular first price and second price auctions) have been already discussed in [6, 11, 2]; however they all used a Bayesian model. Position auctions are a restricted type of general pre-Bayesian games. In this conference version we make the formal definition of mediators and implementing by mediation for the special case of position auctions, and only in the full version we present the general theory of mediators for pre-Bayesian games. Most of the proofs are omitted from this conference version. 2. POSITION AUCTIONS In a position auction there is a seller who sells a finite number of positions j ∈ K = {1, ..., m}. There is a finite number of (potential) bidders i ∈ N = {1, ..., n}. We assume that there are more bidders than positions, i.e. n > m. The positions are sold for a fixed period of time. For each position j there is a commonly-known number αj > 0, which is interpreted as the expected number of visitors at that position. αj is called the click-through rate of position j. We assume that α1 > α2 > αm > 0. If i holds a position then every visitor to this position gives i a revenue of vi > 0, where vi is called the valuation of i. The set of possible valuations of i is Vi = (0, ∞). We assume that the players utility functions are quasilinear. That is, if player i is assigned to position j and pays pi per click then his utility is αj(vi − pi). Every player is required to submit a bid, bi ∈ Bi = [0, ∞). We assume that bidding 0 is a symbol for non-participation. Therefore, a player with a bid 0 is not assigned to any position, and it pays 0. In all position auctions we consider, the player with the highest positive bid receives the first position, the player with the second highest positive bid receives the second position, and so on. It is useful to define for every position auction two dummy positions m + 1 and −1, which more than one player may be assigned to. All players, who participate in the auction but do not get a position in K are assigned to position m + 1 and all players who choose not to participate are assigned to position −1. We also define αm+1 = α−1 = 0. An assignment of players to positions is called an allocation. Hence, an allocation is a vector s = (s1, s2, · · · , sn) with si ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} such that if si ∈ K then si = sl for every l = i; si is the position of player i. Given the above, a position auction is defined by its tie breaking rule, which determines the allocation in case of ties, and by its payment scheme. These are discussed below. 2.1 Tie breaking rules In practice, the most commonly used tie breaking rule is the First-Arrival rule: if a set of players submit the same bid, their priority in receiving the positions is determined by the times their bids were recorded; An earlier bid receives a higher priority. In auction theory this tie breaking rule is typically modelled by assuming that the auctioneer is using a random priority rule. More specifically, let Γ be the set of all permutations, γ = (γ1, ..., γn) of N. Every such γ defines a priority rule as follows: i has a higher priority than k if and only if γi < γk. Every vector of bids b and a permutation γ uniquely determine an allocation. An auctioneer who is using the random priority rule chooses a fixed priority rule γ by randomizing uniformly over Γ. However, the resulting priority rule is not told to the players before they make their bids. When the priority rule γ is told to the players before they make their bids, the tie breaking rule is called a fixed priority rule. Dealing with a fixed priority rule simplifies notations and proofs, and in most cases, and in particular in this paper, results that are obtained with this tie breaking rule are identical to the results obtained with the random priority rule. Therefore we will assume this tie breaking rule. In contrast, in Section 7 we discuss a non-standard approach for analyzing directly the first-arrival tie breaking rule. Unless we say specifically otherwise we assume in this paper a fixed priority rule. Without loss of generality we assume that the fixed priority rule is defined by the natural order, ˜γ = (1, 2, ..., n). That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the following definitions, which apply to all position auctions: We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to when the bid profile is b. The allocation determined by b is denoted by s(b) = (s(b, 1), s(b, 2), · · · , s(b, n)). For every j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} we denote by δ(b, j) the set of players assigned to position j. Note that for j ∈ K, δ(b, j) contains at most one player. 2.2 The payment schemes Let α be a click-trough rate vector. Each position j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} is associated with a payment function, pα j : B → R+, where pα j (b) is the payment for position j when the bid profile is b. Naturally we assume that pα −1 is identically zero. However, we also assume that pα m+1 is identically zero. Hence, a participant who is not assigned a real position pays nothing. We call the vector of payment functions pα = (pα j )j∈K the position payment scheme. Remark: Whenever α is fixed or its value is clear from the context we will allow ourselves to omit the superscript α from the payment and other functions. We deal with anonymous position payment schemes, i.e. the players payments to the auctioneer are not influenced by their identities. This is modeled as follows: Let b ∈ B = B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn be a bid profile. We denote by b(j) the jth highest bid in b. For j > n we let b(j) = 0. For example if b = (3, 7, 3, 0, 2) then b(1) = 7, b(2) = 3, b(3) = 3, b(4) = 2, b(5) = 0. We denote b∗ = (b(1), · · · , b(n)). Anonymity is modeled by the requirement that for every two bid profiles b, d ∈ B, p(b) = p(d) whenever b∗ = d∗ . That is, for every position j there exists a real-valued function ˜pj defined over all ordered vectors of bids such that for every b ∈ B pj(b) = ˜pj(b∗ ). We further assume that a player never pays more than his bid. That is pj(b) ≤ b(j) for every b ∈ B and for every j ∈ K. It is convenient in certain cases to describe the payment functions indexed by the players. Let G be a position auction with a position payment scheme p. For every player i we denote qi(b) = ps(b,i)(b), 281 and q(b) = (q1(b), q2(b), · · · qn(b)). Note that the correspondence p → q is one-to-one. We call q the player payment scheme. All our assumptions about the position payment schemes can be transformed to analogous assumptions about the player payment schemes. For convenience, a position auction will be described either by its position payment scheme or by its player payment scheme. The utility function for player i, wi : Vi × B → R+ is defined as follows: wi(vi, b) = αs(b,i)(vi − qi(b)) = αs(b,i)(vi − ps(b,i)(b)). 2.3 Central position auctions We next describe the payment schemes of three central position auctions. Self-price position auctions: Each player who is assigned to a position with a positive click-through rate pays his own bid. That is, for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(j) (1) Next-price position auctions: In this auction (run with a slight variation by Google), every player who is assigned to a position with a positive click-through rate pays the bid of the player assigned to the position right after him if there is such a player, and zero otherwise. That is for every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(j+1) (2) VCG position auctions: In a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) position auction the payment function for position j ∈ K is defined as follows.6 For every b ∈ B pvcg j (b) = Pm+1 k=j+1 b(k)(αk−1 − αk) αj (3) Note that the VCG position auction is not the next-price position auction unless there is only one position and α1 = 1. 2.4 Mediators for position auctions We denote by G = G(α, p) the position auction with the click-through rate vector α and the payment scheme p. Recall that the set of types of i is Vi = (0, ∞). Let V = V1 × V2 × · · · × Vn be the set of profile of types, and for every S ⊆ N let VS = ×i∈SVi. A mediator for G is a vector of functions m = (mS)S⊆N , where mS : VS → BS. The mediator m generates a preBayesian game Gm, which is called the mediated game. In this game every player i receives his type vi and can either send a type, ˆvi (not necessarily the true type) to the mediator, or send a bid directly to the auction. If S is the set of players that send a type to the mediator, the mediator bids on their behalf mS(ˆvS). Hence, the action set of player i in the mediated game is Bi ∪Vi, where conveniently Vi denotes both, (0, ∞) , and a copy of (0, ∞), which is disjoint from 6 We use the standard payment function of the VCG mechanism. A general VCG mechanism may be obtained from the standard one by adding an additional payment function to each player, which depends only on the types of the other players. Some authors (see e.g., [7]) call the standard VCG mechanism, the VC mechanism. According to this terminology we actually deal with VC position auctions. However, we decided to use the more common terminology. Bi. We introduce the following terminology: The T-strategy for a player in the mediated game is the strategy, in which this player uses the mediators services and reports his true value to the mediator. The T-strategy profile is the profile of strategies in which every player is using the T-strategy. The T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: E1: i is not better off when he gives the mediator the right of play and report a false type. That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i)). E2: i is not better off when he bids directly. That is for every bi ∈ Bi, wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i)) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\\i(v−i))). Whenever the T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, the mediator m implements an outcome function in G. This outcome function is denoted by ϕm , and it is defined as follows: ϕm (v) = (s(mN (v)), q(mN (v)). Hence, the range of the function ϕm is the Cartesian product of the set of allocations with Rn +. 3. IMPLEMENTING THE VCG OUTCOME FUNCTION BY MEDIATION In general, except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium.7 Therefore, the behavior of the participants in most position auctions cannot be analytically predicted, and in practice it can form a non-efficient allocation: an allocation that does not maximize social surplus. In contrast, in the VCG position auction the truth-reporting strategy is a dominant strategy for every player, and the resulting allocation is efficient. Given a position auction G our goal is to construct a mediator that would implement the outcome function of the VCG position auction. This outcome function is defined as follows: ϕvcg (v) = (s(v), qvcg (v)). Definition: Let G be a position auction . Let m be a mediator for G. We say the m implements the VCG outcome function in G, or that it implements ϕvcg in G if the Tstrategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, and ϕm = ϕvcg . We demonstrate our definitions so far by a simple example: Example 1. Consider a self-price auction G = G(α, p) with 2 players and one position, with α1 = 1. That is, G is a standard two-person first-price auction. The corresponding VCG position auction is a standard second-price auction. We define a family of mediators mc , c ≥ 1, each of them implements the VCG position auction. Assume both 7 Actually, it can be shown that if a strategy profile b in a position auction is an ex post equilibrium then for every player i bi is a dominant strategy. It is commonly conjectured that except for some extremely artificial combinatorial auctions , the VCG combinatorial auctions are the only ones with dominant strategies (see [10]). 282 players use the mediators services and send him the types ˆv = (ˆv1, ˆv2), then all mediators act similarly and as follows: If ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 the mediator makes the following bids on behalf of the players: b1 = ˆv2, and b2 = 0. If ˆv2 > ˆv1, the mediator makes the bids b1 = 0, b2 = ˆv1. If only one player uses the mediator services, say player i, then mediator mc bids bi = cˆvi on behalf of i. We claim that for every c > 1, the T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game generated by mc . Indeed, assume player 2 reports his type v2 to the mediator, and consider player 1. If v1 ≥ v2 then by using the T-strategy player 1 receives the position and pays v2. Hence, 1s utility is v1 −v2. If player 1 deviates by using the mediators services and reporting ˆv1 ≥ v2 his utility is still v1 − v2. If he reports ˆv1 < v2 his utility will be 0. If player 1 does not use the mediator, he should bid at least cv2 in order to get the positions, and therefore his utility cannot exceed v1 − v2. If v1 < v2, then the T-strategy yields 0 to player 1, and any other strategy yields a non-positive utility. Obviously each of the mediators mc implements the VCG outcome function. Note however, that the T-strategy is not a dominant strategy when c > 1; e.g. if v1 > v2 and player 2 bids directly v2 (without using the mediator services), then bidding directly v1 is better for player 1 than using the Tstrategy: in the former case player 1s utility is 0 and in the latter case her utility is negative. It is interesting to note that this simple example can not be extended to general self-price position auctions, as will be discussed in section 4. While each of the mediators mc in Example 1 implements the VCG outcome function, the mediator with c = 1 has a distinct characteristic: a player who uses the T-strategy cannot get a negative utility. In contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1. This motivates our definition of valid mediators: Let G be a position auction. A mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a nonnegative level of utility. Formally, a mediator m for G, is valid if for every subset S ⊆ N and every player i ∈ S wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S) ≥ 0 for every b−S ∈ B−S and every vs ∈ VS. 4. MEDIATORS IN NEXT-PRICE POSITION AUCTIONS We now show that there exists a valid mediator, which implements the VCG outcome function in next-price position auctions. Although in the following section we prove a more general result, we present this result first, given the importance of next-price position auctions in the literature and in practice. Our proof makes use of the following technical lemma. Lemma 1. Let pvcg be the VCG payment scheme. 1. pvcg j (b) ≤ b(j+1) for every j ∈ K. 2. pvcg j (b) ≥ pvcg j+1(b) for every j = 1, ..., m − 1 and for every b ∈ B, where for every j, equality holds if and only if b(j+1) = b(j+2) = · · · = b(m+1). The proof of Lemma 1 is given in the full version. We can now show: Theorem 2. Let G be a next-price position auction. There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G. Theorem 2 follows from a more general theorem given in the next section. However, we still provide a proof since a more simple and intuitive mediator is constructed for this case. Proof of Theorem 2. We define a mediator m, which will implement the VCG outcome function in G: For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is defined as follows: For every player i such that 2 ≤ s(v, i) ≤ m let bi(v) = pvcg s(v,i)−1(v).8 For every i ∈ δ(v, m + 1), bi(v) = pvcg m (v). Let bδ(v,1)(v) = 1 + max{i:s(v,i)≥2}bi(v). For every S ⊆ N such that S = N and for every vS ∈ VS let mS(v) = vS. This completes the description of the mediator m. We show that ϕm (v) = ϕvcg (v) for every v ∈ V . Let v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector. We have to show that s(b(v)) = s(v) and that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v): We begin by showing that s(b(v)) = s(v). It is sufficient to show that whenever 1 ≤ s(v, i) < s(v, l) ≤ m + 1 for some i = l, then s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l). We first show it for s(v, i) = 1, that is δ(v, 1) = i. In this case bδ(v,1)(v) > bj(v) for every j = i, s(b(v), i) = 1. Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l). If s(v, i) > 1, we distinguish between two cases. 1. vi = vl. Since s(v, i) < s(v, l), the fixed priority rule implies that i < l. By the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v). Therefore bi(v) ≥ bl(v), which yields s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l). 2. vi > vl. Let j + 1 = s(v, i). That is v(j+1) = vi, and therefore by the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,i)(v). Since s(v, i) ≤ s(v, l) − 1, by the second part of Lemma 1, pvcg s(v,i)(v) ≥ pvcg s(v,l)−1(v). Therefore pvcg s(v,i)−1(v) > pvcg s(v,l)−1(v), which yields bi(v) > bl(v). Therefore s(b(v), i) < s(b(v), l). This completes the proof that s(b(v)) = s(v) for all v ∈ V . Observe that for every player i such that s(b(v), i) ∈ K ps(b(v),i)(b(v)) = pvcg s(v,i)(v). Therefore qi(b(v)) = qvcg i (v) for every i ∈ N. This shows that q(b(v)) = qvcg (v) for all v ∈ V . Hence, ϕm = ϕvcg . We proceed to prove that the T-strategy is an ex-post equilibrium. Note that by the truthfulness of VCG, it is not beneficial for any player i to miss report her value to the mediator, given that all other players use the T-strategy. Next we show that it is not beneficial for a single player i ∈ N to participate in the auction directly if all other players use the T-strategy. Fix some v ∈ V . Assume that player i is the only player that participates directly in the auction. Hence, v−i is the vector of bids submitted by the mediator. Let bi be player is bid. Let k = s(v, i). Therefore, since ϕm = ϕvcg , s(b(v), i) = k. Let j be player is position in the deviation. Hence j = s((v−i, bi), i). If j /∈ K then player is 8 Recall that s(b, i) denotes the position of player i under the bid profile b, and δ(b, j) denotes the set of players assigned to position j. Whenever j ∈ K, we slightly abuse notations, and also refer to δ(b, j) as the player that is assigned to position j. 283 utility is zero and therefore deviating is not worthwhile for i. Suppose j ∈ K. Then αk(vi − pk(b(v))) = αk(vi − pvcg k (v)) ≥ αj(vi − pvcg j (v−i, bi)) ≥ αj(vi − v(j+1)), where the first equality follows from ϕm = ϕvcg , the first inequality follows since VCG is truthful, and the second inequality follows from the first part of Lemma 1. Since pj is position js payment function in the next-price position auction, αj(vi − v(j+1)) = αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)). Therefore αk(vi − pk(b(v))) ≥ αj(vi − pj(v−i, bi)). Hence, player i does not gain from participating directly in the auction. Finally we show that m is valid. If all players choose the mediator then by the first part of Lemma 1 each player which uses the T-strategy will not pay more than his value. Consider the situation in which a subset of players, S, participate directly in the auction. Since the mediator submits the reported values on behalf of the other players, these other players will not pay more than their reported values. Hence a player which used the T-strategy will not pay more than his value. 2 5. MEDIATORS IN GENERALIZED NEXTPRICE POSITION AUCTIONS In the previous section we discussed the implementation of the VCG outcome function in the next price position auction. In this section we deal with a more general family of position auctions, in which the payment of each player who has been assigned a position, is a function of the bids of players assigned to lower positions than his own. The payment scheme p of such a position auction satisfies the following condition: N1: For every j ∈ K and every b1 , b2 ∈ B such that b1 (l) = b2 (l) for every l > j, we have that pj(b1 ) = pj(b2 ). We next provide sufficient conditions for implementing the VCG outcome function by a valid mediator in position auctions whose payment schemes satisfy N1. We need the following notation and definition. For every position auction G and every b ∈ B let ϕG (b) = (s(b), q(b)). We say that G is a V CG cover if for every v ∈ V there exists b ∈ B such that ϕG (b) = ϕvcg (v). We say that G is monotone if pj(b) ≥ pj(b ) for every j ∈ K and for every b ≥ b , where b ≥ b if and only if bi ≥ bi for every i ∈ N. We are now able to show: Theorem 3. Let G = G(α, p) be a position auction such that p satisfies N1. If the following conditions hold then there exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G: 1. G is a V CG cover 2. G is monotone. The proof of Theorem 3 is given in the full version. We next provide the construction of the valid mediator, which will implement the VCG outcome function in a position auction G, which satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3: Algorithm for building m for G: • For every v ∈ V let mN (v) = b(v), where b(v) is some bid profile such that ϕG (b(v)) = ϕvcg (v) • For every i and for every v−i ∈ V−i, let vi = (v−i, M(v−i)), where M(v−i) = 1 + maxj=ivj. • For every i ∈ N and every v−i ∈ V−i, let mN\\{i}(v−i) = b−i(vi ), where b(vi ) is some bid profile such that ϕG (b(vi )) = ϕvcg (vi ). • For every S ⊆ N, such that 1 ≤ |S| ≤ n − 2, let mS(vS) = vS. Remark: As we wrote, Theorem 3 applies in particular to next-price position auctions discussed in Section 4. However, this Theorem applies to many other interesting position auctions as will be shown later. Moreover, the mediator constructed for this general case is different from the one in the proof of Theorem 2. We now show that condition N1 as well as the requirement that G is a V CG cover, and the requirement that G is monotone are all necessary for establishing our result. It is easy to see that if G is not a V CG cover then Theorem 3 does not hold. The following example shows the necessity of the monotonicity condition. Example 4. Let G = G(α, p) be the following position auction. Let n = 4, m = 3, α = (100, 10, 1), p1(b) = b(2) − b(3) and p2(b) = b(3)+b(4) 2 , and p3(b) = b(4). Notice that G is not monotone. Observe that condition N1 is satisfied. In the full version we show that G is a V CG cover, and it is not possible to implement the VCG outcome function in G with a valid mediator. The next example shows that Theorem 3 does not hold, when condition N1 is not satisfied. Example 5. Let G = G(α, p) be the following position auction. Let N = {1, 2, 3}, K = {1, 2} and α = (2, 1). Let p1(b) = b(1) 4 and p2(b) = b(2). It is immediate to see that the monotonicity condition is satisfied. We next show that G is a V CG cover. Let v ∈ V be an arbitrary valuation vector. We need to find a bid profile b(v) such that ϕG (b(v)) = ϕvcg (v). Note that pvcg 1 (v) = v(2)+v(3) 2 and pvcg 2 (v) = v(3). We define the bid profile b(v) as follows. Let bδ(v,3)(v) = v(3) 2 , bδ(v,2)(v) = v(3) and bδ(v,1)(v) = 2v2 + 2v(3). By the construction of b(v), s(b(v), i) = s(v, i) for i = 1, 2, 3 . In addition observe that pj(b(v)) = pvcg j (v) for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore ϕG (b(v)) = ϕvcg(v). Since v is arbitrary, G is a V CG cover. Naturally N1 is not satisfied. Suppose in negation that there exists a valid mediator m, which implements the VCG outcome function in G. Consider the following vector of valuations v = (12, 10, 8). If all players use the mediator then player 2 (with valuation 10) gets position 2, pays 8, and therefore her utility is 1(10−8) = 2. Player 2 can always bid more than the other players, and by that cause some other player to be positioned second; Since the mediator is required to be valid it must be that the mediator submits not more than 12 on behalf of both players 1 and 3. But then player 2 can bid 13, and win the first position; therefore, player 2s utility will be 2(10 − 13 4 ) > 8. This contradicts that m is a valid mediator that implements the VCG outcome function in G. To summarize, we have shown sufficient conditions for transforming a large class of position auctions to the V CG 284 position auction by mediation. Moreover by dropping any of our conditions we get that such transformation might not be feasible. In the next subsections we provide classes of interesting position auctions which can be transformed to the VCG position auction by mediation. These auctions satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3. However, in order to use Theorem 3 one has to check that a certain position auction, G is a VCG cover. In the full version paper, before we apply this theorem we present another useful theorem that gives sufficient conditions guaranteeing that G is a VCG cover. 5.1 Generalized next-price position auctions In a generalized next-price auction the payment scheme is of the following form. For every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(l(j)) where l(j) is an integer such that l(j) > j.9 . We show: Proposition 1. Let G be a generalized next-price position auction. There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G if and only if the following two conditions hold: (i) l(j + 1) > l(j) for j = 1, ..., m − 1, and (ii) l(m) ≤ n. 5.2 K-next-price position auctions In k-next-price position auctions the payment scheme is defined as follows: For every j ∈ K and for every b pj(b) = b(j+k). K-next-price position auctions are, in particular generalized next-price position auctions. Therefore Proposition 1 yields as a corollary: Proposition 2. Let k ≥ 1. Let G be a k-next-price position auction. There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G if and only if n ≥ m + k − 1. 5.3 Weighted next-price position auctions In weighted next-price position auctions the payment schemes are of the following form. For every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B, pj(b) = b(j+1) cj , where cj ≥ 1. Proposition 3. Let G be a weighted next-price position auction with the weights c1, c2, ..., cm. There exists a valid mediator that implements ϕvcg in G if and only if c1 ≥ · · · ≥ cm. 5.4 Google-like position auctions Google-like ad auctions are slightly different from nextprice auction. In these auctions the click-trough rate of an ad i in position j is the product of the quality of ad i, βi > 0, and the position click-trough rate αj > 0.10 Players are ranked in the positions by biβi. Let b ∈ B. Let ˜δ(b, j) be defined as follows. For every j ∈ K, let ˜δ(b, j) be the player i that obtains position j, and for j = m let ˜δ(b, j) = i, where i obtained position m in case there is more than one player i such that bi = b(m), then i is chosen between them via the breaking rule ˜γ. If player i obtains position j ∈ K then she pays pj(b) = β˜δ(b,j+1) b˜δ(b,j+1) βi . Therefore player is utility will be αjβi(vi − b˜δ(b,j+1) βi β˜δ(b,j+1)) = αj(viβi − b˜δ(b,j+1)β˜δ(b,j+1)). 9 Recall that b(j) = 0 for every j > n 10 See e.g. [17]. Hence by denoting ˜vi = viβi for every i ∈ N, and by applying Theorem 2 we obtain: Proposition 4. There exists a valid mediator which implements the VCG outcome function in the Google-like position auction. 6. SELF-PRICE POSITION AUCTIONS Let G be a self-price position auction as described at section 2. At example 1 we showed that when there is one position and two players, the VCG outcome function is implemented by a valid mediator in this auction. The proof in this example can be easily generalized to show that the VCG outcome function can be implemented by a valid mediator in a self-price position auction, in which there is one position and an arbitrary number of players, n ≥ 2. Next we show that it is impossible to implement the VCG outcome function, even by a non-valid mediator, in a selfprice position auction which has more than one position (m > 1). Theorem 6. Let G be a self-price position auction with more than one position. There is no mediator that implements the VCG outcome function in G. Proof. Let v ∈ V be the following valuation profile. vn = 10 and v1 = v2 = · · · = vn−1 = 5. The VCG outcome function assigns to this v an allocation, in which player n receives position 1 and player 1 receives position 2. The payments of players n and 1 are both equal to 5. In order to implement such an outcome, a mediator must bid 5 on behalf of player n (so that this player pays 5), and it must bid less than 5 on behalf of any other player, because otherwise another player receives position 1. Note that the bid of any other player cannot equal 5 because every other player has an higher priority than n. In particular, even if player 1 gets indeed position 2 he will pay less than 5. Hence, no mediator can implement the VCG outcome function in G.2 The proof of Theorem 6 heavily uses the fixed priority rule assumption. However, as we have already said, all our results including this theorem hold also for the tie breaking rule defined by the random priority rule. The proof of the impossibility theorem for the random priority rule uses the fact that the particular bad priority rule used in the proof of Theorem 6, has a positive probability. As we previously discussed, the fixed and random priority rules are just convenient ways to model the first-arrival rule, which is common in practice. When one attempts to directly model position auctions that use the first-arrival rule without these modeling choices he tackles a lot of modeling problems. In particular, it is not clear how to model a position auction with the first-arrival rule as a game with incomplete information. To do this, one has to allow a player not only to submit a bid but also to decide about the time of the bid. This raises a lot of additional modeling problems, such as determining the relationship between the time a player decides to submit a bid and the time in which this bid is actually recorded. Hence, efficient modeling as a game may be untractable. Nevertheless, in the next section we will analyze mediators in position auctions, which use the first-arrival rule. We will define ex post equilibrium and the notion of implementation by mediation without explicitly modeling well-defined games. We will show that in this case 285 there is a way to implement the VCG outcome function in a self-price position auction. Moreover, we will find a valid mediator that does the job. 7. POSITION AUCTIONS WITH THE FIRST ARRIVAL RULE Let G be a position auction with the first-arrival rule. Every mediator for G has the ability to determine the order in which the bids he submits on behalf of the players are recorded; He can just submit the bids sequentially, waiting for a confirmation before submitting the next bid. We need the following notations. Every order of bidding can be described by some γ ∈ Γ; i bids before k if and only if γi < γk. Hence, an order of bids can serve as a priority rule. For every order of bids γ and a vector of bids b we define s(b, γ, i) as the position assigned to i. We denote the payment of i when the vector of bids is b and the order of bidding is γ by qi(b, γ) = ps(b,γ,i)(b), and we denote wi(vi, b, γ) the utility of i. A mediator for G should determine the bids of the players who use its services and also the order of bids as a function of the reported types. However, all mediators discussed in this paper will use the same rule to determine the order of bids: If all players report the vector of types ˆv, the mediator uses the order of bids γˆv , which is defined as follows: γˆv i < γˆv k if and only if ˆvi > ˆvk, or ˆvi = ˆvk and i < k. For example, if n = 3 and the reported types are ˆv = (6, 7, 6), then γˆv = (2, 1, 3). If only a strict subset of the players use the mediators services, the mediator applies the same order of bids rule to this subset. A mediator for a position auction with the first arrival rule is therefore defined by a vector m = (mS)S⊆N . However, such a mediator is called a directed mediator in order to stress the fact that it determines not only the bids but also the order of bids. To summarize: If all players use the directed mediator m, and the reported bids are ˆv, then the directed mediator bids mN (ˆv)i on behalf of i, i receives the position s(ˆv, γˆv , i), and pays qi(mN (ˆv), γˆv ). If only the subset S uses the mediators services, the reported types are ˆvS, and the other players bid directly b−S then the actual order of bids is not uniquely determined. If this order is γ then the position of i ∈ N is s(b, γ, i), and its payment is qi(b, γ), where b = (mS(ˆvS), b−S). In particular, if every player is using the T-strategy and the players profile of types is v, then the outcome generated by the directed mediator is ψm (v) = (s(v, γv ), q(mN (v), γv ). But why should the players use the T strategy? Assume all players but i use the T strategy. If player i deviates from the T strategy by reporting a false type to the directed mediator, the resulting outcome is well-defined. On the other hand, when this player sends a bid directly to the auctioneer, the resulting outcome is not clear, because the order of bids is not clear.11 A good desired directed mediator would be one that no player would want to deviate from the T strategy independently of the order in which the bids are recorded because of his deviation. More specifically: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the firstarrival rule, and let m be a directed mediator for G. The 11 It is clear however, that the resulting order γ is consistent with the well-defined order of bids of N \\ i. T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium with respect to m if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: F1: i is not better off when he gives the directed mediator the right of play and reports a false type. That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i), γ(ˆvi,v−i) ). F2: i is not better off when he bids directly independently of the resulting order of recorded bids. That is for every bi ∈ Bi, and for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the order of bids of members of N \\ i resulting from the vector of types v−i, wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\\i(v−i)), γ). The notion of valid directed mediators is analogously defined: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the firstarrival rule. A directed mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a non-negative level of utility. Formally, a directed mediator m for G is valid, if for every player i with type vi, for every subset S ⊆ N such that i ∈ S, for every vS\\i, and for every b−S, wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S, γ) ≥ 0 for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the standard order of bids of S determined by the mediator when the reported types are vS. The notion of implementation by mediation remains as before: The directed mediator m implements the VCG outcome function in G if ψm = ϕvcg . Our previous results remain true for directed mediators for position auctions with the first arrival rule. Next we show that in contrast to Theorem 6, it is possible to implement the VCG outcome function in every self-price position auction with the first-arrival rule. Theorem 7. Let G = G(α, p) be the self-price position auction with the first arrival rule. There exists a valid directed mediator that implements the VCG outcome function in G. In the following theorem we provide sufficient conditions for implementing that the VCG outcome function in a position auction with the first-arrival rule. A special characteristic of auctions satisfying these sufficient conditions is that players payments may depend also on their own bid, in contrast to the auctions discussed in Theorem 3. The long proof of this theorem is in the spirit of all previous proofs, and therefore it is omitted. Theorem 8. Let G = G(α, p) be a position auction with the first-arrival rule. If the following conditions hold then there exists a valid directed mediator for G that implements the VCG outcome function in G. 1. For every v ∈ V there exists b ∈ B such that pj(b) = v(j) for every j ∈ K. 2. G is monotone. 3. pj(b) ≥ pj+1(b) for every j ∈ K and every b ∈ B. 4. For every j ∈ K and every b1 , b2 ∈ B such that b1 (l) = b2 (l) for every l ≥ j, pj(b1 ) = pj(b2 ). 286 8. REFERENCES [1] R.J. Aumann. Subjectivity and correlation in randomized strategies.

Sin embargo, un mediador no puede hacer cumplir el uso de sus servicios, y cada agente es libre de participar en el juego directamente. En este artículo presentamos un estudio de mediadores para juegos con información incompleta y lo aplicamos al contexto de las subastas de posición, un tema central en el comercio electrónico. Las subastas de posición de VCG, que actualmente no se usan en la práctica, poseen algunas propiedades teóricas agradables, como la optimización del excedente social y las estrategias dominantes. Estas propiedades pueden no estar satisfechas por las subastas de posición actuales y sus variantes. Por lo tanto, nos concentramos en la búsqueda de mediadores que permitirán transformar las subastas de posición actuales en subastas de posición de VCG. Requerimos que aceptar los servicios mediadores, e informar honestamente al mediador, formará un ex equilibrio posterior, que satisface la siguiente condición de racionalidad: un pago de agentes no puede ser negativo independientemente de las acciones tomadas por los agentes que no eligieron los mediadoresservicios, o por los agentes que informan tipos falsos al mediador. Probamos la existencia de tales mediadores deseados para las subastas de posición en el próximo precio (tipo Google), así como para una clase más rica de subastas de posición, incluidas todas las subastas de posición de precio K, K> 1. Para K = 1, la subasta de posición de auto-precio, mostramos que la existencia de dicho mediador depende de la regla de ruptura de la corbata utilizada en la subasta.

Introducción Considere una interacción en un sistema de múltiples agentes, en el que cada jugador posee información privada, que se llama tipo de jugadores. Por ejemplo, en una interacción de subasta, el tipo de jugador es su valoración o, en subastas más complejas, su función de valoración. Cada jugador tiene un conjunto de acciones, y una estrategia de un jugador es una función que asigna cada uno de sus posibles tipos a una acción. Esta interacción se modela como un juego con información incompleta. Este juego se llama un juego bayesiano, cuando se agrega una medida de probabilidad comúnmente conocida en los perfiles de los tipos al sistema. De lo contrario, se llama un juego pre-bayesiano. En este artículo solo tratamos con los juegos pre-bayesianos. El concepto de solución líder para los juegos pre-bayesianos es el Ejilibrio de la publicación ex: un perfil de estrategias, uno para cada jugador, de modo que ningún jugador tiene una desviación rentable independientemente de los tipos de los otros jugadores. Considere el siguiente ejemplo simple de un juego pre-bayesiano, que posee un EX Post Equilibrio. El juego se denota por H. A B A 5, 2 3, 0 B 0, 0 4, 2 A A B A 2, 2 0, 0 B 3, 3 5, 2 B En el Juego H Hay dos jugadores. Ambos jugadores pueden elegir entre dos acciones: A y B. El reproductor de columna, Jugador 2, tiene un tipo privado, A o B (el jugador 1 tiene solo un tipo posible). Una estrategia del jugador 1 es G1, donde G1 = A o G1 = b. Una estrategia del jugador 2 es una función G2: {A, B} → {A, B}. Es decir, el jugador 2 tiene 4 estrategias. En este juego, el perfil de estrategia (G1, G2) es un EXP Post Equilibrium, donde G1 = B y G2 (A) = B, G2 (B) = A. Desafortunadamente, los juegos pre-bayesianos no poseen, en general, ex equilibrio después de la publicación, incluso si permitimos estrategias mixtas. Para abordar este problema, sugerimos en este documento el uso de mediadores. Un mediador es una entidad confiable que puede interactuar con los jugadores y actuar en su nombre en un juego determinado. Sin embargo, un mediador no puede hacer cumplir el comportamiento. De hecho, un agente es libre de participar en el juego sin la ayuda del mediador. El comportamiento de los mediadores en nombre de los agentes que le dan el derecho de juego se especifica previamente, y está condicionado a la información que los agentes proporcionarían al mediador. Esta noción es altamente natural;En muchos sistemas hay alguna forma de parte confiable o 279 administrador que se puede utilizar como mediador. La forma más simple de un mediador discutido en la literatura de la teoría del juego es capturada por la noción de equilibrio correlacionado [1]. Esta noción fue generalizada al equilibrio de comunicación en [5, 15]. Otro tipo de mediadores se discute en [13]. Sin embargo, en todos estos entornos, el mediador no puede realizar acciones en nombre de los agentes que lo permiten hacerlo. Los mediadores que pueden obtener el derecho de juego pero que no pueden hacer cumplir el uso de sus servicios ya se han definido y discutido para juegos con información completa en [14] .1 El tema de los mediadores para los juegos con información completa se ha generalizado y analizado en[dieciséis]. En este artículo presentamos otro uso de mediadores, al establecer comportamientos que sean estables contra desviaciones unilaterales en juegos con información incompleta. Observe que suponemos que se da la interacción múltiple de agente (formalizada como un juego), y todo lo que el mediador puede hacer es realizar acciones en nombre de los agentes que explícitamente lo permiten hacerlo.2 para ilustrar el poder deLos mediadores para los juegos con información incompleta consideran el siguiente Juego Gayesiano G que no posee un EX Post Equilibrio. En g, el reproductor de columna tiene dos tipos posibles: a y B. a b a 5, 2 3, 0 b 0, 0 2, 2 a a b a 2, 2 0, 0 b 3, 0 5, 2 b Un mediador para g debe especificarLas acciones que elegirá en nombre de los jugadores que le dan el derecho de jugar. Si el jugador 2 quiere darle al mediador el derecho de jugar, también debe informar un tipo. Considere el siguiente mediador: si ambos jugadores le dan al mediador el derecho de juego, entonces el mediador jugará en su nombre (a, a) si el jugador 2 informa A y (b, b) si el jugador 2 informa B. Si solo el Jugador 1 le da al mediador el derecho de juego, entonces el mediador elegirá A en su nombre. Si solo el jugador 2 le da al mediador el derecho de juego, el mediador elegirá la acción A (resp. B) en su nombre, si B (resp. A) ha sido reportado. El mediador genera un nuevo juego pre-bayesiano, que se llama el juego mediado. En el juego mediado, el jugador 1 tiene tres acciones: darle al mediador el derecho de juego, denotado por M, o jugar directamente a o b. El jugador 2 tiene cuatro acciones: M - A, M - B, A, B, donde M - A (M - B) significa informar A (b) al mediador y darle el derecho de juego. El juego mediado se describe en la siguiente figura: m - a m - b a b m 5, 2 2, 2 5, 2 3, 0 A 3, 0 5, 2 5, 2 3, 0 B 2, 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 2, 2 a 1 para juegos con información completa El interés principal es en los principales agentes de los comportamientos, que son estables contra las desviaciones por las coaliciones. Ya se discutió un caso especial de mediadores en [8]. En este artículo, los autores discutieron mediadores para un juego de dos personas, que los jugadores conocen pero no para los mediadores, y buscaron el equilibrio de Nash en el nuevo juego generado por el mediador.2 Este entorno natural es diferente del discutido en las teorías clásicas de la implementación y el diseño del mecanismo, donde un diseñador diseña un nuevo juego desde cero para producir algún comportamiento deseado.m - a m - b a b m 2, 2 5, 2 2, 2 0, 0 a 0, 0 2, 2 2, 2 0, 0 b 5, 2 3, 0 3, 0 5, 2 B ahora es fácilVerificar que darle al mediador el derecho de juego e informar sinceramente es un equilibrio ex post en el juego mediado. Es decir, (F1, F2) es un EXP Post Equilibrium, donde F1 = M y F2 (A) = M - A, F2 (B) = M - B. El proposito de este papel es en dos sentidos. Introducimos mediadores para juegos con información incompleta y los aplicamos en el contexto de las subastas de posición. Nuestra elección de las subastas de posiciones como dominio de la aplicación no es un accidente;De hecho, las subastas de posiciones se han convertido en un tema central en la publicidad y la selección de subastas de posición apropiadas para esa tarea es un tema de una cantidad considerable de estudio [17, 3, 9, 4] .3 Las subastas de posición actuales, sin embargo, no poseen ex postEquilibrio, es decir, soluciones que son estables contra desviaciones unilaterales, independientemente de la información privada de los agentes, ni garantizan un excedente social óptimo. Por el contrario, en la subasta de posición de VCG, que actualmente no se usa en la práctica, hay un ex equilibrio de la verdad que revela la verdad, que produce un excedente óptimo. Por lo tanto, sugerimos el uso de mediadores para intentar e implementar la salida de la subasta de posición de VCG, transformando otras subastas de posición (en particular) en una subasta de posición VCG.4 Más específicamente, el juego mediado tendrá un ex postEquilibrio, que genera el resultado de la subasta de posición de VCG. Uno de esos mediadores ya se ha discutido para otros fines en la literatura: se construyó un tipo de algoritmo de subasta en inglés en [3] que toma como una entrada las valoraciones de los jugadores y emiten ofertas para la subasta de posición en el siguiente precio. Se probó allí que informar el tipo verdadero a este algoritmo por cada jugador forma un EXP Post Equilibrium, que genera el resultado de VCG. En nuestro idioma, este algoritmo puede considerarse casi como un mediador para la subasta de posición de próxima precio que implementa la función de resultado de VCG. Lo que falta es un componente que castiga a los jugadores que envían sus ofertas directamente al subastador, y una prueba de que usar los servicios mediadores e informar el tipo verdadero por cada jugador es un ex equilibrio post en el juego mediado definido por el algoritmo y porel componente adicional. Un mediador puede generar un resultado deseado al castigar a los jugadores que no usan sus servicios con ofertas muy altas por parte de los jugadores que usan sus servicios. Creemos que tales mediadores no son realistas y, por lo tanto, nos concentramos en la búsqueda de mediadores válidos que generen un ex equilibrio posterior y satisfagan la condición de racionalidad adicional: los agentes de pago no pueden ser negativos independientemente de las acciones tomadas por los agentes que no lo hicieron.Elija los servicios de mediadores o los agentes que informan tipos falsos al mediador. Probamos la existencia de tales mediadores deseados para las subastas de posición del próximo precio (tipo Google), así como para una clase más rica de subastas de posición, incluidas todas las subastas de posición de precio K, k> 1. Para K = 1, la subasta de posición de auto-precio, mostramos que el EX3 ver también [12], donde las subastas de posición se titulan subastas de anuncios.4 En general, a excepción de la subasta de posición de VCG, no esperamos que las subastas de posición posean un ex equilibrio después del equilibrio (ver nota 7).5 Nuestra prueba utiliza un algoritmo, que es diferente del algoritmo en [3] discutido anteriormente.280 ITENCIA de dicho mediador depende de la regla de ruptura de corbata utilizada en la subasta. Los mediadores en subastas de un elemento (en particular las subastas de primer precio y segundo precio) ya se han discutido en [6, 11, 2];Sin embargo, todos usaron un modelo bayesiano. Las subastas de posición son un tipo restringido de juegos generales pre-bayesianos. En esta versión de la conferencia, hacemos la definición formal de mediadores e implementación por mediación para el caso especial de subastas de posición, y solo en la versión completa presentamos la teoría general de los mediadores para los juegos pre-bayesianos. La mayoría de las pruebas se omiten de esta versión de la conferencia.2. Subastas de posición en una subasta de posición Hay un vendedor que vende un número finito de posiciones j ∈ K = {1, ..., m}. Hay un número finito de postores (potenciales) I ∈ N = {1, ..., n}. Suponemos que hay más postores que posiciones, es decir, n> m.Las posiciones se venden por un período de tiempo fijo. Para cada posición j hay un número comúnmente conocido αJ> 0, que se interpreta como el número esperado de visitantes en esa posición.αJ se denomina tasa de posición de clic j. Suponemos que α1> α2> αM> 0. Si mantengo una posición, cada visitante de esta posición le da a I un ingreso de VI> 0, donde VI se llama valoración de i. El conjunto de posibles valoraciones de I es vi = (0, ∞). Suponemos que las funciones de utilidad de los jugadores son cuasilíneas. Es decir, si el jugador I es asignado a la posición J y paga pi por clic, entonces su utilidad es αJ (vi - pi). Se requiere que cada jugador envíe una oferta, bi ∈ Bi = [0, ∞). Suponemos que ofertar 0 es un símbolo para la no participación. Por lo tanto, un jugador con una oferta 0 no se asigna a ninguna posición, y paga 0. En todas las subastas de posición que consideramos, el jugador con la oferta positiva más alta recibe la primera posición, el jugador con la segunda oferta positiva más alta recibe la segunda posición, etc. Es útil definir para cada subasta de posición dos posiciones ficticias M + 1 y −1, a las que se puede asignar más de un jugador. Todos los jugadores, que participan en la subasta pero no obtienen una posición en K, se asignan a la posición M + 1 y todos los jugadores que eligen no participar están asignados a la posición −1. También definimos αM+1 = α - 1 = 0. Una tarea de jugadores a posiciones se llama asignación. Por lo tanto, una asignación es un vector S = (S1, S2, · · · ·, Sn) con Si ∈ K ∪ {−1, M + 1} de modo que si Si ∈ K entonces SI = SL para cada l = i;SI es la posición del jugador i. Dado lo anterior, una subasta de posición se define por su regla de ruptura de corbata, que determina la asignación en caso de lazos y por su esquema de pago. Estos se discuten a continuación.2.1 Las reglas de ruptura de la práctica en la práctica, la regla de ruptura de empate más comúnmente utilizada es la primera regla de llegada: si un conjunto de jugadores presentan la misma oferta, su prioridad al recibir las posiciones está determinada por las veces que se registraron sus ofertas;Una oferta anterior recibe una prioridad más alta. En la teoría de la subasta, esta regla de ruptura de vínculo se modela típicamente al suponer que el subastador está utilizando una regla de prioridad aleatoria. Más específicamente, que γ sea el conjunto de todas las permutaciones, γ = (γ1, ..., γn) de N. Cada γ define una regla de prioridad de la siguiente manera: I tiene una prioridad más alta que K si y solo si γi <γk. Cada vector de BIDS B y A Permutación γ determinan de manera única una asignación. Un subastador que está utilizando la regla de prioridad aleatoria elige una regla de prioridad fija γ al aleatorizar uniformemente sobre γ. Sin embargo, la regla de prioridad resultante no se cuenta a los jugadores antes de hacer sus ofertas. Cuando la regla de prioridad γ se cuenta a los jugadores antes de hacer sus ofertas, la regla de ruptura de empate se denomina regla de prioridad fija. Tratar con una regla de prioridad fija simplifica las anotaciones y las pruebas, y en la mayoría de los casos, y en particular en este documento, los resultados que se obtienen con esta regla de ruptura de vínculo son idénticos a los resultados obtenidos con la regla de prioridad aleatoria. Por lo tanto, asumiremos esta regla de ruptura de vínculo. Por el contrario, en la Sección 7 discutimos un enfoque no estándar para analizar directamente la regla de ruptura de empate de primera llegada. A menos que digamos específicamente de lo contrario, asumimos en este documento una regla de prioridad fija. Sin pérdida de generalidad, suponemos que la regla de prioridad fija está definida por el orden natural, ˜γ = (1, 2, ..., n). Es decir, el postor I tiene una prioridad más alta que el postor k si y solo si i <k.Dada esta regla de prioridad fija, podemos hacer las siguientes definiciones, que se aplican a todas las subastas de posición: denotamos por S (b, i) el jugador de posición I está asignado cuando el perfil de oferta es b. La asignación determinada por B se denota por S (B) = (S (B, 1), S (B, 2), · · ·, S (B, N)). Para cada j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} denotamos por δ (b, j) el conjunto de jugadores asignados a la posición j. Tenga en cuenta que para j ∈ K, δ (b, j) contiene como máximo un jugador.2.2 Los esquemas de pago dejan que α sea un vector de tasa de clics. Cada posición J ∈ K ∪ {−1, M + 1} está asociada con una función de pago, Pα J: B → R +, donde Pα J (b) es el pago de la posición J cuando el perfil de oferta es b. Naturalmente, suponemos que Pα −1 es idénticamente cero. Sin embargo, también suponemos que Pα M+1 es idénticamente cero. Por lo tanto, un participante al que no se le asigna una posición real no paga nada. Llamamos al vector de las funciones de pago Pα = (Pα J) j∈K el esquema de pago de posición. Observación: siempre que se fije α o su valor es claro en el contexto, nos permitiremos omitir el superíndice α del pago y otras funciones. Tratamos con los esquemas de pago de posición anónimo, es decir, los pagos de jugadores al subastador no están influenciados por sus identidades. Esto se modela de la siguiente manera: Sea B ∈ B = B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn sea un perfil de oferta. Denotamos por B (j) la JTH más alta oferta en b. Para j> n dejamos b (j) = 0. Por ejemplo, si b = (3, 7, 3, 0, 2) entonces b (1) = 7, b (2) = 3, b (3) = 3, b (4) = 2, b (5) =0. Denotamos b ∗ = (b (1), · · ·, b (n)). El anonimato se modela por el requisito de que para cada dos perfiles de oferta b, d ∈ B, p (b) = p (d) siempre que b ∗ = d ∗. Es decir, para cada posición j existe una función de valor real ˜pj definido sobre todos los vectores ordenados de ofertas de tal manera que para cada b ∈ B pj (b) = ˜pj (b ∗). Además, asumimos que un jugador nunca paga más que su oferta. Eso es PJ (b) ≤ b (j) por cada b ∈ B y para cada j ∈ K. Es conveniente en ciertos casos describir las funciones de pago indexadas por los jugadores. Sea G una subasta de posición con un esquema de pago de posición p.Para cada jugador i denotamos qi (b) = ps (b, i) (b), 281 y q (b) = (q1 (b), q2 (b), · · · qn (b)). Tenga en cuenta que la correspondencia P → Q es uno a uno. Llamamos a Q el esquema de pago del jugador. Todos nuestros supuestos sobre los esquemas de pago de posición pueden transformarse en supuestos análogos sobre los esquemas de pago del jugador. Por conveniencia, una subasta de posición se describirá por su esquema de pago de posición o por su esquema de pago de jugadores. La función de utilidad para el jugador I, WI: VI × B → R+ se define de la siguiente manera: WI (VI, B) = αS (B, I) (VI - Qi (B)) = αS (B, I) (VI -ps (b, i) (b)).2.3 Subastas de posición central A continuación, describimos los esquemas de pago de tres subastas de posición central. Subastas de posición de auto-precio: cada jugador que está asignado a una posición con una tasa de clic positiva paga su propia oferta. Es decir, por cada j ∈ K y cada b ∈ B pj (b) = b (j) (1) subastas de posición al siguiente precio: en esta subasta (ejecute con una ligera variación de Google), cada jugador que se asigna aUna posición con una tasa de clic positiva paga la oferta del jugador asignado a la posición justo después de él si hay un jugador de este tipo, y cero de lo contrario. Eso es para cada j ∈ K y para cada b ∈ B pj (b) = b (j+1) (2) subastas de posición de VCG: en una subasta de posición de Vickrey-Clarke (VCG) la función de pago para la posición j ∈K se define de la siguiente manera. 6 para cada b ∈ B pvcg j (b) = pm+1 k = j+1 b (k) (αk - 1 - αk) αJ (3) Tenga en cuenta que la subasta de posición de VCG no es laSubasta de posición del siguiente precio a menos que solo haya una posición y α1 = 1. 2.4 Mediadores para las subastas de posición que denotamos por g = g (α, p) la subasta de posición con el vector de tasa de clics α y el esquema de pago p.Recuerde que el conjunto de tipos de I es vi = (0, ∞). Sea v = v1 × v2 × · · · × vn el conjunto de perfil de tipos, y para cada s ⊆ n vs = × i∈Svi. Un mediador para G es un vector de funciones M = (MS) S⊆n, donde MS: VS → BS. El mediador M genera un juego GM prebayesiano, que se llama juego mediado. En este juego, cada jugador recibe su tipo VI y puedo enviar un tipo, ˆVI (no necesariamente el tipo verdadero) al mediador, o enviar una oferta directamente a la subasta. Si S es el conjunto de jugadores que envían un tipo al mediador, el mediador ofrece en su nombre MS (ˆVS). Por lo tanto, el conjunto de acción del jugador I en el juego mediado es bi ∪Vi, donde convenientemente VI denota tanto, (0, ∞) como una copia de (0, ∞), que es disjunto de 6, usamos la función de pago estándardel mecanismo VCG. Se puede obtener un mecanismo de VCG general del estándar agregando una función de pago adicional a cada jugador, que depende solo de los tipos de otros jugadores. Algunos autores (ver, por ejemplo, [7]) llaman al mecanismo VCG estándar, el mecanismo de VC. Según esta terminología, realmente tratamos con subastas de posición de VC. Sin embargo, decidimos usar la terminología más común. Bi. Presentamos la siguiente terminología: la estrategia T para un jugador en el juego mediado es la estrategia, en la que este jugador usa los servicios de mediadores e informa su verdadero valor al mediador. El perfil T-Strategy es el perfil de las estrategias en las que cada jugador está utilizando el T-Strategy. El perfil T-Strategy es un equilibrio ex post en el juego mediado si para cada jugador I y Tipo VI, y para cada vector de tipos de otros jugadores, v-I, las siguientes dos condiciones se mantienen: E1: No es mejorAfortunado cuando le da al mediador el derecho de juego e informa un tipo falso. Es decir, por cada ˆVi ∈ Vi Wi (VI, Mn (VI, V - I)) ≥ Wi (VI, Mn (ˆVi, V - I)). E2: No estoy mejor cuando él ofrece directamente. Eso es para cada bi ∈ Bi, wi (vi, mn (vi, v - i)) ≥ wi (vi, (bi, mn \\ i (v -))). Cada vez que el perfil de estrategy T es un Ej.)), Q (mn (v)). Por lo tanto, el rango de la función ϕm es el producto cartesiano del conjunto de asignaciones con RN +.3. Implementación de la función de resultado de VCG por mediación en general, excepto por la subasta de posición de VCG, no esperamos que las subastas de posición posean un ex equilibrio después depuede formar una asignación no eficiente: una asignación que no maximiza el excedente social. Por el contrario, en la subasta de posición de VCG, la estrategia de reportaje de la verdad es una estrategia dominante para cada jugador, y la asignación resultante es eficiente. Dada una subasta de posición, nuestro objetivo es construir un mediador que implementaría la función de resultado de la subasta de posición de VCG. Esta función de resultado se define de la siguiente manera: ϕvcg (v) = (s (v), qvcg (v)). Definición: Sea G una subasta de posición. Sea M un mediador para G. Decimos que la M implementa la función de resultado de VCG en g, o que implementa ϕvcg en g si el perfil tstrategy es un ex equilibrio post en gm, y ϕm = ϕvcg. Demostramos nuestras definiciones hasta ahora con un ejemplo simple: Ejemplo 1. Considere una subasta de auto-precio G = G (α, P) con 2 jugadores y una posición, con α1 = 1. Es decir, G es una subasta estándar de primer precio de dos personas. La subasta de posición VCG correspondiente es una subasta estándar de segundo precio. Definimos una familia de mediadores MC, C ≥ 1, cada uno de ellos implementa la subasta de posición de VCG. Suponga que los dos 7 en realidad, se puede demostrar que si un perfil de estrategia B en una subasta de posición es un Ej. Se conjetura comúnmente que, excepto por algunas subastas combinatorias extremadamente artificiales, las subastas combinatorias VCG son las únicas con estrategias dominantes (ver [10]).282 Los jugadores usan los servicios de mediadores y le envían los tipos ˆv = (ˆv1, ˆv2), entonces todos los mediadores actúan de manera similar y de la siguiente manera: si ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 el mediador hace las siguientes ofertas en nombre de los jugadores: B1 = ˆv2 y B2 y B2 y B2= 0. Si ˆv2> ˆv1, el mediador hace las ofertas b1 = 0, b2 = ˆv1. Si solo un jugador usa los servicios mediadores, digamos el jugador I, entonces el mediador MC ofrece bi = cˆvi en nombre de i. Afirmamos que por cada c> 1, el perfil de la estrategia T es un ex equilibrio después del juego mediado generado por MC. De hecho, suponga que el jugador 2 informa su tipo V2 al mediador, y considere el jugador 1. Si V1 ≥ V2, mediante el uso del Jugador T-Strategy 1 recibe la posición y paga V2. Por lo tanto, la utilidad 1S es V1 −v2. Si el jugador 1 se desvía utilizando los servicios de mediadores e informes ˆv1 ≥ v2, su utilidad todavía es v1 - v2. Si informa ˆv1 <v2, su utilidad será 0. Si el jugador 1 no usa el mediador, debe ofertar al menos CV2 para obtener las posiciones y, por lo tanto, su utilidad no puede exceder V1 - V2. Si v1 <v2, entonces la estrategia T produce 0 al jugador 1, y cualquier otra estrategia produce una utilidad no positiva. Obviamente, cada uno de los mediadores MC implementa la función de resultado de VCG. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que la estrategia T no es una estrategia dominante cuando c> 1;p.ej.Si V1> V2 y el jugador 2 ofrecen directamente V2 (sin usar los servicios de mediador), entonces ofertar directamente V1 es mejor para el jugador 1 que usar la Tstrategy: en la antigua utilidad del jugador del casos 1 es 0 y en el último caso, su utilidad es negativa negativa. Es interesante observar que este simple ejemplo no se puede extender a las subastas generales de posición de auto-precio, como se discutirá en la Sección 4. Mientras que cada uno de los mediadores MC en el Ejemplo 1 implementa la función de resultado de VCG, el mediador con C = 1 tiene una característica distinta: un jugador que usa la estrategia T no puede obtener una utilidad negativa. En contraste, por cada c> 1, si, por ejemplo, el jugador 2 no usa los servicios mediadores, participa directamente y ofrece menos que CV1, entonces la estrategia T produce una utilidad negativa de (1-c) V1 al jugador 1. Esto motiva nuestra definición de mediadores válidos: sea una subasta de posición. Un mediador para G es válido, si para cada jugador, el uso de la estrategia T garantiza un nivel de utilidad no negativo. Formalmente, un mediador M para G, es válido si para cada subconjunto S ⊆ n y cada jugador i ∈ S wi (vi, ms (vs), b --s) ≥ 0 por cada b - s ∈ B - S y cada vs∈ Vs.4. Mediadores en las subastas de posición en el próximo precio ahora mostramos que existe un mediador válido, lo que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en las subastas de posición de próxima precio. Aunque en la siguiente sección demostramos un resultado más general, presentamos este resultado primero, dada la importancia de las subastas de posición al siguiente precio en la literatura y en la práctica. Nuestra prueba utiliza el siguiente lema técnico. Lema 1. Deje que PVCG sea el esquema de pago VCG.1. PVCG J (B) ≤ B (J+1) para cada j ∈ K. 2. PVCG J (B) ≥ PVCG J+1 (b) por cada j = 1, ..., m - 1 y paraCada b ∈ B, donde para cada j, la igualdad se mantiene si y solo si b (j+1) = b (j+2) = · · · = b (m+1). La prueba de Lemma 1 se da en la versión completa. Ahora podemos mostrar: Teorema 2. Sea G una subasta de posición de próximo precio. Existe un mediador válido que implementa ϕvcg en G. El teorema 2 se deriva de un teorema más general dado en la siguiente sección. Sin embargo, todavía proporcionamos una prueba ya que se construye un mediador más simple e intuitivo para este caso. Prueba del teorema 2. Definimos un mediador m, que implementará la función de resultado de VCG en G: para cada v ∈ V, dejen mn (v) = b (v), donde b (v) se define de la siguiente manera: para cada jugador i tal que 2 ≤s (v, i) ≤ m deje bi (v) = pvcg s (v, i) −1 (v) .8 por cada i ∈ δ (v, m + 1), bi (v) = pvcg m (v). Sea Bδ (V, 1) (V) = 1 + Max {I: S (V, I) ≥2} Bi (V). Para cada s ⊆ n tal que s = n y para cada vs ∈ VS vs ms (v) = vs. Esto completa la descripción del mediador m.Mostramos que ϕm (v) = ϕvcg (v) para cada v ∈ V. Deje que V ∈ V sea un vector de valoración arbitraria. Tenemos que mostrar que s (b (v)) = s (v) y que q (b (v)) = qvcg (v): comenzamos mostrando que s (b (v)) = s (v). Es suficiente mostrar que cada vez que 1 ≤ s (v, i) <s (v, l) ≤ m + 1 para algunos i = l, entonces s (b (v), i) <s (b (v),l). Primero lo mostramos para S (V, I) = 1, es decir, δ (V, 1) = I. En este caso, Bδ (v, 1) (v)> bj (v) para cada j = i, s (b (v), i) = 1. Por lo tanto, S (B (V), I) <S (B (V), L). Si S (V, I)> 1, distinguimos entre dos casos.1. vi = vl. Dado que s (v, i) <s (v, l), la regla de prioridad fija implica que i <l.Por la segunda parte de Lemma 1, PVCG S (V, I) −1 (V) ≥ PVCG S (V, L) −1 (V). Por lo tanto, BI (V) ≥ BL (V), que produce S (B (V), I) <S (B (V), L).2. VI> VL. Deje j + 1 = s (v, i). Eso es V (J+1) = VI, y por lo tanto por la segunda parte de Lemma 1, PVCG S (V, I) −1 (V)> PVCG S (V, I) (V). Dado que S (V, I) ≤ S (V, L) - 1, por la segunda parte de Lemma 1, PVCG S (V, I) (V) ≥ PVCG S (V, L) −1 (V). Por lo tanto, PVCG S (V, I) −1 (V)> PVCG S (V, L) −1 (V), que produce BI (V)> BL (V). Por lo tanto, S (B (V), I) <S (B (V), L). Esto completa la prueba de que s (b (v)) = s (v) para todos v ∈ V. Observe que para cada jugador i tal que s (b (v), i) ∈ K ps (b (v), i) (b (v)) = pvcg s (v, i) (v). Por lo tanto, qi (b (v)) = qvcg i (v) para cada i ∈ N. Esto muestra que q (b (v)) = qvcg (v) para todos v ∈ V. Por lo tanto, ϕm = ϕvcg. Procedemos a demostrar que la estrategia T es un equilibrio ex post. Tenga en cuenta que, por la veracidad de VCG, no es beneficioso que cualquier jugador que me pierda informara su valor al mediador, dado que todos los demás jugadores usan la estrategia T. A continuación, mostramos que no es beneficioso para un solo jugador I ∈ N participar en la subasta directamente si todos los demás jugadores usan la estrategia T. Corrige algunos v ∈ V. Suponga que el jugador I es el único jugador que participa directamente en la subasta. Por lo tanto, V - I es el vector de ofertas presentadas por el mediador. Deja que Bi sea jugador es una oferta. Sea k = s (v, i). Por lo tanto, desde ϕm = ϕvcg, S (B (V), i) = k.Let J Be Player es posición en la desviación. Por lo tanto, j = s ((v - i, bi), i). Si j /∈ K, el jugador es 8 recuerda que S (b, i) denota la posición del jugador I bajo el perfil de oferta b, y δ (b, j) denota el conjunto de jugadores asignados a la posición j. Cada vez que j ∈ K, abusamos ligeramente de las anotaciones, y también nos referimos a δ (B, J) como el jugador asignado a la posición j.283 La utilidad es cero y, por lo tanto, desviar no vale la pena para i. Suponga j ∈ K. Entonces αk (vi - pk (b (v))) = αk (vi - pvcg k (v)) ≥ αJ (vi - pvcg j (v - i, bi)) ≥ αJ (vi - v - v(j+1)), donde la primera igualdad se deduce de ϕm = ϕvcg, la primera desigualdad sigue ya que VCG es veraz, y la segunda desigualdad se deduce de la primera parte del Lema 1. Dado que PJ es la función de pago JS JS en la subasta de posición del siguiente precio, αJ (VI-V (J+1)) = αJ (VI-PJ (V-I, BI)). Por lo tanto, αK (VI - PK (B (V)) ≥ αJ (VI - PJ (V - I, BI)). Por lo tanto, el jugador I no gana al participar directamente en la subasta. Finalmente mostramos que M es válido. Si todos los jugadores eligen el mediador, entonces en la primera parte de Lemma 1, cada jugador que usa el T-Strategy no pagará más que su valor. Considere la situación en la que un subconjunto de jugadores, s, participa directamente en la subasta. Dado que el mediador presenta los valores informados en nombre de los otros jugadores, estos otros jugadores no pagarán más que sus valores informados. Por lo tanto, un jugador que usó el T-Strategy no pagará más que su valor.2 5. Mediadores en subastas generalizadas de posición de NextPrice En la sección anterior, discutimos la implementación de la función de resultado de VCG en la siguiente subasta de posición de precio. En esta sección, tratamos con una familia más general de subastas de posición, en la que el pago de cada jugador al que se le ha asignado un puesto, es una función de las ofertas de los jugadores asignados a posiciones más bajas que las suyas. El esquema de pago P de dicha posición subasta satisface la siguiente condición: n1: para cada j ∈ K y cada b1, b2 ∈ B tal que b1 (l) = b2 (l) para cada l> j, tenemos ese pj (B1) = PJ (B2). A continuación, proporcionamos condiciones suficientes para implementar la función de resultado de VCG por un mediador válido en las subastas de posición cuyos esquemas de pago satisfacen N1. Necesitamos la siguiente notación y definición. Para cada subasta de posición G y cada b ∈ B, dejen ϕg (b) = (s (b), q (b)). Decimos que G es una cubierta V CG si para cada v ∈ V existe b ∈ B de tal manera que ϕg (b) = ϕvcg (v). Decimos que G es monótono si pj (b) ≥ pj (b) para cada j ∈ K y por cada b ≥ b, donde b ≥ b si y solo si bi ≥ bi por cada i ∈ N. ahora podemosMostrar: Teorema 3. Sea G = G (α, P) una subasta de posición tal que P satisface N1. Si las siguientes condiciones se mantienen, existe un mediador válido que implementa ϕvcg en G: 1. G es una cubierta V CG 2. G es monótono. La prueba del teorema 3 se da en la versión completa. A continuación, proporcionamos la construcción del mediador válido, que implementará la función de resultado de VCG en una subasta de posición G, que satisface las condiciones del teorema 3: algoritmo para la construcción M para g: • Para cada v ∈ V dejar mn (v) = = = =b (v), donde b (v) es un perfil de oferta tal que ϕg (b (v)) = ϕvcg (v) • Para cada i y por cada v - i ∈ V - i, vaya Vi = (V - I, M (v - i)), donde m (v - i) = 1 + maxj = ivj.• Por cada i ∈ N y cada v - i ∈ V - i, deje mn \\ {i} (v - i) = b - i (vi), donde b (vi) es un perfil de oferta tal que ϕg (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b (vi)) = ϕvcg (vi).• Para cada s ⊆ n, de modo que 1 ≤ | S |≤ N - 2, Sea MS (VS) = vs. Observación: Como escribimos, el Teorema 3 se aplica en particular a las subastas de posición de próximo precio discutidas en la Sección 4. Sin embargo, este teorema se aplica a muchas otras subastas de posición interesantes como se mostrará más adelante. Además, el mediador construido para este caso general es diferente de la de la prueba del teorema 2. Ahora mostramos que la Condición N1, así como el requisito de que G sea una cubierta V CG, y el requisito de que G sea Monótono sea necesario para establecer nuestro resultado. Es fácil ver que si G no es una cubierta V CG, el Teorema 3 no se mantiene. El siguiente ejemplo muestra la necesidad de la condición de monotonicidad. Ejemplo 4. Sea G = G (α, P) la siguiente subasta de posición. Sea n = 4, m = 3, α = (100, 10, 1), p1 (b) = b (2) - b (3) y p2 (b) = b (3)+b (4) 2,y p3 (b) = b (4). Observe que G no es monótono. Observe que la condición N1 está satisfecha. En la versión completa, mostramos que G es una cubierta V CG, y no es posible implementar la función de resultado de VCG en G con un mediador válido. El siguiente ejemplo muestra que el teorema 3 no se mantiene, cuando la condición N1 no se satisface. Ejemplo 5. Sea G = G (α, P) la siguiente subasta de posición. Sea n = {1, 2, 3}, k = {1, 2} y α = (2, 1). Deje p1 (b) = b (1) 4 y p2 (b) = b (2). Es inmediato ver que la condición de monotonicidad está satisfecha. Luego mostramos que G es una cubierta V CG. Deje que V ∈ V sea un vector de valoración arbitraria. Necesitamos encontrar un perfil de oferta b (v) tal que ϕg (b (v)) = ϕvcg (v). Tenga en cuenta que PVCG 1 (V) = V (2)+V (3) 2 y PVCG 2 (V) = V (3). Definimos el perfil de oferta B (v) de la siguiente manera. Sea Bδ (V, 3) (V) = V (3) 2, Bδ (V, 2) (V) = V (3) y Bδ (V, 1) (V) = 2V2 + 2V (3). Por la construcción de B (V), S (B (V), I) = S (V, I) para i = 1, 2, 3. Además, observe que PJ (B (V)) = PVCG J (V) para J = 1, 2, 3, 4. Por lo tanto, ϕg (b (v)) = ϕvcg (v). Como V es arbitrario, G es una cubierta V CG. Naturalmente, N1 no está satisfecho. Supongamos en la negación que existe un mediador válido M, que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en G. Considere el siguiente vector de valoraciones V = (12, 10, 8). Si todos los jugadores usan el mediador, entonces el jugador 2 (con la valoración 10) obtiene la posición 2, paga 8 y, por lo tanto, su utilidad es 1 (10−8) = 2. El jugador 2 siempre puede ofertar más que los otros jugadores, y eso hace que otro jugador se coloque en segundo lugar;Dado que se requiere que el mediador sea válido, debe ser que el mediador presente no más de 12 en nombre de los jugadores 1 y 3. Pero entonces el jugador 2 puede ofertar 13 y ganar la primera posición;Por lo tanto, la utilidad del jugador 2S será 2 (10 - 13 4)> 8. Esto contradice que M es un mediador válido que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en G. Para resumir, hemos mostrado condiciones suficientes para transformar una gran clase de subastas de posición a la subasta de posición V CG 284 por mediación. Además, dejando caer cualquiera de nuestras condiciones, obtenemos que tal transformación podría no ser factible. En las siguientes subsecciones, proporcionamos clases de subastas de posición interesantes que pueden transformarse en la subasta de posición de VCG por mediación. Estas subastas satisfacen las condiciones del teorema 3. Sin embargo, para usar el Teorema 3, uno tiene que verificar que una determinada subasta de posición, G sea una cubierta VCG. En el documento de la versión completa, antes de aplicar este teorema, presentamos otro teorema útil que proporciona condiciones suficientes que garantizan que G es una cubierta VCG.5.1 Subastas generalizadas de posición en el próximo precio en una subasta generalizada del próximo precio El esquema de pago es de la siguiente forma. Para cada j ∈ K y para cada b ∈ B pj (b) = b (l (j)) donde l (j) es un entero tal que l (j)> j.9. Mostramos: Proposición 1. Sea G una subasta generalizada de posición de próxima posición. Existe un mediador válido que implementa ϕvcg en g si y solo si las siguientes dos condiciones se mantienen: (i) L (j + 1)> l (j) para j = 1, ..., m - 1 y (ii) l (m) ≤ n.5.2 Subastas de posición de precio k-next en subastas de posición de precio k-next El esquema de pago se define de la siguiente manera: para cada j ∈ K y por cada b pj (b) = b (j+k). Las subastas de posición de precio k-next son, en particular las subastas generalizadas de posición de la posición al siguiente precio. Por lo tanto, la Proposición 1 cede como corolario: Proposición 2. Sea k ≥ 1. Deje que G sea una subasta de posición de precio de K-Next. Existe un mediador válido que implementa ϕvcg en g si y solo si n ≥ m + k-1. 5.3 subastas de posición de próxima precio ponderadas en subastas de posición de próximo precio ponderadas Los esquemas de pago son de la siguiente forma. Para cada j ∈ K y para cada b ∈ B, PJ (B) = B (J+1) CJ, donde CJ ≥ 1. Proposición 3. Deje que G sea una subasta ponderada de posición de próxima precio con los pesos C1, C2, ..., cm. Existe un mediador válido que implementa ϕvcg en g si y solo si c1 ≥ · · · ≥ cm.5.4 Subastas de posición de Google tipo Google Las subastas de anuncios de Google son ligeramente diferentes de la subasta NextPrice. En estas subastas, la tasa de clics de un AD I en la posición J es el producto de la calidad de AD I, βi> 0, y la tasa de clasificación de clic de posición αJ> 0.10 jugadores se clasifica en las posiciones por BIβI. Sea b ∈ B. Sea ˜δ (b, j) definido como sigue. Para cada j ∈ K, deje que ˜δ (b, j) sea el jugador I que obtiene la posición J, y para j = m deja ˜δ (b, j) = i, donde obtuve la posición m en caso de que haya más deUn jugador I tal que bi = b (m), luego se elige entre ellos a través de la regla de ruptura ˜γ. Si el jugador I obtiene la posición J ∈ K, entonces ella paga PJ (b) = β˜δ (b, j+1) biendr (b, j+1) βi. Por lo tanto, el jugador es la utilidad será αJβi (VI - Bight (b, j+1) βi βi β˜δ (b, j+1)) = αJ (Viβi - bi − bi − b, b, j+1) β˜δ(b, j+1)).9 Recuerde que b (j) = 0 para cada j> n 10 ver, p.[17]. Por lo tanto, al denotar ˜Vi = Viβi por cada i ∈ N, y al aplicar el Teorema 2 obtenemos: Proposición 4. Existe un mediador válido que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en la subasta de posición similar a Google.6. Las subastas de posición de auto-precio dejan que G sea una subasta de posición de auto-precio como se describe en la Sección 2. En el Ejemplo 1 demostramos que cuando hay una posición y dos jugadores, la función de resultado de VCG es implementada por un mediador válido en esta subasta. La prueba en este ejemplo se puede generalizar fácilmente para mostrar que la función de resultado de VCG puede ser implementada por un mediador válido en una subasta de posición de auto-precio, en la que hay una posición y un número arbitrario de jugadores, n ≥ 2. A continuación, mostramos que es imposible implementar la función de resultado de VCG, incluso por un mediador no índice, en una subasta de posición de autopricio que tiene más de una posición (m> 1). Teorema 6. Deje que G sea una subasta de posición de auto-precio con más de una posición. No existe un mediador que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en G. Prueba. Sea v ∈ V el siguiente perfil de valoración.vn = 10 y v1 = v2 = · · · = vn - 1 = 5. La función de resultado VCG asigna a esta v una asignación, en la que el jugador N recibe la posición 1 y el jugador 1 recibe la posición 2. Los pagos de los jugadores n y 1 son iguales a 5. Para implementar dicho resultado, un mediador debe ofertar 5 en nombre del jugador N (para que este jugador pague 5), y debe ofertar menos de 5 en nombre de cualquier otro jugador, porque de lo contrario otro jugador recibe la posición 1. Tenga en cuenta que la oferta de cualquier otro jugador no puede igualar 5 porque cualquier otro jugador tiene una prioridad más alta que n.En particular, incluso si el jugador 1 obtiene la posición 2, pagará menos de 5. Por lo tanto, ningún mediador puede implementar la función de resultado de VCG en G.2 La prueba del teorema 6 utiliza en gran medida el supuesto de regla de prioridad fija. Sin embargo, como ya hemos dicho, todos nuestros resultados, incluido este teorema, también se mantienen para la regla de ruptura de la corbata definida por la regla de prioridad aleatoria. La prueba del teorema de imposibilidad para la regla de prioridad aleatoria utiliza el hecho de que la regla de prioridad mala particular utilizada en la prueba del teorema 6 tiene una probabilidad positiva. Como discutimos anteriormente, las reglas de prioridad fija y aleatoria son formas convenientes de modelar la regla de primera llegada, que es común en la práctica. Cuando uno intenta modelar directamente las subastas de posición que usan la regla de primera llegada sin estas opciones de modelado, aborda muchos problemas de modelado. En particular, no está claro cómo modelar una subasta de posición con la regla de primera llegada como un juego con información incompleta. Para hacer esto, uno tiene que permitir que un jugador no solo envíe una oferta, sino que también decida sobre el momento de la oferta. Esto plantea muchos problemas de modelado adicionales, como determinar la relación entre el momento en que un jugador decide enviar una oferta y el momento en que realmente se registra esta oferta. Por lo tanto, el modelado eficiente como juego puede ser inaccesible. Sin embargo, en la siguiente sección analizaremos mediadores en las subastas de posición, que usan la regla de primera llegada. Definiremos EX Post Equilibrio y la noción de implementación por mediación sin modelar explícitamente juegos bien definidos. Mostraremos que en este caso 285 hay una manera de implementar la función de resultado de VCG en una subasta de posición de auto-precio. Además, encontraremos un mediador válido que haga el trabajo.7. Subastas de posición con la primera regla de llegada Sea G una subasta de posición con la regla de primera llegada. Cada mediador para G tiene la capacidad de determinar el orden en que se registran las ofertas que presenta en nombre de los jugadores;Él puede presentar las ofertas secuencialmente, esperando una confirmación antes de presentar la próxima oferta. Necesitamos las siguientes anotaciones. Cada orden de licitación puede ser descrito por algunos γ ∈ γ;Ofrezco antes de k si y solo si γi <γk. Por lo tanto, una orden de ofertas puede servir como una regla prioritaria. Para cada orden de ofertas γ y un vector de ofertas b, definimos S (b, γ, i) como la posición asignada a i. Denotamos el pago de I cuando el vector de ofertas es B y el orden de licitación es γ por qi (b, γ) = ps (b, γ, i) (b), y denotamos wi (vi, b, γ) la utilidad de i. Un mediador de G debe determinar las ofertas de los jugadores que usan sus servicios y también el orden de las ofertas en función de los tipos informados. Sin embargo, todos los mediadores discutidos en este documento utilizarán la misma regla para determinar el orden de las ofertas: si todos los jugadores informan el vector de los tipos ˆv, el mediador usa el orden de las ofertas γˆv, que se define como sigue: γˆv i <γˆv ksi y solo si ˆvi> ˆvk, o ˆvi = ˆvk e i <k.Por ejemplo, si n = 3 y los tipos informados son ˆV = (6, 7, 6), entonces γˆv = (2, 1, 3). Si solo un subconjunto estricto de los jugadores usa los servicios de mediadores, el mediador aplica la misma regla de orden de ofertas a este subconjunto. Por lo tanto, un mediador para una subasta de posición con la primera regla de llegada está definido por un vector m = (ms) s⊆n. Sin embargo, dicho mediador se llama mediador dirigido para enfatizar el hecho de que determina no solo las ofertas sino también el orden de las ofertas. Para resumir: si todos los jugadores usan el mediador dirigido M, y las ofertas informadas son ˆV, entonces el mediador dirigido BIDs Mn (ˆv) I En nombre de I, recibo la posición S (ˆv, γˆv, I), y paga Qi(Mn (ˆv), γˆv). Si solo el subconjunto s usa los servicios de mediadores, los tipos informados son ˆV, y los otros jugadores ofrecen directamente b - s, entonces el orden real de las ofertas no se determina de manera única. Si este orden es γ, entonces la posición de I ∈ N es S (B, γ, I), y su pago es Qi (B, γ), donde B = (MS (ˆVS), B - S). En particular, si cada jugador está utilizando la estrategia T y el perfil de los jugadores de los tipos es V, entonces el resultado generado por el mediador dirigido es ψm (v) = (S (V, γv), Q (Mn (V),γv). Pero, ¿por qué los jugadores deberían usar la estrategia T? Suponga a todos los jugadores, pero uso la estrategia T. Si el jugador me desvía de la estrategia T al informar un tipo falso al mediador dirigido, el resultado resultante está bien definido. Por otro lado, cuando este jugador envía una oferta directamente al subastador, el resultado resultante no está claro, porque el orden de las ofertas no está claro.11 Un buen mediador dirigido deseado sería uno que ningún jugador querría desviar de laT estrategia independientemente del orden en que se registran las ofertas debido a su desviación. Más específicamente: Definición: Sea G una subasta de posición con la regla de la primera barra de madera, y sea un mediador dirigido para G. Sin embargo, el 11 está claro que el orden resultante γ es consistente con el orden bien definido de ofertas de n\\ i.El perfil T-Strategy es un equilibrio ex post con respecto a M si para cada jugador I y Tipo VI, y para cada vector de tipos de otros jugadores, v-I, las siguientes dos condiciones se mantienen: F1: No está mejorCuando le da al mediador dirigido el derecho de juego e informa un tipo falso. Es decir, por cada ˆVi ∈ Vi Wi (VI, Mn (VI, V - I), γ (VI, V - I)) ≥ Wi (VI, Mn (ˆVi, V - I), γ (ˆVi, V−i) ). F2: No está mejor cuando él oferta directamente independientemente del orden resultante de las ofertas registradas. Eso es para cada bi ∈ Bi, y para cada γ ∈ γ, que es consistente con el orden de las ofertas de los miembros de N \\ I resultante del vector de los tipos V - I, WI (VI, Mn (VI, V, I), γ (vi, v - i)) ≥ wi (vi, (bi, mn \\ i (v - i)), γ). La noción de mediadores dirigidos válidos se define análoga: Definición: Sea G una subasta de posición con la regla de Firstarrival. Un mediador dirigido para G es válido, si para cada jugador, el uso de la estrategia T garantiza un nivel de utilidad no negativo. Formalmente, un mediador dirigido M para G es válido, si para cada jugador I con tipo VI, para cada subconjunto S ⊆ n de tal manera que yo ∈ S, para cada VS \\ I, y por cada B - S, Wi (VI, MS(vs), B - S, γ) ≥ 0 por cada γ ∈ γ, lo que es consistente con el orden estándar de BID de S determinados por el mediador cuando los tipos informados son vs. La noción de implementación por mediación permanece como antes: el mediador dirigido M implementa la función de resultado de VCG en g si ψm = ϕvcg. Nuestros resultados anteriores siguen siendo ciertos para los mediadores dirigidos para las subastas de posición con la primera regla de llegada. A continuación, mostramos que, en contraste con el Teorema 6, es posible implementar la función de resultado de VCG en cada subasta de posición de auto-precio con la regla de primera llegada. Teorema 7. Sea G = G (α, P) la subasta de posición de auto-precio con la primera regla de llegada. Existe un mediador dirigido válido que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en G. En el siguiente teorema proporcionamos condiciones suficientes para implementar que la función de resultado de VCG en una subasta de posición con la primera regla de llegada. Una característica especial de las subastas que satisfacen estas condiciones suficientes es que los pagos de los jugadores pueden depender también de su propia oferta, en contraste con las subastas discutidas en el Teorema 3. La larga prueba de este teorema está en el espíritu de todas las pruebas anteriores y, por lo tanto, se omite. Teorema 8. Sea G = G (α, P) una subasta de posición con la regla de primera llegada. Si se mantienen las siguientes condiciones, entonces existe un mediador dirigido válido para G que implementa la función de resultado de VCG en G. 1. Para cada v ∈ V existe b ∈ B tal que pj (b) = v (j) para cada j ∈ K. 2. G es monótono.3. Pj (b) ≥ PJ+1 (b) para cada j ∈ K y cada b ∈ B. 4. Para cada j ∈ K y cada b1, b2 ∈ B tal que b1 (l) = b2 (l) por cada l ≥ j, pj (b1) = pj (b2).286 8. Referencias [1] R.J.Aumann. Subjetividad y correlación en estrategias aleatorias.

        "It is useful to define for every position auction two dummy positions m + 1 and −1, which more than one player may be assigned to.",
        "All players, who participate in the auction but do not get a position in K are assigned to position m + 1 and all players who choose not to participate are assigned to position −1.",
        "We also define αm+1 = α−1 = 0.",
        "An assignment of players to positions is called an allocation.",
        "Hence, an allocation is a vector s = (s1, s2, · · · , sn) with si ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} such that if si ∈ K then si = sl for every l = i; si is the position of player i.",
        "Given the above, a position auction is defined by its tie breaking rule, which determines the allocation in case of ties, and by its payment scheme.",
        "These are discussed below. 2.1 Tie breaking rules In practice, the most commonly used tie breaking rule is the First-Arrival rule: if a set of players submit the same bid, their priority in receiving the positions is determined by the times their bids were recorded; An earlier bid receives a higher priority.",
        "In auction theory this tie breaking rule is typically modelled by assuming that the auctioneer is using a random priority rule.",
        "More specifically, let Γ be the set of all permutations, γ = (γ1, ..., γn) of N. Every such γ defines a priority rule as follows: i has a higher priority than k if and only if γi < γk.",
        "Every vector of bids b and a permutation γ uniquely determine an allocation.",
        "An auctioneer who is using the random priority rule chooses a fixed priority rule γ by randomizing uniformly over Γ.",
        "However, the resulting priority rule is not told to the players before they make their bids.",
        "When the priority rule γ is told to the players before they make their bids, the tie breaking rule is called a fixed priority rule.",
        "Dealing with a fixed priority rule simplifies notations and proofs, and in most cases, and in particular in this paper, results that are obtained with this tie breaking rule are identical to the results obtained with the random priority rule.",
        "Therefore we will assume this tie breaking rule.",
        "In contrast, in Section 7 we discuss a non-standard approach for analyzing directly the first-arrival tie breaking rule.",
        "Unless we say specifically otherwise we assume in this paper a fixed priority rule.",
        "Without loss of generality we assume that the fixed priority rule is defined by the natural order, ˜γ = (1, 2, ..., n).",
        "That is, bidder i has a higher priority than bidder k if and only if i < k. Given this fixed priority rule we can make the following definitions, which apply to all position auctions: We denote by s(b, i) the position player i is assigned to when the bid profile is b.",
        "The allocation determined by b is denoted by s(b) = (s(b, 1), s(b, 2), · · · , s(b, n)).",
        "For every j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} we denote by δ(b, j) the set of players assigned to position j.",
        "Note that for j ∈ K, δ(b, j) contains at most one player. 2.2 The payment schemes Let α be a click-trough rate vector.",
        "Each position j ∈ K ∪ {−1, m + 1} is associated with a payment function, pα j : B → R+, where pα j (b) is the payment for position j when the bid profile is b.",
        "Naturally we assume that pα −1 is identically zero.",
        "However, we also assume that pα m+1 is identically zero.",
        "Hence, a participant who is not assigned a real position pays nothing.",
        "We call the vector of payment functions pα = (pα j )j∈K the position payment scheme.",
        "Remark: Whenever α is fixed or its value is clear from the context we will allow ourselves to omit the superscript α from the payment and other functions.",
        "We deal with anonymous position payment schemes, i.e. the players payments to the auctioneer are not influenced by their identities.",
        "This is modeled as follows: Let b ∈ B = B1 × B2 × · · · × Bn be a bid profile.",
        "We denote by b(j) the jth highest bid in b.",
        "For j > n we let b(j) = 0.",

        "Anonymity is modeled by the requirement that for every two bid profiles b, d ∈ B, p(b) = p(d) whenever b∗ = d∗ .",
        "That is, for every position j there exists a real-valued function ˜pj defined over all ordered vectors of bids such that for every b ∈ B pj(b) = ˜pj(b∗ ).",
        "We further assume that a player never pays more than his bid.",
        "That is pj(b) ≤ b(j) for every b ∈ B and for every j ∈ K. It is convenient in certain cases to describe the payment functions indexed by the players.",

        "Self-price position auctions: Each player who is assigned to a position with a positive click-through rate pays his own bid.",

        "That is for every j ∈ K and for every b ∈ B pj(b) = b(j+1) (2) VCG position auctions: In a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) position auction the payment function for position j ∈ K is defined as follows.6 For every b ∈ B pvcg j (b) = Pm+1 k=j+1 b(k)(αk−1 − αk) αj (3) Note that the VCG position auction is not the next-price position auction unless there is only one position and α1 = 1. 2.4 Mediators for position auctions We denote by G = G(α, p) the position auction with the click-through rate vector α and the payment scheme p. Recall that the set of types of i is Vi = (0, ∞).",
        "Let V = V1 × V2 × · · · × Vn be the set of profile of types, and for every S ⊆ N let VS = ×i∈SVi.",
        "A mediator for G is a vector of functions m = (mS)S⊆N , where mS : VS → BS.",
        "The mediator m generates a preBayesian game Gm, which is called the mediated game.",
        "In this game every player i receives his type vi and can either send a type, ˆvi (not necessarily the true type) to the mediator, or send a bid directly to the auction.",
        "If S is the set of players that send a type to the mediator, the mediator bids on their behalf mS(ˆvS).",
        "Hence, the action set of player i in the mediated game is Bi ∪Vi, where conveniently Vi denotes both, (0, ∞) , and a copy of (0, ∞), which is disjoint from 6 We use the standard payment function of the VCG mechanism.",
        "A general VCG mechanism may be obtained from the standard one by adding an additional payment function to each player, which depends only on the types of the other players.",
        "Some authors (see e.g., [7]) call the standard VCG mechanism, the VC mechanism.",
        "According to this terminology we actually deal with VC position auctions.",
        "However, we decided to use the more common terminology.",
        "Bi.",
        "We introduce the following terminology: The T-strategy for a player in the mediated game is the strategy, in which this player uses the mediators services and reports his true value to the mediator.",
        "The T-strategy profile is the profile of strategies in which every player is using the T-strategy.",
        "The T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in the mediated game if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: E1: i is not better off when he gives the mediator the right of play and report a false type.",

        "Whenever the T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, the mediator m implements an outcome function in G. This outcome function is denoted by ϕm , and it is defined as follows: ϕm (v) = (s(mN (v)), q(mN (v)).",
        "Hence, the range of the function ϕm is the Cartesian product of the set of allocations with Rn +. 3.",
        "IMPLEMENTING THE VCG OUTCOME FUNCTION BY MEDIATION In general, except for the VCG position auction we do not expect position auctions to possess an ex post equilibrium.7 Therefore, the behavior of the participants in most position auctions cannot be analytically predicted, and in practice it can form a non-efficient allocation: an allocation that does not maximize social surplus.",
        "In contrast, in the VCG position auction the truth-reporting strategy is a dominant strategy for every player, and the resulting allocation is efficient.",
        "Given a position auction G our goal is to construct a mediator that would implement the outcome function of the VCG position auction.",

        "Definition: Let G be a position auction .",
        "Let m be a mediator for G. We say the m implements the VCG outcome function in G, or that it implements ϕvcg in G if the Tstrategy profile is an ex post equilibrium in Gm, and ϕm = ϕvcg .",
        "We demonstrate our definitions so far by a simple example: Example 1.",
        "Consider a self-price auction G = G(α, p) with 2 players and one position, with α1 = 1.",

        "It is commonly conjectured that except for some extremely artificial combinatorial auctions , the VCG combinatorial auctions are the only ones with dominant strategies (see [10]). 282 players use the mediators services and send him the types ˆv = (ˆv1, ˆv2), then all mediators act similarly and as follows: If ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 the mediator makes the following bids on behalf of the players: b1 = ˆv2, and b2 = 0.",

        "If he reports ˆv1 < v2 his utility will be 0.",
        "If player 1 does not use the mediator, he should bid at least cv2 in order to get the positions, and therefore his utility cannot exceed v1 − v2.",
        "If v1 < v2, then the T-strategy yields 0 to player 1, and any other strategy yields a non-positive utility.",
        "Obviously each of the mediators mc implements the VCG outcome function.",
        "Note however, that the T-strategy is not a dominant strategy when c > 1; e.g. if v1 > v2 and player 2 bids directly v2 (without using the mediator services), then bidding directly v1 is better for player 1 than using the Tstrategy: in the former case player 1s utility is 0 and in the latter case her utility is negative.",
        "It is interesting to note that this simple example can not be extended to general self-price position auctions, as will be discussed in section 4.",
        "While each of the mediators mc in Example 1 implements the VCG outcome function, the mediator with c = 1 has a distinct characteristic: a player who uses the T-strategy cannot get a negative utility.",
        "In contrast, for every c > 1, if say player 2 does not use the mediator services, participates directly and bids less than cv1, then the T-strategy yields a negative utility of (1 − c)v1 to player 1.",

        "Let ˜δ(b, j) be defined as follows.",
        "For every j ∈ K, let ˜δ(b, j) be the player i that obtains position j, and for j = m let ˜δ(b, j) = i, where i obtained position m in case there is more than one player i such that bi = b(m), then i is chosen between them via the breaking rule ˜γ.",
        "If player i obtains position j ∈ K then she pays pj(b) = β˜δ(b,j+1) b˜δ(b,j+1) βi .",
        "Therefore player is utility will be αjβi(vi − b˜δ(b,j+1) βi β˜δ(b,j+1)) = αj(viβi − b˜δ(b,j+1)β˜δ(b,j+1)). 9 Recall that b(j) = 0 for every j > n 10 See e.g. [17].",

        "The payments of players n and 1 are both equal to 5.",
        "In order to implement such an outcome, a mediator must bid 5 on behalf of player n (so that this player pays 5), and it must bid less than 5 on behalf of any other player, because otherwise another player receives position 1.",
        "Note that the bid of any other player cannot equal 5 because every other player has an higher priority than n. In particular, even if player 1 gets indeed position 2 he will pay less than 5.",
        "Hence, no mediator can implement the VCG outcome function in G.2 The proof of Theorem 6 heavily uses the fixed priority rule assumption.",
        "However, as we have already said, all our results including this theorem hold also for the tie breaking rule defined by the random priority rule.",
        "The proof of the impossibility theorem for the random priority rule uses the fact that the particular bad priority rule used in the proof of Theorem 6, has a positive probability.",

        "When one attempts to directly model position auctions that use the first-arrival rule without these modeling choices he tackles a lot of modeling problems.",
        "In particular, it is not clear how to model a position auction with the first-arrival rule as a game with incomplete information.",
        "To do this, one has to allow a player not only to submit a bid but also to decide about the time of the bid.",
        "This raises a lot of additional modeling problems, such as determining the relationship between the time a player decides to submit a bid and the time in which this bid is actually recorded.",
        "Hence, efficient modeling as a game may be untractable.",
        "Nevertheless, in the next section we will analyze mediators in position auctions, which use the first-arrival rule.",
        "We will define ex post equilibrium and the notion of implementation by mediation without explicitly modeling well-defined games.",
        "We will show that in this case 285 there is a way to implement the VCG outcome function in a self-price position auction.",

        "POSITION AUCTIONS WITH THE FIRST ARRIVAL RULE Let G be a position auction with the first-arrival rule.",
        "Every mediator for G has the ability to determine the order in which the bids he submits on behalf of the players are recorded; He can just submit the bids sequentially, waiting for a confirmation before submitting the next bid.",
        "We need the following notations.",
        "Every order of bidding can be described by some γ ∈ Γ; i bids before k if and only if γi < γk.",
        "Hence, an order of bids can serve as a priority rule.",
        "For every order of bids γ and a vector of bids b we define s(b, γ, i) as the position assigned to i.",
        "We denote the payment of i when the vector of bids is b and the order of bidding is γ by qi(b, γ) = ps(b,γ,i)(b), and we denote wi(vi, b, γ) the utility of i.",
        "A mediator for G should determine the bids of the players who use its services and also the order of bids as a function of the reported types.",
        "However, all mediators discussed in this paper will use the same rule to determine the order of bids: If all players report the vector of types ˆv, the mediator uses the order of bids γˆv , which is defined as follows: γˆv i < γˆv k if and only if ˆvi > ˆvk, or ˆvi = ˆvk and i < k. For example, if n = 3 and the reported types are ˆv = (6, 7, 6), then γˆv = (2, 1, 3).",
        "If only a strict subset of the players use the mediators services, the mediator applies the same order of bids rule to this subset.",
        "A mediator for a position auction with the first arrival rule is therefore defined by a vector m = (mS)S⊆N .",
        "However, such a mediator is called a directed mediator in order to stress the fact that it determines not only the bids but also the order of bids.",
        "To summarize: If all players use the directed mediator m, and the reported bids are ˆv, then the directed mediator bids mN (ˆv)i on behalf of i, i receives the position s(ˆv, γˆv , i), and pays qi(mN (ˆv), γˆv ).",
        "If only the subset S uses the mediators services, the reported types are ˆvS, and the other players bid directly b−S then the actual order of bids is not uniquely determined.",
        "If this order is γ then the position of i ∈ N is s(b, γ, i), and its payment is qi(b, γ), where b = (mS(ˆvS), b−S).",
        "In particular, if every player is using the T-strategy and the players profile of types is v, then the outcome generated by the directed mediator is ψm (v) = (s(v, γv ), q(mN (v), γv ).",
        "But why should the players use the T strategy?",
        "Assume all players but i use the T strategy.",
        "If player i deviates from the T strategy by reporting a false type to the directed mediator, the resulting outcome is well-defined.",
        "On the other hand, when this player sends a bid directly to the auctioneer, the resulting outcome is not clear, because the order of bids is not clear.11 A good desired directed mediator would be one that no player would want to deviate from the T strategy independently of the order in which the bids are recorded because of his deviation.",
        "More specifically: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the firstarrival rule, and let m be a directed mediator for G. The 11 It is clear however, that the resulting order γ is consistent with the well-defined order of bids of N \\ i. T-strategy profile is an ex post equilibrium with respect to m if for every player i and type vi, and for every vector of types of the other players, v−i, the following two conditions hold: F1: i is not better off when he gives the directed mediator the right of play and reports a false type.",
        "That is, for every ˆvi ∈ Vi wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, mN (ˆvi, v−i), γ(ˆvi,v−i) ).",
        "F2: i is not better off when he bids directly independently of the resulting order of recorded bids.",
        "That is for every bi ∈ Bi, and for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the order of bids of members of N \\ i resulting from the vector of types v−i, wi(vi, mN (vi, v−i), γ(vi,v−i) ) ≥ wi(vi, (bi, mN\\i(v−i)), γ).",
        "The notion of valid directed mediators is analogously defined: Definition: Let G be a position auction with the firstarrival rule.",
        "A directed mediator for G is valid, if for every player, using the T-strategy guarantees a non-negative level of utility.",
        "Formally, a directed mediator m for G is valid, if for every player i with type vi, for every subset S ⊆ N such that i ∈ S, for every vS\\i, and for every b−S, wi(vi, mS(vS), b−S, γ) ≥ 0 for every γ ∈ Γ, which is consistent with the standard order of bids of S determined by the mediator when the reported types are vS.",
        "The notion of implementation by mediation remains as before: The directed mediator m implements the VCG outcome function in G if ψm = ϕvcg .",
        "Our previous results remain true for directed mediators for position auctions with the first arrival rule.",
        "Next we show that in contrast to Theorem 6, it is possible to implement the VCG outcome function in every self-price position auction with the first-arrival rule.",

For example, if n = 3 and the reported types are ˆv = (6, 7, 6), then γˆv = (2, 1, 3).",
