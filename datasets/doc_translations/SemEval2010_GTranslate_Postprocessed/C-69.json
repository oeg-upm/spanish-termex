We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display. We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and evaluated its performance on mobile wireless devices.

INTRODUCTION The increasing ubiquity of wireless networks and decreasing cost of hardware is fueling a proliferation of mobile wireless handheld devices, both as standalone wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) and popular integrated PDA/cell phone devices. These devices are enabling new forms of mobile computing and communication. Service providers are leveraging these devices to deliver pervasive web access, and mobile web users already often use these devices to access web-enabled information such as news, email, and localized travel guides and maps. It is likely that within a few years, most of the devices accessing the web will be mobile. Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA. Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10]. As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience. This fundamental problem arises for two reasons. First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs. Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts. Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life. Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA. Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality. Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices. A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol. The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server. Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client. Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications. The thin-client model provides several important benefits for mobile wireless web. First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments. Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10]. Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance. Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life. Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen. This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations. Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices. Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content. Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions. While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content. To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices. For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications. Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability. We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software. We have quantitatively evaluated pTHINC against local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches on Pocket PC devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback. This paper presents the design and implementation of pTHINC. Section 2 describes the overall usage model and usability characteristics of pTHINC. Section 3 presents the design and system architecture of pTHINC. Section 4 presents experimental results measuring the performance of pTHINC on web applications and comparing it against native PDA browsers and other popular PDA thin-client systems. Section 5 discusses related work. Finally, we present some concluding remarks. 2. PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC. The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic. The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications. Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user. When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking. Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session. If the session does not exist, a new session is created. Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration. Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime. When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected. The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated. This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices. If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session. Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well. A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers. Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner. The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user. Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer. As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines. To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions. Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used. For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display. Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages. For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view. To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations. In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height. However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious. Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page. To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode. The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices. Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session. To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user. The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed. Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience. These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users. This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard. The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one. Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus. A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event. A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click. All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment. In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest. Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment. This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices. Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3. PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer. This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients. For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system. Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task. Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance. On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance. The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client. In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates. By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands. In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment. The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows. COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location. This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server. SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen. They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs. SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color. PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region. BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color. Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen. This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client. Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system. Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates. This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser. In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler. SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system. In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user. On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page. Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client. The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates. This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages. First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display. Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work. Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements. To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive. Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes. When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right. When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom. These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA. Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client. Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase. Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface. Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video. To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback. On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits. First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically. As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits. Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color. In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel. Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent. Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA. A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator. In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format. When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing. As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling. By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected. In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems. To demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting mobile wireless web applications, we have measured its performance on web applications. We present experimental results on different PDA devices for two popular web applications, browsing web pages and playing video content from the web. We compared pTHINC against native web applications running locally on the PDA to demonstrate the improvement that pTHINC can provide over the traditional fat-client approach. We also compared pTHINC against three of the most widely used thin clients that can run on PDAs, Citrix Meta-FrameXP [2], Microsoft Remote Desktop [3] and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) [16]. We follow common practice and refer to Citrix MetaFrameXP and Microsoft Remote Desktop by their respective remote display protocols, ICA (Independent Computing Architecture) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). 4.1 Experimental Testbed We conducted our web experiments using two different wireless Pocket PC PDAs in an isolated Wi-Fi network testbed, as shown in Figure 2. The testbed consisted of two PDA client devices, a packet monitor, a thin-client server, and a web server. Except for the PDAs, all of the other machines were IBM Netfinity 4500R servers with dual 933 MHz Intel PIII CPUs and 512 MB RAM and were connected on a switched 100 Mbps FastEthernet network. The web server used was Apache 1.3.27, the network emulator was NISTNet 2.0.12, and the packet monitor was Ethereal 0.10.9. The PDA clients connected to the testbed through a 802.11b Lucent Orinoco AP-2000 wireless access point. All experiments using the wireless network were conducted within ten feet of the access point, so we considered the amount of packet loss to be negligible in our experiments. Two Pocket PC PDAs were used to provide results across both older, less powerful models and newer higher performance models. The older model was a Dell Axim X5 with 147 Client 1024×768 640×480 Depth Resize Clip RDP no yes 8-bit no yes VNC yes yes 16-bit no no ICA yes yes 16-bit yes no pTHINC yes yes 24-bit yes no Table 2: Thin-client Testbed Configuration Setting a 400 MHz Intel XScale PXA255 CPU and 64 MB RAM running Windows Mobile 2003 and a Dell TrueMobile 1180 2.4Ghz CompactFlash card for wireless networking. The newer model was a Dell Axim X51v with a 624 MHz Intel XScale XPA270 CPU and 64 MB RAM running Windows Mobile 5.0 and integrated 802.11b wireless networking. The X51v has an Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator with 16MB video memory. Both PDAs are capable of 16-bit color but have different screen sizes and display resolutions. The X5 has a 3.5 inch diagonal screen with 240×320 resolution. The X51v has a 3.7 inch diagonal screen with 480×640. The four thin clients that we used support different levels of display quality as summarized in Table 2. The RDP client only supports a fixed 640×480 display resolution on the server with 8-bit color depth, while other platforms provide higher levels of display quality. To provide a fair comparison across all platforms, we conducted our experiments with thin-client sessions configured for two possible resolutions, 1024×768 and 640×480. Both ICA and VNC were configured to use the native PDA resolution of 16-bit color depth. The current pTHINC prototype uses 24-bit color directly and the client downsamples updates to the 16-bit color depth available on the PDA. RDP was configured using only 8-bit color depth since it does not support any better color depth. Since both pTHINC and ICA provide the ability to view the display resized to fit the screen, we measured both clients with and without the display resized to fit the PDA screen. Each thin client was tested using landscape rather than portrait mode when available. All systems run on the X51v could run in landscape mode because the hardware provides a landscape mode feature. However, the X5 does not provide this functionality. Only pTHINC directly supports landscape mode, so it was the only system that could run in landscape mode on both the X5 and X51v. To provide a fair comparison, we also standardized on common hardware and operating systems whenever possible. All of the systems used the Netfinity server as the thin-client server. For the two systems designed for Windows servers, ICA and RDP, we ran Windows 2003 Server on the server. For the other systems which support X-based servers, VNC and pTHINC, we ran the Debian Linux Unstable distribution with the Linux 2.6.10 kernel on the server. We used the latest thin-client server versions available on each platform at the time of our experiments, namely Citrix MetaFrame XP Server for Windows Feature Release 3, Microsoft Remote Desktop built into Windows XP and Windows 2003 using RDP 5.2, and VNC 4.0. 4.2 Application Benchmarks We used two web application benchmarks for our experiments based on two common application scenarios, browsing web pages and playing video content from the web. Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10]. This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs. To measure web browsing performance, we used a web browsing benchmark based on the Web Text Page Load Test from the Ziff-Davis i-Bench benchmark suite [7]. The benchmark consists of JavaScript controlled load of 55 pages from the web server. The pages contain both text and graphics with pages varying in size. The graphics are embedded images in GIF and JPEG formats. The original i-Bench benchmark was modified for slow-motion benchmarking by introducing delays of several seconds between the pages using JavaScript. Then two tests were run, one where delays where added between each page, and one where pages where loaded continuously without waiting for them to be displayed on the client. In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages. We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10]. The packet monitor also recorded the amount of data transmitted between the client and the server. The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor. This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough. The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time. To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 running on the thin-client server for the thin clients, and Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile for 2003 and Mobile for 5.0 for the native browsers on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively. In all cases, the web browser used was sized to fill the entire display region available. To measure video playback performance, we used a video benchmark that consisted of playing a 34.75s MPEG-1 video clip containing a mix of news and entertainment programming at full-screen resolution. The video clip is 5.11 MB and consists of 834 352x240 pixel frames with an ideal frame rate of 24 frames/sec. We measured video performance using slow-motion benchmarking by monitoring resulting packet traffic at two playback rates, 1 frames/second (fps) and 24 fps, and comparing the results to determine playback delays and frame drops that occur at 24 fps to measure overall video quality [13]. For example, 100% quality means that all video frames were played at real-time speed. On the other hand, 50% quality could mean that half the video data was dropped, or that the clip took twice as long to play even though all of the video data was displayed. To run the video benchmark, we used Windows Media Player 9 for Windows-based thin-client servers, MPlayer 1.0 pre 6 for X-based thin-client servers, and Windows Media Player 9 Mobile and 10 Mobile for the native video players running locally on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively. In all cases, the video player used was sized to fill the entire display region available. 4.3 Measurements Figures 3 and 4 show the results of running the web brows148 0 1 10 100 pTHINC Resized pTHINCICA Resized ICAVNCRDPLOCAL Latency(s) Platform Axim X5 (640x480 or less) Axim X51v (640x480) Axim X5 (1024x768) Axim X51v (1024x768) Figure 3: Browsing Benchmark: Average Page Latency ing benchmark. For each platform, we show results for up to four different configurations, two on the X5 and two on the X51v, depending on whether each configuration was supported. However, not all platforms could support all configurations. The local browser only runs at the display resolution of the PDA, 480×680 or less for the X51v and the X5. RDP only runs at 640×480. Neither platform could support 1024×768 display resolution. ICA only ran on the X5 and could not run on the X51v because it did not work on Windows Mobile 5. Figure 3 shows the average latency per web page for each platform. pTHINC provides the lowest average web browsing latency on both PDAs. On the X5, pTHINC performs up to 70 times better than other thin-client systems and 8 times better than the local browser. On the X51v, pTHINC performs up to 80 times better than other thin-client systems and 7 times better than the native browser. In fact, all of the thin clients except VNC outperform the local PDA browser, demonstrating the performance benefits of the thin-client approach. Usability studies have shown that web pages should take less than one second to download for the user to experience an uninterrupted web browsing experience [14]. The measurements show that only the thin clients deliver subsecond web page latencies. In contrast, the local browser requires more than 3 seconds on average per web page. The local browser performs worse since it needs to run a more limited web browser to process the HTML, JavaScript, and do all the rendering using the limited capabilities of the PDA. The thin clients can take advantage of faster server hardware and a highly tuned web browser to process the web content much faster. Figure 3 shows that RDP is the next fastest platform after pTHINC. However, RDP is only able to run at a fixed resolution of 640×480 and 8-bit color depth. Furthermore, RDP also clips the display to the size of the PDA screen so that it does not need to send updates that are not visible on the PDA screen. This provides a performance benefit assuming the remaining web content is not viewed, but degrades performance when a user scrolls around the display to view other web content. RDP achieves its performance with significantly lower display quality compared to the other thin clients and with additional display clipping not used by other systems. As a result, RDP performance alone does not provide a complete comparison with the other platforms. In contrast, pTHINC provides the fastest performance while at the same time providing equal or better display quality than the other systems. 0 1 10 100 1000 pTHINC Resized pTHINCICA Resized ICAVNCRDPLOCAL DataSize(KB) Platform Axim X5 (640x480 or less) Axim X51v (640x480) Axim X5 (1024x768) Axim X51v (1024x768) Figure 4: Browsing Benchmark: Average Page Data Transferred Since VNC and ICA provide similar display quality to pTHINC, these systems provide a more fair comparison of different thin-client approaches. ICA performs worse in part because it uses higher-level display primitives that require additional client processing costs. VNC performs worse in part because it loses display data due to its client-pull delivery mechanism and because of the client processing costs in decompressing raw pixel primitives. In both cases, their performance was limited in part because their PDA clients were unable to keep up with the rate at which web pages were being displayed. Figure 3 also shows measurements for those thin clients that support resizing the display to fit the PDA screen, namely ICA and pTHINC. Resizing requires additional processing, which results in slower average web page latencies. The measurements show that the additional delay incurred by ICA when resizing versus not resizing is much more substantial than for pTHINC. ICA performs resizing on the slower PDA client. In contrast, pTHINC leverage the more powerful server to do resizing, reducing the performance difference between resizing and not resizing. Unlike ICA, pTHINC is able to provide subsecond web page download latencies in both cases. Figure 4 shows the data transferred in KB per page when running the slow-motion version of the tests. All of the platforms have modest data transfer requirements of roughly 100 KB per page or less. This is well within the bandwidth capacity of Wi-Fi networks. The measurements show that the local browser does not transfer the least amount of data. This is surprising as HTML is often considered to be a very compact representation of content. Instead, RDP is the most bandwidth efficient platform, largely as a result of using only 8-bit color depth and screen clipping so that it does not transfer the entire web page to the client. pTHINC overall has the largest data requirements, slightly more than VNC. This is largely a result of the current pTHINC prototypes lack of native support for 16-bit color data in the wire protocol. However, this result also highlights pTHINCs performance as it is faster than all other systems even while transferring more data. Furthermore, as newer PDA models support full 24-bit color, these results indicate that pTHINC will continue to provide good web browsing performance. Since display usability and quality are as important as performance, Figures 5 to 8 compare screenshots of the different thin clients when displaying a web page, in this case from the popular BBC news website. Except for ICA, all of the screenshots were taken on the X51v in landscape mode 149 Figure 5: Browser Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 6: Browser Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 7: Browser Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 8: Browser Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 using the maximum display resolution settings for each platform given in Table 2. The ICA screenshot was taken on the X5 since ICA does not run on the X51v. While the screenshots lack the visual fidelity of the actual device display, several observations can be made. Figure 5 shows that RDP does not support fullscreen mode and wastes lots of screen space for controls and UI elements, requiring the user to scroll around in order to access the full contents of the web browsing session. Figure 6 shows that VNC makes better use of the screen space and provides better display quality, but still forces the user to scroll around to view the web page due to its lack of resizing support. Figure 7 shows ICAs ability to display the full web page given its resizing support, but that its lack of landscape capability and poorer resize algorithm significantly compromise display quality. In contrast, Figure 8 shows pTHINC using resizing to provide a high quality fullscreen display of the full width of the web page. pTHINC maximizes the entire viewing region by moving all controls to the PDA buttons. In addition, pTHINC leverages the server computational power to use a high quality resizing algorithm to resize the display to fit the PDA screen without significant overhead. Figures 9 and 10 show the results of running the video playback benchmark. For each platform except ICA, we show results for an X5 and X51v configuration. ICA could not run on the X51v as noted earlier. The measurements were done using settings that reflected the environment a user would have to access a web session from both a desktop computer and a PDA. As such, a 1024×768 server display resolution was used whenever possible and the video was shown at fullscreen. RDP was limited to 640×480 display resolution as noted earlier. Since viewing the entire video display is the only really usable option, we resized the display to fit the PDA screen for those platforms that supported this feature, namely ICA and pTHINC. Figure 9 shows the video quality for each platform. pTHINC is the only thin client able to provide perfect video playback quality, similar to the native PDA video player. All of the other thin clients deliver very poor video quality. With the exception of RDP on the X51v which provided unacceptable 35% video quality, none of the other systems were even able to achieve 10% video quality. VNC and ICA have the worst quality at 8% on the X5 device. pTHINCs native video support enables superior video performance, while other thin clients suffer from their inability to distinguish video from normal display updates. They attempt to apply ineffective and expensive compression algorithms on the video data and are unable to keep up with the stream of updates generated, resulting in dropped frames or long playback times. VNC suffers further from its client-pull update model because video frames are generated faster than the rate at which the client can process and send requests to the server to obtain the next display update. Figure 10 shows the total data transferred during 150 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% pTHINCICAVNCRDPLOCAL VideoQuality Platform Axim X5 Axim X51v Figure 9: Video Benchmark: Fullscreen Video Quality 0 1 10 100 pTHINCICAVNCRDPLOCAL VideoDataSize(MB) Platform Axim X5 Axim X51v Figure 10: Video Benchmark: Fullscreen Video Data video playback for each system. The native player is the most bandwidth efficient platform, sending less than 6 MB of data, which corresponds to about 1.2 Mbps of bandwidth. pTHINCs 100% video quality requires about 25 MB of data which corresponds to a bandwidth usage of less than 6 Mbps. While the other thin clients send less data than THINC, they do so because they are dropping video data, resulting in degraded video quality. Figures 11 to 14 compare screenshots of the different thin clients when displaying the video clip. Except for ICA, all of the screenshots were taken on the X51v in landscape mode using the maximum display resolution settings for each platform given in Table 2. The ICA screenshot was taken on the X5 since ICA does not run on the X51v. Figures 11 and 12 show that RDP and VNC are unable to display the entire video frame on the PDA screen. RDP wastes screen space for UI elements and VNC only shows the top corner of the video frame on the screen. Figure 13 shows that ICA provides resizing to display the entire video frame, but did not proportionally resize the video data, resulting in strange display artifacts. In contrast, Figure 14 shows pTHINC using resizing to provide a high quality fullscreen display of the entire video frame. pTHINC provides visually more appealing video display than RDP, VNC, or ICA. 5. RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10]. The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10]. This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality. The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems. Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video. Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18]. These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs. Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs. This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications. Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8]. They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy. Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications. With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices. Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser. Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6. CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices. We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications. Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser. In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.

Introducción La creciente ubicuidad de las redes inalámbricas y la disminución del costo del hardware están alimentando una proliferación de dispositivos de mano inalámbricos móviles, tanto como asistentes digitales personales inalámbricos independientes (PDA) y populares dispositivos PDA/teléfonos celulares integrados. Estos dispositivos están permitiendo nuevas formas de computación y comunicación móvil. Los proveedores de servicios están aprovechando estos dispositivos para entregar acceso web generalizado, y los usuarios web móviles ya usan estos dispositivos para acceder a información habilitada para la web, como noticias, correo electrónico y guías y mapas de viajes localizados. Es probable que en unos pocos años, la mayoría de los dispositivos que acceden a la web sean móviles. Los usuarios generalmente acceden al contenido web ejecutando un navegador web y aplicaciones auxiliar asociadas localmente en el PDA. Aunque los navegadores web nativos existen para PDA, ofrecen un rendimiento inferior y tienen un conjunto de características mucho más pequeño y una funcionalidad más limitada que sus contrapartes informáticas de escritorio [10]. Como resultado, los navegadores web PDA a menudo no pueden mostrar contenido web de sitios web que aprovechan las tecnologías web más avanzadas para ofrecer una experiencia web más rica. Este problema fundamental surge por dos razones. Primero, debido a que los PDA tienen un entorno de hardware/software completamente diferente de las computadoras de escritorio tradicionales, las aplicaciones web deben reescribirse y personalizarse para PDA, si es posible, duplicando los costos de desarrollo. Debido a que el mercado de aplicaciones de escritorio es más grande y más maduro, la mayor parte del esfuerzo de desarrollo generalmente termina gastando en aplicaciones de escritorio, lo que resulta en una mayor funcionalidad y rendimiento que sus contrapartes PDA. En segundo lugar, los PDA tienen un entorno más limitado de recursos que las computadoras de escritorio tradicionales para proporcionar un factor de forma más pequeño y una mayor duración de la batería. Los navegadores web de escritorio son aplicaciones grandes y complejas que no pueden ejecutarse en un PDA. En cambio, los desarrolladores se ven obligados a eliminar significativamente estos navegadores web para proporcionar un navegador web PDA utilizable, paralizando así la funcionalidad del navegador PDA. La informática del cliente delgado proporciona un enfoque alternativo para habilitar el acceso web generalizado desde los dispositivos portátiles. Un sistema informático de cliente delgado consiste en un servidor y un cliente que se comunica a través de una red utilizando un protocolo de pantalla remota. El protocolo permite que las pantallas gráficas se virtualicen y sirvan en una red a un dispositivo de cliente, mientras que la lógica de la aplicación se ejecuta en el servidor. Usando el protocolo de pantalla remota, el cliente transmite la entrada del usuario al servidor y el servidor devuelve las actualizaciones de la pantalla de las aplicaciones desde el servidor al cliente. Utilizando un modelo de cliente delgado para dispositivos de mano móviles, PDA puede convertirse en clientes simples sin estado que aprovechan las capacidades del servidor remoto para ejecutar navegadores web y otras aplicaciones auxiliares. El modelo de cliente delgado proporciona varios beneficios importantes para la web inalámbrica móvil. Primero, las aplicaciones web de escritorio estándar se pueden usar para entregar contenido web a PDA sin reescribir o adaptar aplicaciones para ejecutar un PDA, reduciendo los costos de desarrollo y aprovechando las inversiones de software existentes. En segundo lugar, las aplicaciones web complejas se pueden ejecutar en servidores potentes en lugar de ejecutar versiones despojadas en PDA más restringidas, proporcionando una mayor funcionalidad y un mejor rendimiento [10]. En tercer lugar, las aplicaciones web pueden aprovechar los servidores con redes más rápidas y una mejor conectividad, lo que aumenta el rendimiento de la aplicación. Cuarto, los PDA pueden ser dispositivos aún más simples, ya que no necesitan realizar una lógica de aplicación compleja, potencialmente reduciendo el consumo de energía y extender la duración de la batería. Finalmente, los clientes PDA delgados pueden ser esencialmente aparatos apátridos que no necesitan ser respaldados o restaurados, no requieren casi ningún mantenimiento ni actualizaciones, y no almacenan ningún datos confidenciales que se puedan perder o robar. Este modelo proporciona una vía viable para que las organizaciones médicas cumplan con las regulaciones de HIPAA [6] mientras adoptan las computadoras de mano móviles en sus operaciones diarias. A pesar de estas posibles ventajas, los clientes delgados no han podido proporcionar la gama completa de estos beneficios en la entrega de aplicaciones web a dispositivos de mano móviles. Los clientes delgados existentes no fueron diseñados para PDA y no tienen en cuenta los problemas importantes de usabilidad en el contexto de dispositivos de factor de forma pequeña, lo que resulta en dificultades para navegar por el contenido web. Además, los clientes delgados existentes son ineficaces para proporcionar una movilidad perfecta en la combinación heterogénea de tamaños y resoluciones de visualización de dispositivos. Si bien los clientes delgados existentes ya pueden proporcionar un rendimiento más rápido que los navegadores web nativos de PDA en la entrega de contenido web HTML, no admiten efectivamente aplicaciones de ayuda web de WebS BeTwelper más efectivamente, como Video Multimedia, que es cada vez más una parte integral del contenido web disponible. Para aprovechar todo el potencial de la informática del cliente delgado para proporcionar una red inalámbrica móvil en PDA, hemos desarrollado PTHINC (PDA Computación de Internet de Cliente delgado).Pthinc se basa en nuestro trabajo anterior sobre Thinc [1] para proporcionar una arquitectura de Client Tlin para dispositivos de mano móviles.PTHINC Virtualiza y cambia el tamaño de la pantalla en el servidor para entregar eficientemente actualizaciones de pantalla de alta fidelidad a una amplia gama de diferentes clientes, tamaños de pantalla y orientaciones de pantalla, incluidos los modos de visualización de retratos y paisajes. Esto permite que PTHINC proporcione la misma sesión web persistente en diferentes dispositivos de clientes. Por ejemplo, PTHINC puede proporcionar la misma sesión de navegación web adecuadamente escalada para visualizar en una computadora de escritorio y un PDA para que las mismas cookies, marcadores y otros metadatos estén disponibles continuamente en ambas máquinas simultáneamente.El enfoque de visualización virtual de PTHINCS aprovecha la información semántica disponible en los comandos de visualización y el hardware de video del lado del cliente para proporcionar mecanismos de pantalla remotos más eficientes que sean cruciales para admitir aplicaciones web más intensivas en pantalla. Dada la resolución de visualización limitada en PDA, PTHINCC maximiza el uso de bienes inmuebles de pantalla para visualización remota mediante la funcionalidad de control móvil desde la pantalla a los botones de control PDA disponibles, mejorando la usabilidad del sistema. Hemos implementado PTHINC en Windows Mobile y demostramos que funciona de manera transparente con aplicaciones existentes, sistemas de ventanas y sistemas operativos, y no requiere modificar, recompensar o relacionar el software existente. Hemos evaluado cuantitativamente PTHINC contra navegadores web PDA locales y otros enfoques de cliente delgado en dispositivos Pocket PC. Nuestros resultados experimentales demuestran que PTHINC proporciona un rendimiento de navegación web superior y es el único cliente delgado de PDA que admite efectivamente aplicaciones cruciales para ayudantes del navegador, como la reproducción de video. Este documento presenta el diseño e implementación de PTHINC. La Sección 2 describe el modelo de uso general y las características de usabilidad de PTHINC. La Sección 3 presenta el diseño y la arquitectura del sistema de PTHINC. La Sección 4 presenta resultados experimentales que miden el rendimiento de PTHINC en aplicaciones web y lo comparan con los navegadores PDA nativos y otros sistemas populares de cliente delgado PDA. La Sección 5 discute el trabajo relacionado. Finalmente, presentamos algunos comentarios finales.2. PTHINC Modelo de uso PTHINC es un sistema de cliente delgado que consiste en una aplicación simple de visor de clientes que se ejecuta en el PDA y un servidor que se ejecuta en una PC de productos básicos. El servidor aprovecha las PC más potentes para ejecutar navegadores web y otra lógica de aplicaciones. El cliente toma la entrada del usuario del teclado PDA Stylus y Virtual y los envía al servidor para pasar a las aplicaciones. Las actualizaciones de la pantalla se envían desde el servidor al cliente para que se muestre al usuario. Cuando se inicia el cliente PTHINC PDA, se presenta al usuario una interfaz gráfica simple donde se puede proporcionar información como la dirección del servidor y el puerto, la información de autenticación del usuario y la configuración de la sesión.Pthinc primero intenta conectarse al servidor y realizar el apretón de manos necesario. Una vez que este proceso se ha completado, PTHINCC presenta al usuario la visualización más reciente de su sesión. Si la sesión no existe, se crea una nueva sesión. Las sesiones existentes se pueden continuar sin problemas sin cambios en la configuración de la sesión o la configuración del servidor. A diferencia de otros sistemas de cliente delgado, PTHINC proporciona a un usuario un modelo de sesión web persistente en el que un usuario puede iniciar una sesión que ejecuta un navegador web y aplicaciones asociadas en el servidor, luego desconecte de esa sesión y vuelva a conectarse a él en cualquier momento. Cuando un usuario se vuelve a conectar a la sesión, todas las aplicaciones continúan ejecutándose donde el usuario lo dejó, para que el usuario pueda continuar trabajando como si nunca se desconectara. La capacidad de desconectarse y reconectarse en una sesión en cualquier momento es un beneficio importante para los usuarios de PDA inalámbricos móviles que pueden tener conectividad de red intermitente.El modelo de sesión web persistente de PTHINCS permite a un usuario reconectarse a una sesión web de dispositivos distintos de la que se inició originalmente la sesión web. Esto proporciona a los usuarios una movilidad perfecta en diferentes dispositivos. Si un usuario pierde su PDA, puede usar fácilmente otro PDA para acceder a su sesión web. Además, PTHINC permite a los usuarios usar dispositivos no PDA para acceder a las sesiones web también. Un usuario puede acceder a la misma sesión web persistente en una PC de escritorio que en un PDA, lo que permite a un usuario usar la misma sesión web de cualquier computadora.PTHINCS El modelo de sesión web persistente aborda un problema clave encontrado por los usuarios web móviles, la falta de un entorno web común en las computadoras. Los navegadores web a menudo almacenan información importante, como marcadores, cookies e historia, que les permiten funcionar de una manera mucho más útil. El problema que ocurre cuando un usuario se mueve entre las computadoras es que estos datos, que son específicos para la instalación de un navegador web, no pueden moverse con el usuario. Además, los navegadores web a menudo necesitan aplicaciones auxiliares para procesar diferentes contenido de medios, y esas aplicaciones pueden no estar disponibles consistentemente en todas las computadoras.Pthinc aborda este problema al permitir que un usuario use de forma remota exactamente el mismo entorno del navegador web y aplicaciones auxiliares desde cualquier computadora. Como resultado, PTHINC puede proporcionar un entorno de navegación web común y consistente para usuarios móviles en diferentes dispositivos sin requerirles que intenten sincronizar repetidamente diferentes entornos de navegación web en múltiples máquinas. Para permitir que un usuario acceda a la misma sesión web en diferentes dispositivos, PTHINC debe proporcionar mecanismos para admitir diferentes tamaños y resoluciones de visualización. Con este fin, PTHINC proporciona una función de zoom que permite a un usuario acercarse y salir de una pantalla y permite la visualización de una sesión de teclas de acceso directo de la web 144 Figura 1: Pthinc para cambiar el tamaño de la pantalla del dispositivo que se utiliza. Por ejemplo, si el servidor está ejecutando una sesión web en 1024 × 768, pero el cliente es un PDA con una resolución de visualización de 640 × 480, PTHINC cambiará la pantalla de escritorio para que se ajuste a la pantalla completa en la pantalla más pequeña del PDA.PTHINC proporciona al usuario de PDA la opción de aumentar el tamaño de la pantalla zoom en diferentes partes de la pantalla. Los usuarios a menudo están familiarizados con el diseño general de los sitios web comúnmente visitados, y pueden aprovechar esta función de cambio de tamaño para navegar mejor a través de las páginas web. Por ejemplo, un usuario puede alejarse de la pantalla para ver todo el contenido de la página y navegar hipervínculos, luego acercarse a una región de interés para una mejor vista. Para permitir que un usuario acceda a la misma sesión web en diferentes dispositivos, PTHINC también debe proporcionar mecanismos para admitir diferentes orientaciones de visualización. En un entorno de escritorio, los usuarios generalmente están acostumbrados a tener pantallas presentadas en modo paisajista donde el ancho de la pantalla es mayor que su altura. Sin embargo, en un entorno PDA, la elección no siempre es obvia. Algunos usuarios pueden preferir tener la pantalla en modo de retrato, ya que es más fácil mantener el dispositivo en sus manos, mientras que otros pueden preferir el modo de paisaje para minimizar la cantidad de desplazamiento lateral necesario para ver una página web. Para acomodar las preferencias de usuario de PDA, PTHINC proporciona una característica de orientación que le permite rotar perfectamente la pantalla entre el paisaje y el modo de retrato. El modo de paisaje es particularmente útil para los usuarios de PTHINC que con frecuencia acceden a sus sesiones web en dispositivos de escritorio y PDA, proporcionando a esos usuarios la misma configuración de paisaje familiar en diferentes dispositivos. Debido a que el espacio de pantalla es un recurso relativamente escaso en PDA, PTHINC se ejecuta en modo de pantalla completa para maximizar el área de pantalla disponible para mostrar la sesión web. Para poder usar toda la pantalla en el PDA y aún permitir que el usuario controle e interactúe con ella, Pthinc reutiliza los botones de acceso directo típicos que se encuentran en PDA para realizar todas las funciones de control disponibles para el usuario. Los botones utilizados por PTHINC no requieren cambios en el entorno del sistema operativo;Simplemente son interceptados por la aplicación del cliente PTHINC cuando se presionan. La Figura 1 muestra cómo PTHINC utiliza los botones de acceso directo para proporcionar una navegación fácil y mejorar la experiencia general del usuario. Estos botones no son específicos del dispositivo, y el diseño que se muestra es común a los dispositivos PocketPC ampliamente utilizados.PTHINC proporciona seis accesos directos para admitir su modelo de uso: • Rotar la pantalla: el botón de registro en el borde izquierdo se usa para rotar la pantalla entre el retrato y el modo de paisaje cada vez que se presiona el botón.• Zoom Out: el botón más a la izquierda en la parte inferior delantera se usa para alejar la visualización de la sesión web que proporciona una vista de los ojos de las aves de la sesión web.• Acercar: el segundo botón más a la izquierda en la parte delantera inferior se usa para ampliar la sesión web para ver más claramente el contenido de interés.• Scroll direccional: el botón central en la parte inferior delantera se usa para desplazarse por la pantalla usando un solo botón de control de una manera que ya es familiar para los usuarios de PDA. Esta característica es particularmente útil cuando el usuario se ha acercado a una región de la pantalla, de modo que solo la parte de la pantalla es visible en la pantalla.• Mostrar/ocultar el teclado: el segundo botón más derecho en la parte inferior delantera se usa para levantar un teclado virtual dibujado en la pantalla para dispositivos que no tienen teclado físico. El teclado virtual utiliza mecanismos estándar de PDA OS, proporcionando portabilidad en diferentes entornos PDA.• Sesión de cierre: el botón más a la derecha en la parte inferior delantera se usa para desconectarse de la sesión de PTHINC.PTHINC utiliza la pantalla táctil PDA, el lápiz óptico y los mecanismos estándar de la interfaz de usuario para proporcionar una metáfora de interfaz de usuario puntiaguda similar a la proporcionada por el mouse en un entorno de computación de escritorio tradicional.PTHINC no usa un cursor ya que los entornos PDA no proporcionan uno. En su lugar, un usuario puede usar el lápiz para tocar diferentes secciones de la pantalla táctil para indicar el enfoque de entrada. Un solo toque en la pantalla táctil genera un evento de mouse de clic único correspondiente. Un doble toque en la pantalla táctil genera un evento de mouse de doble clic correspondiente.PTHINC proporciona una emulación de mouse de dos botones mediante el uso del lápiz para presionar en la pantalla durante un segundo para generar un clic derecho del mouse. Todas estas acciones son idénticas a la forma en que los usuarios ya interactúan con las aplicaciones PDA en el entorno Common PocketPC. En la navegación web, los usuarios pueden hacer clic en hipervínculos y centrarse en los cuadros de entrada simplemente aprovechando el área de interés deseada de interés. A diferencia de los navegadores web locales de PDA y otras aplicaciones PDA, PTHINC aprovecha metáforas de interfaz de usuario de escritorio más potentes para permitir a los usuarios manipular múltiples ventanas de aplicaciones abiertas en lugar de estar limitadas a una sola ventana de aplicación en cualquier momento dado. Esto proporciona una mayor flexibilidad de navegación más allá de lo que está disponible actualmente en los dispositivos PDA. Similar a un entorno de escritorio, las ventanas del navegador y otras ventanas de aplicaciones se pueden mover presionando hacia abajo y arrastrando el lápiz similar a un mouse.3. Arquitectura del sistema PTHINC PTHINC se basa en la arquitectura de pantalla remota Thinc [1] para proporcionar un sistema de cliente delgado para PDA.PTHINC virtualiza la pantalla en el servidor aprovechando la capa de abstracción del dispositivo de video, que se encuentra debajo del servidor del servidor y por encima del FrameBuffer. Esta es una capa bien definida, de bajo nivel y dependiente del dispositivo que expone el hardware de video al sistema de visualización.Pthinc logra esto a través de un controlador de visualización virtual simple que intercepta los comandos de dibujo, los empaquetan y los envía a través de la red.145 Mientras que otros enfoques del cliente delgado interceptan comandos de visualización en otras capas del subsistema de pantalla, el enfoque de virtualización de la pantalla PTHINCS proporciona algunos beneficios clave para soportar eficientemente clientes PDA. Por ejemplo, la interceptación de comandos de visualización en una capa más alta entre las aplicaciones y el sistema de ventanas, como lo hace X [17], requiere replicar y ejecutar una gran funcionalidad en el PDA que tradicionalmente proporciona el sistema de ventanas de escritorio. Dado tanto el tamaño como la complejidad de los sistemas de ventanas tradicionales, intentar replicar esta funcionalidad en el entorno PDA restringido habría demostrado ser una tarea desalentadora y quizás inviable. Además, las aplicaciones y el sistema de ventanas a menudo requieren una estrecha sincronización en su operación e imponer una red inalámbrica entre ellas al ejecutar las aplicaciones en el servidor y el sistema de ventanas en el cliente degradaría significativamente el rendimiento. Por otro lado, interceptar en una capa inferior al extraer píxeles del marrebuffer, ya que se representan proporciona una solución simple que requiere muy poca funcionalidad en el cliente PDA, pero también puede dar como resultado un rendimiento degradado. La razón es que para cuando el servidor de pantalla remota intenta enviar actualizaciones de pantalla, ha perdido toda la información semántica que puede haberle ayudado a codificar de manera eficiente, y debe recurrir a un mecanismo de codificación genérico y costoso en el servidor, así como.Un mecanismo de decodificación potencialmente costoso en el cliente PDA limitado. A diferencia de los enfoques de intercepción de alto y bajo nivel, el enfoque de PTHINCS de interceptar en el controlador del dispositivo proporciona un equilibrio efectivo entre la simplicidad del cliente y el servidor, y la capacidad de codificar y decodificar eficientemente las actualizaciones de la pantalla. Al usar un enfoque de visualización virtual de bajo nivel, PTHINC puede codificar eficientemente los comandos de visualización de aplicaciones utilizando solo un pequeño conjunto de comandos de bajo nivel. En un entorno PDA, este conjunto de comandos proporciona un componente crucial para mantener la simplicidad del cliente en el entorno PDA con restricciones de recursos. Los comandos de visualización se muestran en la Tabla 1 y funcionan de la siguiente manera. Copiar instruye al cliente que copie una región de la pantalla desde su FrameBuffer local a otra ubicación. Este comando mejora la experiencia del usuario al acelerar el desplazamiento y el movimiento de la ventana opaca sin tener que reenviar los datos de la pantalla del servidor. Sfill, Pfill y Bitmap son comandos que pintan una región de tamaño fijo en la pantalla. Son útiles para acelerar la visualización de fondos de ventanas sólidas, patrones de escritorio, fondos de páginas web, dibujo de texto y ciertas operaciones en programas de manipulación de gráficos. Sfill llena una región considerable en la pantalla con un solo color. Pfill replica un mosaico sobre una región de pantalla. Bitmap realiza un relleno con un mapa de bits y ceros como un colorante para aplicar un color de primer plano y fondo. Finalmente, RAW se usa para transmitir datos de píxeles no codificados para mostrarse literalmente en una región de la pantalla. Este comando se invoca como último recurso si el servidor no puede emplear ningún otro comando, y es el único comando que puede comprimirse para mitigar su impacto en el ancho de banda de la red.PTHINC ofrece sus comandos utilizando un mecanismo de actualización de servidor sin bloqueo, donde tan pronto como se generan actualizaciones de visualización en el servidor, se envían al cliente. Los clientes no están obligados a solicitar explícitamente actualizaciones de visualización, minimizando así el impacto que la latencia de red variable típica de los enlaces inalámbricos puede tener en la capacidad de respuesta del sistema. Teniendo en cuenta que la descripción del comando de recursos copia copiar un área de búfer de cuadro a coordenadas especificadas Sfill llena un área con un valor de color de color de píxeles dado un área con un patrón de píxel dado llena una región con un patrón de bits de pantalla cruda de visualización sin procesar en unDada ubicación Tabla 1: Los comandos de visualización del protocolo PTHINC PDA limitados y las redes inalámbricas pueden no poder mantener un servidor rápido que genere una gran cantidad de actualizaciones, PTHINCC puede unirse, recortar y descartar actualizaciones automáticamente si se produce la pérdida de red o la congestión, o el cliente no puede mantenerse al día con la tasa de actualizaciones. Este tipo de comportamiento resulta crucial en un entorno de navegación web, donde, por ejemplo, una página puede ser redactada varias veces a medida que el navegador lo representa en la marcha. En este caso, el PDA solo recibirá y representará el resultado final, lo que claramente es que todo el usuario es interesante en ver.Pthinc prioriza la entrega de actualizaciones al PDA utilizando un programador de actualización preventiva de tamaño más corto (SRSF). SRSF es análogo a la programación del tiempo de procesamiento más corto, que se sabe que es óptimo para minimizar el tiempo de respuesta medio en un sistema interactivo. En un entorno de navegación web, los trabajos cortos están asociados con el texto y los componentes básicos de diseño de página, como el fondo de las páginas, que son contenido web crítico para el usuario. Por otro lado, los trabajos grandes a menudo son elementos de embellecimiento de menor prioridad o, lo que es peor, pancartas y anuncios de página web, que tienen un valor cuestionable para el usuario mientras está navegando por la página. Usando SRSF, PTHINC puede maximizar la utilización del ancho de banda relativamente escaso disponible en la conexión inalámbrica entre el PDA y el servidor.3.1 Mostrar administración para permitir a los usuarios acceder a su navegador web y aplicaciones auxiliares desde una computadora de escritorio en casa como desde un PDA mientras está en la carretera, PTHINC proporciona un mecanismo de cambio de tamaño para acercarse y salir de la visualización de una sesión web.El cambio de cambio de PTHINC es completamente compatible con el servidor, no por el cliente. El servidor resume las actualizaciones para que se ajusten dentro de la vista PDAS antes de transmitirse a través de la red.PTHINC usa algoritmo de remuestreo de los Fants para cambiar el tamaño de las actualizaciones de píxeles. Esto proporciona actualizaciones suaves y visuales con antialiasing adecuadamente y solo tiene requisitos computacionales modestos.El enfoque de cambio de tamaño de PTHINC tiene una serie de ventajas. Primero, permite que el PDA aproveche la potencia computacional ampliamente superior del servidor para usar algoritmos de remuestreo de alta calidad y producir actualizaciones de mayor calidad para que la PDA lo muestre. En segundo lugar, cambiar el tamaño de la pantalla no se traduce en requisitos de recursos adicionales para el PDA, ya que no necesita realizar ningún trabajo adicional. Finalmente, se alcanza una mejor utilización de la red inalámbrica, ya que reescalar las actualizaciones reduce sus requisitos de ancho de banda. Para permitir a los usuarios orientar sus pantallas en un PDA para proporcionar una experiencia de visualización que mejor acomode las preferencias de los usuarios y el diseño de páginas o aplicaciones web, PTHINC proporciona un mecanismo de rotación de visualización para cambiar entre modos de visualización de paisajes y retratos.La rotación de la pantalla PTHINC es completamente compatible con el cliente, no por el servidor.PTHINC no recalcula explícitamente la ometría GE146 de las actualizaciones de visualización para realizar la rotación, lo que sería computacionalmente costoso. En cambio, PTHINC simplemente cambia la forma en que los datos se copian en el FrameBuffer para cambiar entre los modos de visualización. Cuando está en modo retrato, los datos se copian a lo largo de las filas del FrameBuffer de izquierda a derecha. Cuando está en modo paisajista, los datos se copian a lo largo de las columnas del FrameBuffer de arriba a abajo. Estas técnicas muy rápidas y simples reemplazan un conjunto de operaciones de copia con otra e imponen una sobrecarga de rendimiento.PTHINC proporciona su propio mecanismo de rotación para admitir una amplia gama de dispositivos sin imponer requisitos de características adicionales en el PDA. Aunque algunos dispositivos PDA más nuevos proporcionan soporte nativo para diferentes orientaciones, este mecanismo no es dinámico y requiere que el usuario gire la interfaz de usuario completa PDAS antes de comenzar el cliente PTHINC. Windows Mobile proporciona mecanismos de API nativos para que las aplicaciones PDA rotaran su interfaz de usuario sobre la marcha, pero estos mecanismos ofrecen un bajo rendimiento y la calidad de la visualización a medida que la rotación se realiza ingenuamente y no es completamente precisa.3.2 Video de reproducción de video El video se ha convertido gradualmente en una parte integral de la World Wide Web, y su presencia solo continuará aumentando. Los sitios web hoy en día no solo usan gráficos animados y flash para entregar contenido web de manera atractiva, sino que también utilizan videos de transmisión para enriquecer la interfaz web. Los usuarios pueden ver noticias previamente grabadas y en vivo en CNN, ver lo más destacados de los deportes en ESPN e incluso buscar en una gran colección de videos en Google Video. Para permitir que las aplicaciones proporcionen una reproducción de video eficiente, se han creado interfaces en sistemas de visualización que permiten a los controladores de dispositivos de video exponer sus capacidades de hardware a las aplicaciones.PTHINC aprovecha estas interfaces y su enfoque de controlador de dispositivos virtuales para proporcionar un puente virtual entre el cliente remoto y su hardware y las aplicaciones, y admite transparentemente la reproducción de video. Además de esta arquitectura, PTHINC utiliza el espacio de colores YUV para codificar el contenido de video, que proporciona una serie de beneficios. Primero, se ha vuelto cada vez más común que el hardware de video PDA admite de forma nativa YUV y pueda realizar la conversión y escala del espacio de colores automáticamente. Como resultado, PTHINC puede proporcionar reproducción de video de pantalla completa sin ningún éxito de rendimiento. En segundo lugar, el uso de YUV permite una representación más eficiente de los datos de RGB sin pérdida de calidad, aprovechando la capacidad de los ojos humanos para distinguir mejor las diferencias en el brillo que en el color. En particular, PTHINC usa el formato YV12, que permite codificar datos RGB a todo color utilizando solo 12 bits por píxel. En tercer lugar, los datos de YUV se producen como uno de los últimos pasos del proceso de decodificación de la mayoría de los códecs de video, lo que permite que PTHINC proporcione reproducción de video de una manera que sea independiente del formato. Finalmente, incluso si el hardware de video PDAS no puede acelerar la reproducción, el proceso de conversión del espacio de colores es lo suficientemente simple como para no imponer requisitos irrazonables en el PDA. Un ejemplo más concreto de cómo PTHINCC aprovecha el hardware de video PDA para admitir la reproducción de video en nuestra implementación de prototipo en el popular PDA Dell Axim X51V, que está equipado con el Acelerador Multimedia Intel 2700G. En este caso, PTHINC crea un búfer fuera de pantalla en la memoria de video y escribe y lee a partir de esta región de memoria datos en el formato YV12. Cuando llega un nuevo marco de video, los datos de video se copian desde el búfer a la Figura 2: Test Bode Experimental Una superficie de superposición en la memoria de video, que es independiente de la superficie normal utilizada para el dibujo tradicional. A medida que los datos YV12 se colocan en la superposición, el Acelerator Intel realiza automáticamente la conversión y la escala del espacio de color. Al usar la superficie de superposición, PTHINC no tiene necesidad de volver a dibujar la pantalla una vez que termina la reproducción de video ya que la superficie superpuesta no se ve afectada. Además, se pueden manipular regiones de superposición específicas aprovechando el hardware de video, por ejemplo, para realizar la interpolación lineal de hardware para suavizar el marco y mostrarlo con pantalla completa, y para hacer una rotación automática cuando el cliente se ejecuta en modo paisajista.4. Resultados experimentales Hemos implementado un prototipo PTHINC que ejecuta el cliente en dispositivos Pocket PC de Windows Mobile ampliamente utilizados y el servidor en los sistemas operativos de Windows y Linux. Para demostrar su efectividad en el soporte de aplicaciones web inalámbricas móviles, hemos medido su rendimiento en las aplicaciones web. Presentamos resultados experimentales en diferentes dispositivos PDA para dos aplicaciones web populares, navegando por páginas web y reproduciendo contenido de video desde la web. Comparamos PTHINC con aplicaciones web nativas que se ejecutan localmente en el PDA para demostrar la mejora que PTHINC puede proporcionar sobre el enfoque tradicional del cliente grasa. También comparamos PTHINC con tres de los clientes delgados más utilizados que pueden ejecutarse en PDA, Citrix Meta-FrameXP [2], Microsoft Remote Desktop [3] y VNC (Virtual Network Computing) [16]. Seguimos la práctica común y nos referimos a Citrix MetaFrameXP y Microsoft Remote Desktop por sus respectivos protocolos de visualización remota, ICA (arquitectura informática independiente) y RDP (protocolo de escritorio remoto).4.1 Testbed experimental realizamos nuestros experimentos web utilizando dos PDA de PC de bolsillo inalámbrico diferentes en un Bed de prueba de red Wi-Fi aislado, como se muestra en la Figura 2. El Testbed consistió en dos dispositivos de clientes PDA, un monitor de paquetes, un servidor de cliente delgado y un servidor web. A excepción de los PDA, todas las otras máquinas eran servidores IBM Netfinity 4500R con CPU Dual de 933 MHz Intel PIII y 512 MB RAM y se conectaron en una red rápida conmutada de 100 Mbps. El servidor web utilizado fue Apache 1.3.27, el emulador de red fue Nistnet 2.0.12 y el monitor de paquetes fue etéreo 0.10.9. Los clientes PDA conectados a la prueba de prueba a través de un punto de acceso inalámbrico 802.11b Lucent Orinoco AP-2000. Todos los experimentos que usan la red inalámbrica se realizaron a menos de diez pies del punto de acceso, por lo que consideramos que la cantidad de pérdida de paquetes es insignificante en nuestros experimentos. Se usaron dos PDA de PC de bolsillo para proporcionar resultados en modelos más antiguos y menos potentes y modelos más nuevos de mayor rendimiento. El modelo anterior era un Dell Axim X5 con 147 Cliente 1024 × 768 640 × 480 CLIC DE RESIONA DE RESIMENTO DE LA PROFUNDSí No Tabla 2: Configuración de la configuración de la prueba de cliente delgado una CPU PXA255 PXA255 de 400 MHz y 64 MB RAM ejecutando Windows Mobile 2003 y una tarjeta Dell TrueMobile 1180 2.4GHz CompactFlash para redes inalámbricas. El modelo más nuevo era un Dell Axim X51V con una CPU XPA270 XPA270 de 624 MHz y 64 MB RAM con Windows Mobile 5.0 y una red inalámbrica integrada 802.11b. El X51V tiene un acelerador multimedia Intel 2700G con memoria de video de 16 MB. Ambos PDA son capaces de color de 16 bits pero tienen diferentes tamaños de pantalla y resoluciones de visualización. El X5 tiene una pantalla diagonal de 3.5 pulgadas con resolución de 240 × 320. El X51V tiene una pantalla diagonal de 3.7 pulgadas con 480 × 640. Los cuatro clientes delgados que utilizamos admiten diferentes niveles de calidad de pantalla como se resume en la Tabla 2. El cliente RDP solo admite una resolución fija de pantalla de 640 × 480 en el servidor con profundidad de color de 8 bits, mientras que otras plataformas proporcionan niveles más altos de calidad de visualización. Para proporcionar una comparación justa en todas las plataformas, realizamos nuestros experimentos con sesiones de cliente delgado configurados para dos posibles resoluciones, 1024 × 768 y 640 × 480. Tanto ICA como VNC se configuraron para usar la resolución PDA nativa de profundidad de color de 16 bits. El prototipo PTHINC actual utiliza el color de 24 bits directamente y el cliente muestra las actualizaciones de la profundidad de color de 16 bits disponibles en el PDA. RDP se configuró utilizando solo una profundidad de color de 8 bits, ya que no admite una mejor profundidad de color. Dado que tanto PTHINC como ICA proporcionan la capacidad de ver la pantalla redimensionada para que se ajuste a la pantalla, medimos a ambos clientes con y sin la pantalla redimensionada para que se ajuste a la pantalla PDA. Cada cliente delgado fue probado utilizando el paisaje en lugar del modo de retrato cuando está disponible. Todos los sistemas se ejecutan en el X51V podrían ejecutarse en modo paisajista porque el hardware proporciona una función de modo de paisaje. Sin embargo, el X5 no proporciona esta funcionalidad. Solo PTHINC admite directamente el modo de paisaje, por lo que fue el único sistema que podría ejecutarse en modo paisajista tanto en X5 como en X51V. Para proporcionar una comparación justa, también estandarizamos en hardware y sistemas operativos comunes siempre que sea posible. Todos los sistemas utilizaron el servidor NetFinity como el servidor de cliente delgado. Para los dos sistemas diseñados para servidores de Windows, ICA y RDP, ejecutamos el servidor Windows 2003 en el servidor. Para los otros sistemas que admiten servidores basados en X, VNC y PTHINC, ejecutamos la distribución inestable de Debian Linux con el kernel Linux 2.6.10 en el servidor. Utilizamos las últimas versiones del servidor de cliente delgado disponibles en cada plataforma en el momento de nuestros experimentos, a saber, Citrix Metaframe XP Server para la versión de la función Windows 3, Microsoft Remote Desktop integrado en Windows XP y Windows 2003 usando RDP 5.2 y VNC 4.0.4.2 Benchmarks de aplicaciones Utilizamos dos puntos de referencia de aplicaciones web para nuestros experimentos basados en dos escenarios de aplicaciones comunes, navegar por páginas web y reproducir contenido de video desde la web. Dado que muchos sistemas de cliente delgado, incluidos dos de los probados están cerrados y patentados, medimos su rendimiento de manera no invasiva al capturar el tráfico de red con un monitor de paquetes y usar una variante de evaluación comparativa de cámara lenta [13] desarrollada previamente para medir delgadas-Cliente rendimiento en entornos PDA [10]. Esta metodología de medición representa tanto el desacoplamiento de visualización que puede ocurrir entre el cliente y el servidor en los sistemas de cliente delgado, así como el tiempo de procesamiento del cliente, lo que puede ser significativo en el caso de PDA. Para medir el rendimiento de la navegación web, utilizamos un punto de referencia de navegación web basada en la prueba de carga de la página de texto web desde la suite de referencia de bench Ziff-Davis [7]. El punto de referencia consiste en una carga controlada de JavaScript de 55 páginas desde el servidor web. Las páginas contienen texto y gráficos con páginas que varían en tamaño. Los gráficos son imágenes incrustadas en formatos GIF y JPEG. El punto de referencia I-Bench original se modificó para la evaluación comparativa de cámara lenta al introducir retrasos de varios segundos entre las páginas usando JavaScript. Luego se ejecutaron dos pruebas, una donde los retrasos se agregaron entre cada página, y una donde las páginas se cargan continuamente sin esperar que se muestren en el cliente. En la primera prueba, los retrasos se ajustaron suficientemente en cada caso para garantizar que cada página se pueda recibir y mostrar en el cliente por completo sin superposición temporal para transferir los datos que pertenecen a dos páginas consecutivas. Utilizamos el monitor de paquetes para registrar el tráfico de paquetes para cada ejecución del punto de referencia, luego utilizamos las marcas de tiempo del primer y último paquete en la traza para obtener nuestras medidas de latencia [10]. El monitor de paquetes también registró la cantidad de datos transmitidos entre el cliente y el servidor. La relación entre el tráfico de datos en las dos pruebas produce un factor de escala. Este factor de escala muestra la pérdida de datos entre el servidor y el cliente debido a la incapacidad del cliente para procesar los datos lo suficientemente rápido. El producto del factor de escala con la medición de latencia produce la verdadera contabilidad de latencia para el tiempo de procesamiento del cliente. Para ejecutar el punto de referencia de navegación web, utilizamos Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 que se ejecuta en el servidor de cliente delgado para los clientes delgados y Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile para 2003 y móvil para 5.0 para los navegadores nativos en los PDA X5 y X51V, respectivamente. En todos los casos, el navegador web utilizado fue dimensionado para llenar toda la región de visualización disponible. Para medir el rendimiento de reproducción de video, utilizamos un punto de referencia de video que consistía en reproducir un video clip MPEG-1 de 34.75s que contiene una combinación de noticias y programación de entretenimiento en resolución de pantalla completa. El video clip es de 5.11 MB y consta de 834 marcos de 352x240 píxeles con una velocidad de cuadro ideal de 24 cuadros/seg. Medimos el rendimiento del video utilizando la evaluación comparativa de cámara lenta mediante el monitoreo del tráfico de paquetes resultante a dos tasas de reproducción, 1 cuadros/segundo (FPS) y 24 fps, y comparando los resultados para determinar los retrasos de reproducción y las caídas de cuadros que ocurren a 24 FPS para medir el video generalCalidad [13]. Por ejemplo, el 100% de calidad significa que todos los cuadros de video se reproducían a velocidad en tiempo real. Por otro lado, el 50% de calidad podría significar que la mitad de los datos de video se eliminaron, o que el clip tardó el doble en reproducirse a pesar de que se mostraron todos los datos de video. Para ejecutar el punto de referencia de video, utilizamos Windows Media Player 9 para servidores de cliente delgado basados en Windows, Mplayer 1.0 Pre 6 para servidores de cliente delgado basado en X y Windows Media Player 9 Mobile y 10 Mobile para los reproductores de video nativos que se ejecutan localmenteen los PDA x5 y x51v, respectivamente. En todos los casos, el reproductor de video utilizado fue dimensionado para llenar toda la región de visualización disponible.4.3 Mediciones Las Figuras 3 y 4 muestran los resultados de la ejecución de las cejas web148 0 1 10 100 PTHINC DIGEL DISTE HTHINCICA DIZED ICAVNCRDPLOCAL LATORMA (S) AXIMA X5 (640x480 o menos) Axim x51V (640x480) Axim X5 (1024x768) Axim X51V (1024x768)Figura 3: Bencillo de navegación: punto de referencia de latencia de página promedio. Para cada plataforma, mostramos resultados para hasta cuatro configuraciones diferentes, dos en el X5 y dos en el X51V, dependiendo de si cada configuración fue compatible. Sin embargo, no todas las plataformas podrían admitir todas las configuraciones. El navegador local solo se ejecuta en la resolución de visualización del PDA, 480 × 680 o menos para el X51V y el X5. RDP solo funciona a 640 × 480. Ninguna plataforma podría admitir la resolución de visualización 1024 × 768. ICA solo funcionó en el X5 y no pudo ejecutarse en el X51V porque no funcionó en Windows Mobile 5. La Figura 3 muestra la latencia promedio por página web para cada plataforma.PTHINC proporciona la latencia de navegación web promedio más baja en ambos PDA. En el X5, PTHINC funciona hasta 70 veces mejor que otros sistemas de cliente delgado y 8 veces mejor que el navegador local. En el X51V, PTHINCC se desempeña hasta 80 veces mejor que otros sistemas de cliente delgado y 7 veces mejor que el navegador nativo. De hecho, todos los clientes delgados, excepto VNC, superan el navegador PDA local, lo que demuestra los beneficios de rendimiento del enfoque de cliente delgado. Los estudios de usabilidad han demostrado que las páginas web deberían tardar menos de un segundo en descargar para que el usuario experimente una experiencia de navegación web ininterrumpida [14]. Las mediciones muestran que solo los clientes delgados entregan latencias de página web de Subsecond. En contraste, el navegador local requiere más de 3 segundos en promedio por página web. El navegador local funciona peor, ya que necesita ejecutar un navegador web más limitado para procesar el HTML, JavaScript y hacer toda la representación utilizando las capacidades limitadas del PDA. Los clientes delgados pueden aprovechar el hardware del servidor más rápido y un navegador web altamente sintonizado para procesar el contenido web mucho más rápido. La Figura 3 muestra que RDP es la próxima plataforma más rápida después de PTHINC. Sin embargo, RDP solo puede funcionar a una resolución fija de 640 × 480 y una profundidad de color de 8 bits. Además, RDP también recorta la pantalla al tamaño de la pantalla PDA para que no sea necesario enviar actualizaciones que no sean visibles en la pantalla PDA. Esto proporciona un beneficio de rendimiento suponiendo que el contenido web restante no se ve, pero degrada el rendimiento cuando un usuario se desplaza por la pantalla para ver otro contenido web. RDP logra su rendimiento con una calidad de pantalla significativamente más baja en comparación con los otros clientes delgados y con un recorte de visualización adicional no utilizado por otros sistemas. Como resultado, RDP Performance solo no proporciona una comparación completa con las otras plataformas. En contraste, PTHINC proporciona el rendimiento más rápido y al mismo tiempo proporciona una calidad de visualización igual o mejor que los otros sistemas.0 1 10 100 1000 PTHINC DISELED PTHINCICA DISET DISET ICAVNCRDPLOCAL DataSize (KB) Plataforma Axim X5 (640x480 o menos) Axim X51V (640x480) Axim X5 (1024x768) Axim X51V (1024x768) Figura 4: Benchmark de browsing: Página de promedio de datos acreditado y videos y vales de datos de la página de promedio.ICA proporciona una calidad de visualización similar a PTHINC, estos sistemas proporcionan una comparación más justa de los diferentes enfoques de cliente delgado. ICA funciona peor en parte porque utiliza primitivas de visualización de nivel superior que requieren costos adicionales de procesamiento del cliente. VNC funciona peor en parte porque pierde datos de visualización debido a su mecanismo de entrega de clientes del cliente y debido a los costos de procesamiento del cliente en descomprimir primitivas de píxeles sin procesar. En ambos casos, su rendimiento fue limitado en parte porque sus clientes de PDA no pudieron mantenerse al día con la tasa a la que se mostraban páginas web. La Figura 3 también muestra mediciones para aquellos clientes delgados que admiten el cambio de tamaño de la pantalla para que se ajuste a la pantalla PDA, a saber, ICA y PTHINC. El cambio de tamaño requiere un procesamiento adicional, lo que da como resultado latencias de página web promedio más lenta. Las mediciones muestran que el retraso adicional incurrido por ICA al cambiar el tamaño versus no cambiar el tamaño es mucho más sustancial que para PTHINC. ICA realiza un cambio de tamaño en el cliente PDA más lento. En contraste, PTHINCC aprovecha el servidor más potente para cambiar el tamaño, reduciendo la diferencia de rendimiento entre cambiar el tamaño y no el cambio de tamaño. A diferencia de ICA, PTHINC puede proporcionar latencias de descarga de la página web de Subsecond en ambos casos. La Figura 4 muestra los datos transferidos en KB por página al ejecutar la versión de movimiento lento de las pruebas. Todas las plataformas tienen modestos requisitos de transferencia de datos de aproximadamente 100 kb por página o menos. Esto está dentro de la capacidad de ancho de banda de las redes Wi-Fi. Las mediciones muestran que el navegador local no transfiere la menor cantidad de datos. Esto es sorprendente ya que HTML a menudo se considera una representación muy compacta del contenido. En cambio, RDP es la plataforma más eficiente de ancho de banda, en gran parte como resultado de usar solo profundidad de color de 8 bits y recorte de pantalla para que no transfiera la página web completa al cliente.En general, por ejemplo, los requisitos de datos más grandes, un poco más que VNC. Esto es en gran parte el resultado de los prototipos PTHINC actuales que falta de soporte nativo para datos de color de 16 bits en el protocolo de cable. Sin embargo, este resultado también destaca el rendimiento de PTHINC, ya que es más rápido que todos los demás sistemas, incluso mientras se transfiere más datos. Además, como los modelos PDA más nuevos admiten un color completo de 24 bits, estos resultados indican que PTHINC continuará proporcionando un buen rendimiento de navegación web. Dado que la usabilidad y la calidad de la pantalla son tan importantes como el rendimiento, las Figuras 5 a 8 comparan capturas de pantalla de los diferentes clientes delgados al mostrar una página web, en este caso del popular sitio web de noticias de la BBC. Except for ICA, all of the screenshots were taken on the X51v in landscape mode 149 Figure 5: Browser Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 6: Browser Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 7: Browser Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 8: Browser Screenshot: pTHINC Resized1024x768 Uso de la configuración de resolución de visualización máxima para cada plataforma dada en la Tabla 2. La captura de pantalla ICA se tomó en el X5 ya que ICA no se ejecuta en el X51V. Si bien las capturas de pantalla carecen de la fidelidad visual de la pantalla del dispositivo real, se pueden hacer varias observaciones. La Figura 5 muestra que RDP no admite el modo de pantalla completa y desperdicia mucho espacio de pantalla para controles y elementos de UI, lo que requiere que el usuario se desplace para acceder al contenido completo de la sesión de navegación web. La Figura 6 muestra que VNC hace un mejor uso del espacio de pantalla y proporciona una mejor calidad de visualización, pero aún obliga al usuario a desplazarse para ver la página web debido a su falta de soporte para cambiar el tamaño. La Figura 7 muestra la capacidad de ICAS para mostrar la página web completa dada su soporte de cambio de tamaño, pero que su falta de capacidad de paisaje y algoritmo de cambio de tamaño más pobre comprometen significativamente la calidad de la visualización. En contraste, la Figura 8 muestra PTHINC utilizando el cambio de cambio para proporcionar una pantalla completa de alta calidad del ancho completo de la página web.Pthinc maximiza toda la región de observación moviendo todos los controles a los botones PDA. Además, PTHINC aprovecha el poder computacional del servidor para usar un algoritmo de cambio de tamaño de alta calidad para cambiar el tamaño de la pantalla para que se ajuste a la pantalla PDA sin sobrecarga significativa. Las figuras 9 y 10 muestran los resultados de ejecutar el punto de referencia de reproducción de video. Para cada plataforma, excepto ICA, mostramos resultados para una configuración X5 y X51V. ICA no pudo funcionar en el X51V como se señaló anteriormente. Las mediciones se realizaron utilizando configuraciones que reflejaron el entorno que un usuario tendría que acceder a una sesión web desde una computadora de escritorio y un PDA. Como tal, se usó una resolución de visualización del servidor 1024 × 768 siempre que fue posible y el video se mostró en pantalla completa. RDP se limitó a la resolución de visualización de 640 × 480 como se señaló anteriormente. Dado que ver toda la pantalla de video es la única opción realmente utilizable, redimensionamos la pantalla para que se ajuste a la pantalla PDA para aquellas plataformas que admitieron esta función, a saber, ICA y PTHINC. La Figura 9 muestra la calidad del video para cada plataforma.Pthinc es el único cliente delgado capaz de proporcionar una calidad de reproducción de video perfecta, similar al reproductor de video PDA nativo. Todos los otros clientes delgados ofrecen una calidad de video muy pobre. Con la excepción de RDP en el X51V que proporcionó una calidad de video inaceptable del 35%, ninguno de los otros sistemas pudo lograr una calidad de video del 10%. VNC e ICA tienen la peor calidad al 8% en el dispositivo X5.El soporte de video nativo de PTHINCS permite un rendimiento de video superior, mientras que otros clientes delgados sufren de su incapacidad para distinguir el video de las actualizaciones de visualización normales. Intentan aplicar algoritmos de compresión ineficaces y costosos en los datos de video y no pueden mantenerse al día con el flujo de actualizaciones generadas, lo que resulta en marcos caídos o largos tiempos de reproducción. VNC sufre más lejos de su modelo de actualización del cliente-Pull porque los marcos de video se generan más rápido que la tasa a la que el cliente puede procesar y enviar solicitudes al servidor para obtener la siguiente actualización de visualización.

El reproductor nativo es la plataforma más eficiente de ancho de banda, que envía menos de 6 MB de datos, que corresponde a aproximadamente 1.2 Mbps de ancho de banda.La calidad de video del 100% de PTHINCS requiere aproximadamente 25 MB de datos que corresponden a un uso de ancho de banda de menos de 6 Mbps. Mientras que los otros clientes delgados envían menos datos que Thinc, lo hacen porque están dejando caer datos de video, lo que resulta en una calidad de video degradada. Las figuras 11 a 14 comparan capturas de pantalla de los diferentes clientes delgados al mostrar el videoclip. A excepción de ICA, todas las capturas de pantalla se tomaron en el X51V en modo paisajista utilizando la configuración de resolución de visualización máxima para cada plataforma dada en la Tabla 2. La captura de pantalla ICA se tomó en el X5 ya que ICA no se ejecuta en el X51V. Las Figuras 11 y 12 muestran que RDP y VNC no pueden mostrar todo el marco de video en la pantalla PDA. RDP desata el espacio de pantalla para elementos de interfaz de usuario y VNC solo muestra la esquina superior del marco de video en la pantalla. La Figura 13 muestra que ICA proporciona un cambio de tamaño para mostrar todo el marco de video, pero no cambió el tamaño proporcional de los datos de video, lo que resultó en artefactos de visualización extraños. En contraste, la Figura 14 muestra PTHINC utilizando el cambio de cambio para proporcionar una pantalla completa de alta calidad de todo el marco de video.PTHINC proporciona una pantalla de video visualmente más atractiva que RDP, VNC o ICA.5. Trabajo relacionado Varios estudios han examinado el rendimiento de la navegación web de la computación del cliente delgado [13, 19, 10]. La capacidad de los clientes delgados para mejorar el rendimiento de la navegación web en los PDA inalámbricos se demostró cuantitativamente en un estudio previo por uno de los autores [10]. Este estudio demostró que los clientes delgados pueden proporcionar un rendimiento de navegación web más rápido y una mayor funcionalidad de navegación web. El estudio consideró una amplia gama de contenido web que incluye contenido de sistemas de información médica. Nuestro trabajo se basa en este estudio anterior y considere cuestiones importantes, como cómo los clientes delgados existentes utilizables se encuentran en los entornos PDA, las compensaciones entre la usabilidad y el rendimiento del cliente delgado, el rendimiento en diferentes dispositivos PDA y el rendimiento de los clientes delgados en la web común-Las aplicaciones relacionadas como el video. Se han desarrollado muchos clientes delgados y algunos tienen clientes PDA, incluidos Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetRAframe XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GotomyPC [5] y Tarantella [18]. Estos sistemas se diseñaron primero para informática de escritorio y modernizados para PDA. A diferencia de PTHINC, no abordan los problemas clave de la arquitectura del sistema y la usabilidad importantes para los PDA. Esto limita su calidad de pantalla, rendimiento del sistema, espacio de pantalla disponible y usabilidad general en PDA.PTHINC se basa en trabajos anteriores de dos de los autores en Thinc [1], extendiendo la arquitectura del servidor e introduciendo una interfaz de cliente y un modelo de uso para admitir de manera eficiente los dispositivos PDA para aplicaciones web móviles. Otros enfoques para mejorar el rendimiento de la navegación web inalámbrica móvil se han centrado en usar proxies de transcodificación y almacenamiento en caché junto con el modelo de cliente FAT [11, 9, 4, 8]. Funcionan empujando la funcionalidad a proxies externos y utilizando aplicaciones de navegación especializadas en el dispositivo PDA que se comunican con el proxy. Nuestro enfoque de ThinClient difiere fundamentalmente de estos enfoques de cliente grasa al empujar toda la lógica del navegador web al servidor, aprovechando las inversiones existentes en los navegadores web de escritorio y las aplicaciones auxiliares para trabajar sin problemas con los sistemas de producción sin ninguna configuración proxy adicional o modificaciones de navegador web. Con el surgimiento de la navegación web en pequeños dispositivos de visualización, los sitios web se han rediseñado utilizando mecanismos como WAP y se han desarrollado navegadores web nativos especializados para adaptar las necesidades de estos dispositivos. Recientemente, Opera ha desarrollado el navegador web de Opera Mini [15], que utiliza un enfoque similar al modelo de cliente delgado para proporcionar acceso en varios dispositivos móviles que normalmente serían incapaces de ejecutar un navegador web. En lugar de requerir que el dispositivo procese páginas web, utiliza un servidor remoto para preprocesar la página antes de enviarlo al teléfono.6. Conclusiones Hemos introducido PTHINC, una arquitectura de cliente delgado para PDA inalámbricos.PTHINC proporciona mecanismos de arquitectura y usabilidad clave, como cambiar el tamaño de la pantalla del lado del servidor, la rotación de la pantalla junto al cliente utilizando técnicas de copia simple, soporte de video YUV y maximización del espacio de pantalla para mostrar actualizaciones y aprovechar los botones de control PDA existentes para elementos de interfaz de usuario.Pthinc admite transparentemente los navegadores de escritorio tradicionales y sus aplicaciones auxiliares en dispositivos PDA y máquinas de escritorio, proporcionando a los usuarios móviles acceso ubicuo a un entorno web consistente, personalizado y con todas las funciones en dispositivos heterogéneos. Hemos implementado PTHINC y medimos su rendimiento en las aplicaciones web en comparación con los sistemas existentes del cliente delgado y las aplicaciones web nativas. Nuestros resultados en múltiples dispositivos inalámbricos móviles demuestran que PTHINC ofrece un rendimiento de navegación web hasta 80 veces mejor que los sistemas de cliente delgado existentes, y 8 veces mejor que un navegador PDA nativo. Además, PTHINC es el único cliente delgado de PDA 151 Figura 11: Captura de pantalla de video: RDP 640x480 Figura 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figura 13: Captura de pantalla de video: ICA RESED 1024X768 Figura 14: Video de videos: PTHINC RESED 1024X768 que proporciona transparentemente a completo-Pantalla, reproducción de video de velocidad de fotograma completo, que hace sitios web con contenido multimedia accesible para usuarios web móviles.7.

        "pTHINC: A Thin-Client Architecture for Mobile Wireless Web Joeng Kim, Ricardo A. Baratto, and Jason Nieh Department of Computer Science Columbia University, New York, NY, USA {jk2438, ricardo, nieh}@cs.columbia.edu ABSTRACT Although web applications are gaining popularity on mobile wireless PDAs, web browsers on these systems can be quite slow and often lack adequate functionality to access many web sites.",
        "We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display.",
        "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and evaluated its performance on mobile wireless devices.",
        "Our results compared to local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.2.4 ComputerCommunication-Networks: Distributed Systems - client/ server General Terms: Design, Experimentation, Performance 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The increasing ubiquity of wireless networks and decreasing cost of hardware is fueling a proliferation of mobile wireless handheld devices, both as standalone wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) and popular integrated PDA/cell phone devices.",
        "These devices are enabling new forms of mobile computing and communication.",
        "Service providers are leveraging these devices to deliver pervasive web access, and mobile web users already often use these devices to access web-enabled information such as news, email, and localized travel guides and maps.",
        "It is likely that within a few years, most of the devices accessing the web will be mobile.",
        "Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.",
        "Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].",
        "As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.",
        "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
        "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
        "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
        "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
        "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
        "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
        "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
        "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",
        "The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.",
        "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",
        "Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.",
        "The thin-client model provides several important benefits for mobile wireless web.",
        "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
        "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
        "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
        "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
        "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
        "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
        "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
        "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
        "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
        "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
        "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
        "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
        "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
        "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",
        "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",
        "We have quantitatively evaluated pTHINC against local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches on Pocket PC devices.",
        "Our experimental results demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.",
        "This paper presents the design and implementation of pTHINC.",
        "Section 2 describes the overall usage model and usability characteristics of pTHINC.",
        "Section 3 presents the design and system architecture of pTHINC.",
        "Section 4 presents experimental results measuring the performance of pTHINC on web applications and comparing it against native PDA browsers and other popular PDA thin-client systems.",
        "Section 5 discusses related work.",
        "Finally, we present some concluding remarks. 2.",
        "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
        "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
        "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
        "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
        "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
        "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
        "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
        "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
        "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
        "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
        "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
        "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
        "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
        "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
        "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
        "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
        "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
        "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
        "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
        "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
        "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
        "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
        "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
        "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
        "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
        "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
        "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
        "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
        "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
        "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
        "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
        "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
        "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
        "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
        "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
        "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
        "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
        "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
        "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
        "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
        "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
        "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
        "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
        "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
        "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
        "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
        "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
        "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
        "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
        "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
        "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
        "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
        "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
        "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
        "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
        "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
        "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
        "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
        "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
        "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
        "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
        "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
        "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
        "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
        "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
        "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
        "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
        "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
        "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
        "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
        "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
        "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
        "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
        "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
        "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
        "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
        "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
        "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
        "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
        "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
        "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
        "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
        "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
        "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
        "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
        "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
        "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
        "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
        "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
        "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
        "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
        "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
        "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
        "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
        "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
        "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
        "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
        "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
        "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
        "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
        "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",
        "To demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting mobile wireless web applications, we have measured its performance on web applications.",
        "We present experimental results on different PDA devices for two popular web applications, browsing web pages and playing video content from the web.",
        "We compared pTHINC against native web applications running locally on the PDA to demonstrate the improvement that pTHINC can provide over the traditional fat-client approach.",
        "We also compared pTHINC against three of the most widely used thin clients that can run on PDAs, Citrix Meta-FrameXP [2], Microsoft Remote Desktop [3] and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) [16].",
        "We follow common practice and refer to Citrix MetaFrameXP and Microsoft Remote Desktop by their respective remote display protocols, ICA (Independent Computing Architecture) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). 4.1 Experimental Testbed We conducted our web experiments using two different wireless Pocket PC PDAs in an isolated Wi-Fi network testbed, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The testbed consisted of two PDA client devices, a packet monitor, a thin-client server, and a web server.",
        "Except for the PDAs, all of the other machines were IBM Netfinity 4500R servers with dual 933 MHz Intel PIII CPUs and 512 MB RAM and were connected on a switched 100 Mbps FastEthernet network.",

        "All experiments using the wireless network were conducted within ten feet of the access point, so we considered the amount of packet loss to be negligible in our experiments.",

        "The X51v has an Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator with 16MB video memory.",
        "Both PDAs are capable of 16-bit color but have different screen sizes and display resolutions.",
        "The X5 has a 3.5 inch diagonal screen with 240×320 resolution.",
        "The X51v has a 3.7 inch diagonal screen with 480×640.",
        "The four thin clients that we used support different levels of display quality as summarized in Table 2.",
        "The RDP client only supports a fixed 640×480 display resolution on the server with 8-bit color depth, while other platforms provide higher levels of display quality.",
        "To provide a fair comparison across all platforms, we conducted our experiments with thin-client sessions configured for two possible resolutions, 1024×768 and 640×480.",
        "Both ICA and VNC were configured to use the native PDA resolution of 16-bit color depth.",
        "The current pTHINC prototype uses 24-bit color directly and the client downsamples updates to the 16-bit color depth available on the PDA.",
        "RDP was configured using only 8-bit color depth since it does not support any better color depth.",
        "Since both pTHINC and ICA provide the ability to view the display resized to fit the screen, we measured both clients with and without the display resized to fit the PDA screen.",
        "Each thin client was tested using landscape rather than portrait mode when available.",
        "All systems run on the X51v could run in landscape mode because the hardware provides a landscape mode feature.",
        "However, the X5 does not provide this functionality.",
        "Only pTHINC directly supports landscape mode, so it was the only system that could run in landscape mode on both the X5 and X51v.",
        "To provide a fair comparison, we also standardized on common hardware and operating systems whenever possible.",
        "All of the systems used the Netfinity server as the thin-client server.",
        "For the two systems designed for Windows servers, ICA and RDP, we ran Windows 2003 Server on the server.",
        "For the other systems which support X-based servers, VNC and pTHINC, we ran the Debian Linux Unstable distribution with the Linux 2.6.10 kernel on the server.",
        "We used the latest thin-client server versions available on each platform at the time of our experiments, namely Citrix MetaFrame XP Server for Windows Feature Release 3, Microsoft Remote Desktop built into Windows XP and Windows 2003 using RDP 5.2, and VNC 4.0. 4.2 Application Benchmarks We used two web application benchmarks for our experiments based on two common application scenarios, browsing web pages and playing video content from the web.",
        "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
        "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",
        "To measure web browsing performance, we used a web browsing benchmark based on the Web Text Page Load Test from the Ziff-Davis i-Bench benchmark suite [7].",
        "The benchmark consists of JavaScript controlled load of 55 pages from the web server.",
        "The pages contain both text and graphics with pages varying in size.",
        "The graphics are embedded images in GIF and JPEG formats.",
        "The original i-Bench benchmark was modified for slow-motion benchmarking by introducing delays of several seconds between the pages using JavaScript.",
        "Then two tests were run, one where delays where added between each page, and one where pages where loaded continuously without waiting for them to be displayed on the client.",
        "In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages.",
        "We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10].",
        "The packet monitor also recorded the amount of data transmitted between the client and the server.",
        "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
        "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",
        "The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time.",
        "To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 running on the thin-client server for the thin clients, and Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile for 2003 and Mobile for 5.0 for the native browsers on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively.",
        "In all cases, the web browser used was sized to fill the entire display region available.",
        "To measure video playback performance, we used a video benchmark that consisted of playing a 34.75s MPEG-1 video clip containing a mix of news and entertainment programming at full-screen resolution.",
        "The video clip is 5.11 MB and consists of 834 352x240 pixel frames with an ideal frame rate of 24 frames/sec.",
        "We measured video performance using slow-motion benchmarking by monitoring resulting packet traffic at two playback rates, 1 frames/second (fps) and 24 fps, and comparing the results to determine playback delays and frame drops that occur at 24 fps to measure overall video quality [13].",
        "For example, 100% quality means that all video frames were played at real-time speed.",
        "On the other hand, 50% quality could mean that half the video data was dropped, or that the clip took twice as long to play even though all of the video data was displayed.",
        "To run the video benchmark, we used Windows Media Player 9 for Windows-based thin-client servers, MPlayer 1.0 pre 6 for X-based thin-client servers, and Windows Media Player 9 Mobile and 10 Mobile for the native video players running locally on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively.",

        "The measurements show that only the thin clients deliver subsecond web page latencies.",
        "In contrast, the local browser requires more than 3 seconds on average per web page.",
        "The local browser performs worse since it needs to run a more limited web browser to process the HTML, JavaScript, and do all the rendering using the limited capabilities of the PDA.",
        "The thin clients can take advantage of faster server hardware and a highly tuned web browser to process the web content much faster.",
        "Figure 3 shows that RDP is the next fastest platform after pTHINC.",
        "However, RDP is only able to run at a fixed resolution of 640×480 and 8-bit color depth.",
        "Furthermore, RDP also clips the display to the size of the PDA screen so that it does not need to send updates that are not visible on the PDA screen.",
        "This provides a performance benefit assuming the remaining web content is not viewed, but degrades performance when a user scrolls around the display to view other web content.",
        "RDP achieves its performance with significantly lower display quality compared to the other thin clients and with additional display clipping not used by other systems.",
        "As a result, RDP performance alone does not provide a complete comparison with the other platforms.",
        "In contrast, pTHINC provides the fastest performance while at the same time providing equal or better display quality than the other systems. 0 1 10 100 1000 pTHINC Resized pTHINCICA Resized ICAVNCRDPLOCAL DataSize(KB) Platform Axim X5 (640x480 or less) Axim X51v (640x480) Axim X5 (1024x768) Axim X51v (1024x768) Figure 4: Browsing Benchmark: Average Page Data Transferred Since VNC and ICA provide similar display quality to pTHINC, these systems provide a more fair comparison of different thin-client approaches.",
        "ICA performs worse in part because it uses higher-level display primitives that require additional client processing costs.",
        "VNC performs worse in part because it loses display data due to its client-pull delivery mechanism and because of the client processing costs in decompressing raw pixel primitives.",
        "In both cases, their performance was limited in part because their PDA clients were unable to keep up with the rate at which web pages were being displayed.",
        "Figure 3 also shows measurements for those thin clients that support resizing the display to fit the PDA screen, namely ICA and pTHINC.",
        "Resizing requires additional processing, which results in slower average web page latencies.",

        "ICA performs resizing on the slower PDA client.",
        "In contrast, pTHINC leverage the more powerful server to do resizing, reducing the performance difference between resizing and not resizing.",
        "Unlike ICA, pTHINC is able to provide subsecond web page download latencies in both cases.",
        "Figure 4 shows the data transferred in KB per page when running the slow-motion version of the tests.",
        "All of the platforms have modest data transfer requirements of roughly 100 KB per page or less.",
        "This is well within the bandwidth capacity of Wi-Fi networks.",
        "The measurements show that the local browser does not transfer the least amount of data.",
        "This is surprising as HTML is often considered to be a very compact representation of content.",
        "Instead, RDP is the most bandwidth efficient platform, largely as a result of using only 8-bit color depth and screen clipping so that it does not transfer the entire web page to the client. pTHINC overall has the largest data requirements, slightly more than VNC.",
        "This is largely a result of the current pTHINC prototypes lack of native support for 16-bit color data in the wire protocol.",
        "However, this result also highlights pTHINCs performance as it is faster than all other systems even while transferring more data.",
        "Furthermore, as newer PDA models support full 24-bit color, these results indicate that pTHINC will continue to provide good web browsing performance.",
        "Since display usability and quality are as important as performance, Figures 5 to 8 compare screenshots of the different thin clients when displaying a web page, in this case from the popular BBC news website.",

        "Figure 6 shows that VNC makes better use of the screen space and provides better display quality, but still forces the user to scroll around to view the web page due to its lack of resizing support.",
        "Figure 7 shows ICAs ability to display the full web page given its resizing support, but that its lack of landscape capability and poorer resize algorithm significantly compromise display quality.",
        "In contrast, Figure 8 shows pTHINC using resizing to provide a high quality fullscreen display of the full width of the web page. pTHINC maximizes the entire viewing region by moving all controls to the PDA buttons.",

        "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
        "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
        "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
        "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
        "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
        "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
        "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
        "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
        "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
        "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
        "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
        "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
        "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
        "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
        "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
        "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
        "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
        "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
        "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

Baratto, and Jason Nieh Department of Computer Science Columbia University, New York, NY, USA {jk2438, ricardo, nieh}@cs.columbia.edu ABSTRACT Although web applications are gaining popularity on mobile wireless PDAs, web browsers on these systems can be quite slow and often lack adequate functionality to access many web sites.",
                "We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and evaluated its performance on mobile wireless devices.",

                "Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.",
                "Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].",
                "As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.",
                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",
                "The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.",
                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",

                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",

                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",

                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for <br>mobile wireless pda</br> users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",

                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",

                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",

                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a <br>web browser</br> and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a <br>web browser</br> installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same <br>web browser</br> environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their <br>web browser</br> and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all <br>web browser</br> logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or <br>web browser</br> modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] <br>web browser</br>, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a <br>web browser</br>.",

                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater <br>functionality</br> and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser <br>functionality</br>.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",
                "The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.",
                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",

                "The thin-client model provides several important benefits for mobile wireless web.",
                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater <br>functionality</br> and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",

                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control <br>functionality</br> from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of <br>functionality</br> on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this <br>functionality</br> in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little <br>functionality</br> on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",

                "The testbed consisted of two PDA client devices, a packet monitor, a thin-client server, and a web server.",
                "Except for the PDAs, all of the other machines were IBM Netfinity 4500R servers with dual 933 MHz Intel PIII CPUs and 512 MB RAM and were connected on a switched 100 Mbps FastEthernet network.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing <br>functionality</br>.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",

                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",
                "Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.",

                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed <br>pthinc</br> (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). <br>pthinc</br> builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables <br>pthinc</br> to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, <br>pthinc</br> can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, <br>pthinc</br> maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",

                "<br>pthinc</br> USAGE MODEL <br>pthinc</br> is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the <br>pthinc</br> PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. <br>pthinc</br> first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, <br>pthinc</br> presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, <br>pthinc</br> provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, <br>pthinc</br> allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. <br>pthinc</br> addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, <br>pthinc</br> can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, <br>pthinc</br> must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, <br>pthinc</br> provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: <br>pthinc</br> shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, <br>pthinc</br> will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. <br>pthinc</br> provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, <br>pthinc</br> must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, <br>pthinc</br> provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for <br>pthinc</br> users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, <br>pthinc</br> runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, <br>pthinc</br> reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by <br>pthinc</br> do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the <br>pthinc</br> client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how <br>pthinc</br> utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. <br>pthinc</br> provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the <br>pthinc</br> session. <br>pthinc</br> uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. <br>pthinc</br> provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, <br>pthinc</br> leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "<br>pthinc</br> SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE <br>pthinc</br> builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. <br>pthinc</br> accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, <br>pthinc</br> can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",

                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. <br>pthinc</br> prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",

                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. <br>pthinc</br> uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",

                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, <br>pthinc</br> provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. <br>pthinc</br> display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, <br>pthinc</br> simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",

                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the <br>pthinc</br> client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",

                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. <br>pthinc</br> takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, <br>pthinc</br> uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, <br>pthinc</br> is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, <br>pthinc</br> uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing <br>pthinc</br> to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how <br>pthinc</br> leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, <br>pthinc</br> creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, <br>pthinc</br> has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",

                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",

                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",

                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",

                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",

                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",
                "The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time.",
                "To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 running on the thin-client server for the thin clients, and Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile for 2003 and Mobile for 5.0 for the native browsers on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",

                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",
                "To demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting mobile wireless web applications, we have measured its performance on web applications.",
                "We present experimental results on different PDA devices for two popular web applications, browsing web pages and playing video content from the web.",
                "We compared pTHINC against native web applications running locally on the PDA to demonstrate the improvement that pTHINC can provide over the traditional fat-client approach.",
                "We also compared pTHINC against three of the most widely used thin clients that can run on PDAs, Citrix Meta-FrameXP [2], Microsoft Remote Desktop [3] and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) [16].",
                "We follow common practice and refer to Citrix MetaFrameXP and Microsoft Remote Desktop by their respective remote display protocols, ICA (Independent Computing Architecture) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). 4.1 Experimental Testbed We conducted our web experiments using two different wireless Pocket PC PDAs in an isolated Wi-Fi network testbed, as shown in Figure 2.",
                "The testbed consisted of two PDA client devices, a packet monitor, a thin-client server, and a web server.",
                "Except for the PDAs, all of the other machines were IBM Netfinity 4500R servers with dual 933 MHz Intel PIII CPUs and 512 MB RAM and were connected on a switched 100 Mbps FastEthernet network.",

                "Both ICA and VNC were configured to use the native PDA resolution of 16-bit color depth.",
                "The current pTHINC prototype uses 24-bit color directly and the client downsamples updates to the 16-bit color depth available on the PDA.",
                "RDP was configured using only 8-bit color depth since it does not support any better color depth.",
                "Since both pTHINC and ICA provide the ability to view the display resized to fit the screen, we measured both clients with and without the display resized to fit the PDA screen.",
                "Each thin client was tested using landscape rather than portrait mode when available.",
                "All systems run on the X51v could run in landscape mode because the hardware provides a landscape mode feature.",
                "However, the X5 does not provide this functionality.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",
                "To measure web browsing performance, we used a web browsing benchmark based on the Web Text Page Load Test from the Ziff-Davis i-Bench benchmark suite [7].",
                "The benchmark consists of JavaScript controlled load of 55 pages from the web server.",
                "The pages contain both text and graphics with pages varying in size.",
                "The graphics are embedded images in GIF and JPEG formats.",
                "The original i-Bench benchmark was modified for slow-motion benchmarking by introducing delays of several seconds between the pages using JavaScript.",
                "Then two tests were run, one where delays where added between each page, and one where pages where loaded continuously without waiting for them to be displayed on the client.",
                "In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages.",
                "We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10].",
                "The packet monitor also recorded the amount of data transmitted between the client and the server.",
                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",
                "The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time.",
                "To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 running on the thin-client server for the thin clients, and Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile for 2003 and Mobile for 5.0 for the native browsers on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively.",
                "In all cases, the web browser used was sized to fill the entire display region available.",

                "For example, 100% quality means that all video frames were played at real-time speed.",
                "On the other hand, 50% quality could mean that half the video data was dropped, or that the clip took twice as long to play even though all of the video data was displayed.",

                "Figure 5 shows that RDP does not support fullscreen mode and wastes lots of screen space for controls and UI elements, requiring the user to scroll around in order to access the full contents of the web browsing session.",
                "Figure 6 shows that VNC makes better use of the screen space and provides better display quality, but still forces the user to scroll around to view the web page due to its lack of resizing support.",
                "Figure 7 shows ICAs ability to display the full web page given its resizing support, but that its lack of landscape capability and poorer resize algorithm significantly compromise display quality.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",

                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a <br>thin-client</br> system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other <br>thin-client</br> systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a <br>thin-client</br> system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other <br>thin-client</br> approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",

                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",

                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",

                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between <br>thin-client</br> usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.",
                "Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].",
                "As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.",
                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",

                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",
                "Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.",

                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",

                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",

                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve <br>web browsing performance</br> on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster <br>web browsing performance</br> and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 <br>video playback</br> Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient <br>video playback</br>, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support <br>video playback</br>.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen <br>video playback</br> without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide <br>video playback</br> in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support <br>video playback</br> can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once <br>video playback</br> is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",

Baratto, and Jason Nieh Department of Computer Science Columbia University, New York, NY, USA {jk2438, ricardo, nieh}@cs.columbia.edu ABSTRACT Although web applications are gaining popularity on mobile wireless PDAs, web browsers on these systems can be quite slow and often lack adequate functionality to access many web sites.",
                "We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and evaluated its performance on mobile wireless devices.",
                "Our results compared to local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports <br>crucial browser helper application</br>s such as video playback.",

                "Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.",
                "Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].",
                "As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.",
                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",
                "The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.",
                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",
                "Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.",
                "The thin-client model provides several important benefits for mobile wireless web.",
                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",

                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",
                "The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time.",
                "To run the web browsing benchmark, we used Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4 running on the thin-client server for the thin clients, and Windows Internet Explorer (IE) Mobile for 2003 and Mobile for 5.0 for the native browsers on the X5 and X51v PDAs, respectively.",

                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",

                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",

                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with <br>seamless mobility</br> across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",

                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",

                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving <br>system usability</br>.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",
                "We have quantitatively evaluated pTHINC against local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches on Pocket PC devices.",
                "Our experimental results demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",

                "In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages.",
                "We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10].",

                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",

                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

Baratto, and Jason Nieh Department of Computer Science Columbia University, New York, NY, USA {jk2438, ricardo, nieh}@cs.columbia.edu ABSTRACT Although web applications are gaining popularity on mobile wireless PDAs, web browsers on these systems can be quite slow and often lack adequate functionality to access many web sites.",
                "We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available <br>screen resolution</br> for application display.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and evaluated its performance on mobile wireless devices.",
                "Our results compared to local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.",

                "Service providers are leveraging these devices to deliver pervasive web access, and mobile web users already often use these devices to access web-enabled information such as news, email, and localized travel guides and maps.",
                "It is likely that within a few years, most of the devices accessing the web will be mobile.",
                "Users typically access web content by running a web browser and associated helper applications locally on the PDA.",
                "Although native web browsers exist for PDAs, they deliver subpar performance and have a much smaller feature set and more limited functionality than their desktop computing counterparts [10].",
                "As a result, PDA web browsers are often not able to display web content from web sites that leverage more advanced web technologies to deliver a richer web experience.",
                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",
                "Thin-client computing provides an alternative approach for enabling pervasive web access from handheld devices.",
                "A thin-client computing system consists of a server and a client that communicate over a network using a remote display protocol.",
                "The protocol enables graphical displays to be virtualized and served across a network to a client device, while application logic is executed on the server.",
                "Using the remote display protocol, the client transmits user input to the server, and the server returns screen updates of the applications from the server to the client.",
                "Using a thin-client model for mobile handheld devices, PDAs can become simple stateless clients that leverage the remote server capabilities to execute web browsers and other helper applications.",
                "The thin-client model provides several important benefits for mobile wireless web.",
                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",

                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",

                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",

                "In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages.",
                "We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10].",

                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",

                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",

                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",

                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",

                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] <br>remote display</br> architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the <br>remote display</br> server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",

                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",

                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",

                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "First, standard desktop web applications can be used to deliver web content to PDAs without rewriting or adapting applications to execute on a PDA, reducing development costs and leveraging existing software investments.",
                "Second, complex web applications can be executed on powerful servers instead of running stripped down versions on more resource constrained PDAs, providing greater functionality and better performance [10].",
                "Third, web applications can take advantage of servers with faster networks and better connectivity, further boosting application performance.",
                "Fourth, PDAs can be even simpler devices since they do not need to perform complex application logic, potentially reducing energy consumption and extend143 ing battery life.",
                "Finally, PDA thin clients can be essentially stateless appliances that do not need to be backed up or restored, require almost no maintenance or upgrades, and do not store any sensitive data that can be lost or stolen.",
                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless <br>mobility</br> across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC on Windows Mobile and demonstrated that it works transparently with existing applications, window systems, and operating systems, and does not require modifying, recompiling, or relinking existing software.",
                "We have quantitatively evaluated pTHINC against local PDA web browsers and other thin-client approaches on Pocket PC devices.",
                "Our experimental results demonstrate that pTHINC provides superior web browsing performance and is the only PDA thin client that effectively supports crucial browser helper applications such as video playback.",
                "This paper presents the design and implementation of pTHINC.",
                "Section 2 describes the overall usage model and usability characteristics of pTHINC.",

                "Finally, we present some concluding remarks. 2.",
                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless <br>mobility</br> across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have implemented a pTHINC prototype that runs the client on widely-used Windows Mobile-based Pocket PC devices and the server on both Windows and Linux operating systems.",

                "The testbed consisted of two PDA client devices, a packet monitor, a thin-client server, and a web server.",
                "Except for the PDAs, all of the other machines were IBM Netfinity 4500R servers with dual 933 MHz Intel PIII CPUs and 512 MB RAM and were connected on a switched 100 Mbps FastEthernet network.",

                "RDP was configured using only 8-bit color depth since it does not support any better color depth.",
                "Since both pTHINC and ICA provide the ability to view the display resized to fit the screen, we measured both clients with and without the display resized to fit the PDA screen.",

                "Since many thin-client systems including two of the ones tested are closed and proprietary, we measured their performance in a noninvasive manner by capturing network traffic with a packet monitor and using a variant of slow-motion benchmarking [13] previously developed to measure thin-client performance in PDA environments [10].",
                "This measurement methodology accounts for both the display decoupling that can occur between client and server in thin-client systems as well as client processing time, which may be significant in the case of PDAs.",

                "In the first test, delays were sufficiently adjusted in each case to ensure that each page could be received and displayed on the client completely without temporal overlap in transferring the data belonging to two consecutive pages.",
                "We used the packet monitor to record the packet traffic for each run of the benchmark, then used the timestamps of the first and last packet in the trace to obtain our latency measures [10].",
                "The packet monitor also recorded the amount of data transmitted between the client and the server.",
                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",
                "The product of the scale factor with the latency measurement produces the true latency accounting for client processing time.",

                "For example, 100% quality means that all video frames were played at real-time speed.",
                "On the other hand, 50% quality could mean that half the video data was dropped, or that the clip took twice as long to play even though all of the video data was displayed.",

                "RELATED WORK Several studies have examined the web browsing performance of thin-client computing [13, 19, 10].",
                "The ability for thin clients to improve web browsing performance on wireless PDAs was first quantitatively demonstrated in a previous study by one of the authors [10].",
                "This study demonstrated that thin clients can provide both faster web browsing performance and greater web browsing functionality.",
                "The study considered a wide range of web content including content from medical information systems.",
                "Our work builds on this previous study and consider important issues such as how usable existing thin clients are in PDA environments, the trade-offs between thin-client usability and performance, performance across different PDA devices, and the performance of thin clients on common web-related applications such as video.",
                "Many thin clients have been developed and some have PDA clients, including Microsofts Remote Desktop [3], Citrix MetraFrame XP [2], Virtual Network Computing [16, 12], GoToMyPC [5], and Tarantella [18].",
                "These systems were first designed for desktop computing and retrofitted for PDAs.",
                "Unlike pTHINC, they do not address key system architecture and usability issues important for PDAs.",
                "This limits their display quality, system performance, available screen space, and overall usability on PDAs. pTHINC builds on previous work by two of the authors on THINC [1], extending the server architecture and introducing a client interface and usage model to efficiently support PDA devices for mobile web applications.",
                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",

                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",

                "We have developed pTHINC, a PDA thinclient solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function web browsers and other application logic, then sends simple screen updates to the PDA for display. pTHINC uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes. pTHINC also leverages existing PDA control buttons to improve system usability and maximize available screen resolution for application display.",

                "This fundamental problem arises for two reasons.",
                "First, because PDAs have a completely different hardware/software environment from traditional desktop computers, web applications need to be rewritten and customized for PDAs if at all possible, duplicating development costs.",
                "Because the desktop application market is larger and more mature, most development effort generally ends up being spent on desktop applications, resulting in greater functionality and performance than their PDA counterparts.",
                "Second, PDAs have a more resource constrained environment than traditional desktop computers to provide a smaller form factor and longer battery life.",
                "Desktop web browsers are large, complex applications that are unable to run on a PDA.",
                "Instead, developers are forced to significantly strip down these web browsers to provide a usable PDA web browser, thereby crippling PDA browser functionality.",

                "This model provides a viable avenue for medical organizations to comply with HIPAA regulations [6] while embracing mobile handhelds in their day to day operations.",
                "Despite these potential advantages, thin clients have been unable to provide the full range of these benefits in delivering web applications to mobile handheld devices.",
                "Existing thin clients were not designed for PDAs and do not account for important usability issues in the context of small form factor devices, resulting in difficulty in navigating displayed web content.",
                "Furthermore, existing thin clients are ineffective at providing seamless mobility across the heterogeneous mix of device display sizes and resolutions.",
                "While existing thin clients can already provide faster performance than native PDA web browsers in delivering HTML web content, they do not effectively support more display-intensive web helper applications such as multimedia video, which is increasingly an integral part of available web content.",
                "To harness the full potential of thin-client computing in providing mobile wireless web on PDAs, we have developed pTHINC (PDA THin-client InterNet Computing). pTHINC builds on our previous work on THINC [1] to provide a thinclient architecture for mobile handheld devices. pTHINC virtualizes and resizes the display on the server to efficiently deliver high-fidelity screen updates to a broad range of different clients, screen sizes, and screen orientations, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.",
                "This enables pTHINC to provide the same persistent web session across different client devices.",
                "For example, pTHINC can provide the same web browsing session appropriately scaled for display on a desktop computer and a PDA so that the same cookies, bookmarks, and other meta-data are continuously available on both machines simultaneously. pTHINCs virtual display approach leverages semantic information available in display commands, and client-side video hardware to provide more efficient remote display mechanisms that are crucial for supporting more display-intensive web applications.",
                "Given limited display resolution on PDAs, pTHINC maximizes the use of screen real estate for remote display by moving control functionality from the screen to readily available PDA control buttons, improving system usability.",

                "PTHINC USAGE MODEL pTHINC is a thin-client system that consists of a simple client viewer application that runs on the PDA and a server that runs on a commodity PC.",
                "The server leverages more powerful PCs to to run web browsers and other application logic.",
                "The client takes user input from the PDA stylus and virtual keyboard and sends them to the server to pass to the applications.",
                "Screen updates are then sent back from the server to the client for display to the user.",
                "When the pTHINC PDA client is started, the user is presented with a simple graphical interface where information such as server address and port, user authentication information, and session settings can be provided. pTHINC first attempts to connect to the server and perform the necessary handshaking.",
                "Once this process has been completed, pTHINC presents the user with the most recent display of his session.",
                "If the session does not exist, a new session is created.",
                "Existing sessions can be seamlessly continued without changes in the session setting or server configuration.",
                "Unlike other thin-client systems, pTHINC provides a user with a persistent web session model in which a user can launch a session running a web browser and associated applications at the server, then disconnect from that session and reconnect to it again anytime.",
                "When a user reconnects to the session, all of the applications continue running where the user left off, so that the user can continue working as though he or she never disconnected.",
                "The ability to disconnect and reconnect to a session at anytime is an important benefit for mobile wireless PDA users which may have intermittent network connectivity. pTHINCs persistent web session model enables a user to reconnect to a web session from devices other than the one on which the web session was originally initiated.",
                "This provides users with seamless mobility across different devices.",
                "If a user loses his PDA, he can easily use another PDA to access his web session.",
                "Furthermore, pTHINC allows users to use non-PDA devices to access web sessions as well.",
                "A user can access the same persistent web session on a desktop PC as on a PDA, enabling a user to use the same web session from any computer. pTHINCs persistent web session model addresses a key problem encountered by mobile web users, the lack of a common web environment across computers.",
                "Web browsers often store important information such as bookmarks, cookies, and history, which enable them to function in a much more useful manner.",
                "The problem that occurs when a user moves between computers is that this data, which is specific to a web browser installation, cannot move with the user.",
                "Furthermore, web browsers often need helper applications to process different media content, and those applications may not be consistently available across all computers. pTHINC addresses this problem by enabling a user to remotely use the exact same web browser environment and helper applications from any computer.",
                "As a result, pTHINC can provide a common, consistent web browsing environment for mobile users across different devices without requiring them to attempt to repeatedly synchronize different web browsing environments across multiple machines.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must provide mechanisms to support different display sizes and resolutions.",
                "Toward this end, pTHINC provides a zoom feature that enables a user to zoom in and out of a display and allows the display of a web 144 Figure 1: pTHINC shortcut keys session to be resized to fit the screen of the device being used.",
                "For example, if the server is running a web session at 1024×768 but the client is a PDA with a display resolution of 640×480, pTHINC will resize the desktop display to fit the full display in the smaller screen of the PDA. pTHINC provides the PDA user with the option to increase the size of the display by zooming in to different parts of the display.",
                "Users are often familiar with the general layout of commonly visited websites, and are able to leverage this resizing feature to better navigate through web pages.",
                "For example, a user can zoom out of the display to view the entire page content and navigate hyperlinks, then zoom in to a region of interest for a better view.",
                "To enable a user to access the same web session on different devices, pTHINC must also provide mechanisms to support different display orientations.",
                "In a desktop environment, users are typically accustomed to having displays presented in landscape mode where the screen width is larger than its height.",
                "However, in a PDA environment, the choice is not always obvious.",
                "Some users may prefer having the display in portrait mode, as it is easier to hold the device in their hands, while others may prefer landscape mode in order to minimize the amount of side-scrolling necessary to view a web page.",
                "To accommodate PDA user preferences, pTHINC provides an orientation feature that enables it to seamless rotate the display between landscape and portrait mode.",
                "The landscape mode is particularly useful for pTHINC users who frequently access their web sessions on both desktop and PDA devices, providing those users with the same familiar landscape setting across different devices.",
                "Because screen space is a relatively scarce resource on PDAs, pTHINC runs in fullscreen mode to maximize the screen area available to display the web session.",
                "To be able to use all of the screen on the PDA and still allow the user to control and interact with it, pTHINC reuses the typical shortcut buttons found on PDAs to perform all the control functions available to the user.",
                "The buttons used by pTHINC do not require any OS environment changes; they are simply intercepted by the pTHINC client application when they are pressed.",
                "Figure 1 shows how pTHINC utilizes the shortcut buttons to provide easy navigation and improve the overall user experience.",
                "These buttons are not device specific, and the layout shown is common to widelyused PocketPC devices. pTHINC provides six shortcuts to support its usage model: • Rotate Screen: The record button on the left edge is used to rotate the screen between portrait and landscape mode each time the button is pressed. • Zoom Out: The leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom out the display of the web session providing a birds eye view of the web session. • Zoom In: The second leftmost button on the bottom front is used to zoom in the display of the web session to more clearly view content of interest. • Directional Scroll: The middle button on the bottom front is used to scroll around the display using a single control button in a way that is already familiar to PDA users.",
                "This feature is particularly useful when the user has zoomed in to a region of the display such that only part of the display is visible on the screen. • Show/Hide Keyboard: The second rightmost button on the bottom front is used to bring up a virtual keyboard drawn on the screen for devices which have no physical keyboard.",
                "The virtual keyboard uses standard PDA OS mechanisms, providing portability across different PDA environments. • Close Session: The rightmost button on the bottom front is used to disconnect from the pTHINC session. pTHINC uses the PDA touch screen, stylus, and standard user interface mechanisms to provide a user interface pointand-click metaphor similar to that provided by the mouse in a traditional desktop computing environment. pTHINC does not use a cursor since PDA environments do not provide one.",
                "Instead, a user can use the stylus to tap on different sections of the touch screen to indicate input focus.",
                "A single tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding single click mouse event.",
                "A double tap on the touch screen generates a corresponding double click mouse event. pTHINC provides two-button mouse emulation by using the stylus to press down on the screen for one second to generate a right mouse click.",
                "All of these actions are identical to the way users already interact with PDA applications in the common PocketPC environment.",
                "In web browsing, users can click on hyperlinks and focus on input boxes by simply tapping on the desired screen area of interest.",
                "Unlike local PDA web browsers and other PDA applications, pTHINC leverages more powerful desktop user interface metaphors to enable users to manipulate multiple open application windows instead of being limited to a single application window at any given moment.",
                "This provides increased browsing flexibility beyond what is currently available on PDA devices.",
                "Similar to a desktop environment, browser windows and other application windows can be moved around by pressing down and dragging the stylus similar to a mouse. 3.",
                "PTHINC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE pTHINC builds on the THINC [1] remote display architecture to provide a thin-client system for PDAs. pTHINC virtualizes the display at the server by leveraging the video device abstraction layer, which sits below the window server and above the framebuffer.",
                "This is a well-defined, low-level, device-dependent layer that exposes the video hardware to the display system. pTHINC accomplishes this through a simple virtual display driver that intercepts drawing commands, packetizes, and sends them over the network. 145 While other thin-client approaches intercept display commands at other layers of the display subsystem, pTHINCs display virtualization approach provides some key benefits in efficiently supporting PDA clients.",
                "For example, intercepting display commands at a higher layer between applications and the window system as is done by X [17] requires replicating and running a great deal of functionality on the PDA that is traditionally provided by the desktop window system.",
                "Given both the size and complexity of traditional window systems, attempting to replicate this functionality in the restricted PDA environment would have proven to be a daunting, and perhaps unfeasible task.",
                "Furthermore, applications and the window system often require tight synchronization in their operation and imposing a wireless network between them by running the applications on the server and the window system on the client would significantly degrade performance.",
                "On the other hand, intercepting at a lower layer by extracting pixels out of the framebuffer as they are rendered provides a simple solution that requires very little functionality on the PDA client, but can also result in degraded performance.",
                "The reason is that by the time the remote display server attempts to send screen updates, it has lost all semantic information that may have helped it encode efficiently, and it must resort to using a generic and expensive encoding mechanism on the server, as well as a potentially expensive decoding mechanism on the limited PDA client.",
                "In contrast to both the high and low level interception approaches, pTHINCs approach of intercepting at the device driver provides an effective balance between client and server simplicity, and the ability to efficiently encode and decode screen updates.",
                "By using a low-level virtual display approach, pTHINC can efficiently encode application display commands using only a small set of low-level commands.",
                "In a PDA environment, this set of commands provides a crucial component in maintaining the simplicity of the client in the resourceconstrained PDA environment.",
                "The display commands are shown in Table 1, and work as follows.",
                "COPY instructs the client to copy a region of the screen from its local framebuffer to another location.",
                "This command improves the user experience by accelerating scrolling and opaque window movement without having to resend screen data from the server.",
                "SFILL, PFILL, and BITMAP are commands that paint a fixed-size region on the screen.",
                "They are useful for accelerating the display of solid window backgrounds, desktop patterns, backgrounds of web pages, text drawing, and certain operations in graphics manipulation programs.",
                "SFILL fills a sizable region on the screen with a single color.",
                "PFILL replicates a tile over a screen region.",
                "BITMAP performs a fill using a bitmap of ones and zeros as a stipple to apply a foreground and background color.",
                "Finally, RAW is used to transmit unencoded pixel data to be displayed verbatim on a region of the screen.",
                "This command is invoked as a last resort if the server is unable to employ any other command, and it is the only command that may be compressed to mitigate its impact on network bandwidth. pTHINC delivers its commands using a non-blocking, serverpush update mechanism, where as soon as display updates are generated on the server, they are sent to the client.",
                "Clients are not required to explicitly request display updates, thus minimizing the impact that the typical varying network latency of wireless links may have on the responsiveness of the system.",
                "Keeping in mind that resource Command Description COPY Copy a frame buffer area to specified coordinates SFILL Fill an area with a given pixel color value PFILL Tile an area with a given pixel pattern BITMAP Fill a region using a bit pattern RAW Display raw pixel data at a given location Table 1: pTHINC Protocol Display Commands constrained PDAs and wireless networks may not be able to keep up with a fast server generating a large number of updates, pTHINC is able to coalesce, clip, and discard updates automatically if network loss or congestion occurs, or the client cannot keep up with the rate of updates.",
                "This type of behavior proves crucial in a web browsing environment, where for example, a page may be redrawn multiple times as it is rendered on the fly by the browser.",
                "In this case, the PDA will only receive and render the final result, which clearly is all the user is interesting in seeing. pTHINC prioritizes the delivery of updates to the PDA using a Shortest-Remaining-Size-First (SRSF) preemptive update scheduler.",
                "SRSF is analogous to Shortest-RemainingProcessing-Time scheduling, which is known to be optimal for minimizing mean response time in an interactive system.",
                "In a web browsing environment, short jobs are associated with text and basic page layout components such as the pages background, which are critical web content for the user.",
                "On the other hand, large jobs are often lower priority beautifying elements, or, even worse, web page banners and advertisements, which are of questionable value to the user as he or she is browsing the page.",
                "Using SRSF, pTHINC is able to maximize the utilization of the relatively scarce bandwidth available on the wireless connection between the PDA and the server. 3.1 Display Management To enable users to just as easily access their web browser and helper applications from a desktop computer at home as from a PDA while on the road, pTHINC provides a resize mechanism to zoom in and out of the display of a web session. pTHINC resizing is completely supported by the server, not the client.",
                "The server resamples updates to fit within the PDAs viewport before they are transmitted over the network. pTHINC uses Fants resampling algorithm to resize pixel updates.",
                "This provides smooth, visually pleasing updates with properly antialiasing and has only modest computational requirements. pTHINCs resizing approach has a number of advantages.",
                "First, it allows the PDA to leverage the vastly superior computational power of the server to use high quality resampling algorithms and produce higher quality updates for the PDA to display.",
                "Second, resizing the screen does not translate into additional resource requirements for the PDA, since it does not need to perform any additional work.",
                "Finally, better utilization of the wireless network is attained since rescaling the updates reduces their bandwidth requirements.",
                "To enable users to orient their displays on a PDA to provide a viewing experience that best accommodates user preferences and the layout of web pages or applications, pTHINC provides a display rotation mechanism to switch between landscape and portrait viewing modes. pTHINC display rotation is completely supported by the client, not the server. pTHINC does not explicitly recalculate the ge146 ometry of display updates to perform rotation, which would be computationally expensive.",
                "Instead, pTHINC simply changes the way data is copied into the framebuffer to switch between display modes.",
                "When in portrait mode, data is copied along the rows of the framebuffer from left to right.",
                "When in landscape mode, data is copied along the columns of the framebuffer from top to bottom.",
                "These very fast and simple techniques replace one set of copy operations with another and impose no performance overhead. pTHINC provides its own rotation mechanism to support a wide range of devices without imposing additional feature requirements on the PDA.",
                "Although some newer PDA devices provide native support for different orientations, this mechanism is not dynamic and requires the user to rotate the PDAs entire user interface before starting the pTHINC client.",
                "Windows Mobile provides native API mechanisms for PDA applications to rotate their UI on the fly, but these mechanisms deliver poor performance and display quality as the rotation is performed naively and is not completely accurate. 3.2 Video Playback Video has gradually become an integral part of the World Wide Web, and its presence will only continue to increase.",
                "Web sites today not only use animated graphics and flash to deliver web content in an attractive manner, but also utilize streaming video to enrich the web interface.",
                "Users are able to view pre-recorded and live newscasts on CNN, watch sports highlights on ESPN, and even search through large collection of videos on Google Video.",
                "To allow applications to provide efficient video playback, interfaces have been created in display systems that allow video device drivers to expose their hardware capabilities back to the applications. pTHINC takes advantage of these interfaces and its virtual device driver approach to provide a virtual bridge between the remote client and its hardware and the applications, and transparently support video playback.",
                "On top of this architecture, pTHINC uses the YUV colorspace to encode the video content, which provides a number of benefits.",
                "First, it has become increasingly common for PDA video hardware to natively support YUV and be able to perform the colorspace conversion and scaling automatically.",
                "As a result, pTHINC is able to provide fullscreen video playback without any performance hits.",
                "Second, the use of YUV allows for a more efficient representation of RGB data without loss of quality, by taking advantage of the human eyes ability to better distinguish differences in brightness than in color.",
                "In particular, pTHINC uses the YV12 format, which allows full color RGB data to be encoded using just 12 bits per pixel.",
                "Third, YUV data is produced as one of the last steps of the decoding process of most video codecs, allowing pTHINC to provide video playback in a manner that is format independent.",
                "Finally, even if the PDAs video hardware is unable to accelerate playback, the colorspace conversion process is simple enough that it does not impose unreasonable requirements on the PDA.",
                "A more concrete example of how pTHINC leverages the PDA video hardware to support video playback can be seen in our prototype implementation on the popular Dell Axim X51v PDA, which is equipped with the Intel 2700G multimedia accelerator.",
                "In this case, pTHINC creates an offscreen buffer in video memory and writes and reads from this memory region data on the YV12 format.",
                "When a new video frame arrives, video data is copied from the buffer to Figure 2: Experimental Testbed an overlay surface in video memory, which is independent of the normal surface used for traditional drawing.",
                "As the YV12 data is put onto the overlay, the Intel accelerator automatically performs both colorspace conversion and scaling.",
                "By using the overlay surface, pTHINC has no need to redraw the screen once video playback is over since the overlapped surface is unaffected.",
                "In addition, specific overlay regions can be manipulated by leveraging the video hardware, for example to perform hardware linear interpolation to smooth out the frame and display it fullscreen, and to do automatic rotation when the client runs in landscape mode. 4.",

                "The ratio between the data traffic in the two tests yields a scale factor.",
                "This scale factor shows the loss of data between the server and the client due to inability of the client to process the data quickly enough.",

                "Other approaches to improve the performance of mobile wireless web browsing have focused on using transcoding and caching proxies in conjunction with the fat client model [11, 9, 4, 8].",
                "They work by pushing functionality to external proxies, and using specialized browsing applications on the PDA device that communicate with the proxy.",
                "Our thinclient approach differs fundamentally from these fat-client approaches by pushing all web browser logic to the server, leveraging existing investments in desktop web browsers and helper applications to work seamlessly with production systems without any additional proxy configuration or web browser modifications.",
                "With the emergence of web browsing on small display devices, web sites have been redesigned using mechanisms like WAP and specialized native web browsers have been developed to tailor the needs of these devices.",
                "Recently, Opera has developed the Opera Mini [15] web browser, which uses an approach similar to the thin-client model to provide access across a number of mobile devices that would normally be incapable of running a web browser.",
                "Instead of requiring the device to process web pages, it uses a remote server to pre-process the page before sending it to the phone. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS We have introduced pTHINC, a thin-client architecture for wireless PDAs. pTHINC provides key architectural and usability mechanisms such as server-side screen resizing, clientside screen rotation using simple copy techniques, YUV video support, and maximizing screen space for display updates and leveraging existing PDA control buttons for UI elements. pTHINC transparently supports traditional desktop browsers and their helper applications on PDA devices and desktop machines, providing mobile users with ubiquitous access to a consistent, personalized, and full-featured web environment across heterogeneous devices.",
                "We have implemented pTHINC and measured its performance on web applications compared to existing thin-client systems and native web applications.",
                "Our results on multiple mobile wireless devices demonstrate that pTHINC delivers web browsing performance up to 80 times better than existing thin-client systems, and 8 times better than a native PDA browser.",
                "In addition, pTHINC is the only PDA thin client 151 Figure 11: Video Screenshot: RDP 640x480 Figure 12: Video Screenshot: VNC 1024x768 Figure 13: Video Screenshot: ICA Resized 1024x768 Figure 14: Video Screenshot: pTHINC Resized 1024x768 that transparently provides full-screen, full frame rate video playback, making web sites with multimedia content accessible to mobile web users. 7.",
