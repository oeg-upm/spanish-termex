We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements. The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges. We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree. The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm. Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.

INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web. The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query. However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures. This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links. This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner. Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task. There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance. Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows. If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web. However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult. Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse. To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment. Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text. This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments. However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature. This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work. Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study. Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used. Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments. Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2. RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms. The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research. There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank. Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few. Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others. Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank. For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18]. Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published. We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank. Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query. A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google. By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3. OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges. Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages. These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs. Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded. The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10. Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links. As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS. Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average. It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs. In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental). Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms. Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines. This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query. Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features. Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community. A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents. For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4. MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP. The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank). Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12]. NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges. The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j. The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query. Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG. The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set. The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set. Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise. The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results. The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) . The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set. The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result. We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant. For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings. Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions. Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled. We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query. For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged. This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized. This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment. On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5. COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author. The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u. However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score. In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2. Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it. In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v). One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links. One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph. We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node. Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself. In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration. Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time. This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time. In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank. The computation consists of two distinct phases. In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way. Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer. The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores. The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers. Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster. Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation. The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration. Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory. We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers. PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection. We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph. We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations. Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS. A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log. As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs. These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6. HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm. HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence. Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links. But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous. For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set. Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant. Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B. In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate. Given a set A, the notation Sn[A] draws n elements uniformly at random from A; Sn[A] = A if |A| â‰¤ n. A link section predicate P takes an edge (u, v) âˆˆ E. In this study, we use the following three link section predicates: all(u, v) â‡” true ih(u, v) â‡” host(u) = host(v) id(u, v) â‡” domain(u) = domain(v) where host(u) denotes the host of URL u, and domain(u) denotes the domain of URL u. So, all is true for all links, whereas ih is true only for inter-host links, and id is true only for inter-domain links. The outlinked-set OP of the root set R w.r.t. a linkselection predicate P is defined to be: OP = [ uâˆˆR {v âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)} The inlinking-set IP s of the root set R w.r.t. a link-selection predicate P and a sampling value s is defined to be: IP s = [ vâˆˆR Ss[{u âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)}] The base set BP s of the root set R w.r.t. P and s is defined to be: BP s = R âˆª IP s âˆª OP The neighborhood graph (BP s , NP s ) has the base set BP s as its vertex set and an edge set NP s containing those edges in E that are covered by BP s and permitted by P: NP s = {(u, v) âˆˆ E : u âˆˆ BP s âˆ§ v âˆˆ BP s âˆ§ P(u, v)} To simplify notation, we write B to denote BP s , and N to denote NP s . For each node u in the neighborhood graph, HITS computes two scores: an authority score A(u), estimating how authoritative u is on the topic induced by the query, and a hub score H(u), indicating whether u is a good reference to many authoritative pages. This is done using the following algorithm: 1. For all u âˆˆ B do H(u) := q 1 |B| , A(u) := q 1 |B| . 2. Repeat until H and A converge: (a) For all v âˆˆ B : A (v) := P (u,v)âˆˆN H(u) (b) For all u âˆˆ B : H (u) := P (u,v)âˆˆN A(v) (c) H := H 2, A := A 2 where X 2 normalizes the vector X to unit length in euclidean space, i.e. the squares of its elements sum up to 1. In practice, implementing a system that can compute HITS within the time constraints of a major search engine (where the peak query load is in the thousands of queries per second, and the desired query response time is well below one second) is a major engineering challenge. Among other things, the web graph cannot reasonably be stored on disk, since .221 .106 .105 .104 .102 .095 .092 .090 .038 .036 .035 .034 .032 .032 .011 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 bm25f degree-in-id degree-in-ih hits-aut-id-25 hits-aut-ih-100 degree-in-all pagerank hits-aut-all-100 hits-hub-all-100 hits-hub-ih-100 hits-hub-id-100 degree-out-all degree-out-ih degree-out-id random NDCG@10 .100 .035 .033 .033 .033 .029 .027 .027 .008 .007 .007 .006 .006 .006 .002 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 bm25f hits-aut-id-9 degree-in-id hits-aut-ih-15 degree-in-ih degree-in-all pagerank hits-aut-all-100 hits-hub-all-100 hits-hub-ih-100 hits-hub-id-100 degree-out-all degree-out-ih degree-out-id random MAP@10 .273 .132 .126 .117 .114 .101 .101 .097 .032 .032 .030 .028 .027 .027 .007 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 bm25f hits-aut-id-9 hits-aut-ih-15 degree-in-id degree-in-ih degree-in-all hits-aut-all-100 pagerank hits-hub-all-100 hits-hub-ih-100 hits-hub-id-100 degree-out-all degree-out-ih degree-out-id random MRR@10 Figure 2: Effectiveness of different features. seek times of modern hard disks are too slow to retrieve the links within the time constraints, and the graph does not fit into the main memory of a single machine, even when using the most aggressive compression techniques. In order to experiment with HITS and other query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms that require non-regular accesses to arbitrary nodes and edges in the web graph, we implemented a system called the Scalable Hyperlink Store, or SHS for short. SHS is a special-purpose database, distributed over an arbitrary number of machines that keeps a highly compressed version of the web graph in memory and allows very fast lookup of nodes and edges. On our hardware, it takes an average of 2 microseconds to map a URL to a 64-bit integer handle called a UID, 15 microseconds to look up all incoming or outgoing link UIDs associated with a page UID, and 5 microseconds to map a UID back to a URL (the last functionality not being required by HITS). The RPC overhead is about 100 microseconds, but the SHS API allows many lookups to be batched into a single RPC request. We implemented the HITS algorithm using the SHS infrastructure. We compiled three SHS databases, one containing all 17.6 billion links in our web graph (all), one containing only links between pages that are on different hosts (ih, for inter-host), and one containing only links between pages that are on different domains (id). We consider two URLs to belong to different hosts if the host portions of the URLs differ (in other words, we make no attempt to determine whether two distinct symbolic host names refer to the same computer), and we consider a domain to be the name purchased from a registrar (for example, we consider news.bbc.co.uk and www.bbc.co.uk to be different hosts belonging to the same domain). Using each of these databases, we computed HITS authority and hub scores for various parameterizations of the sampling operator S, sampling between 1 and 100 back-links of each page in the root set. Result URLs that were not covered by our web graph automatically received authority and hub scores of 0, since they were not connected to any other nodes in the neighborhood graph and therefore did not receive any endorsements. We performed forty-five different HITS computations, each combining one of the three link selection predicates (all, ih, and id) with a sampling value. For each combination, we loaded one of the three databases into an SHS system running on six machines (each equipped with 16 GB of RAM), and computed HITS authority and hub scores, one query at a time. The longest-running combination (using the all database and sampling 100 back-links of each root set vertex) required 30,456 seconds to process the entire query set, or about 1.1 seconds per query on average. 7. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS For a given query Q, we need to rank the set of documents satisfying Q (the result set of Q). Our hypothesis is that good features should be able to rank relevant documents in this set higher than non-relevant ones, and this should result in an increase in each performance measure over the query set. We are specifically interested in evaluating the usefulness of HITS and other link-based features. In principle, we could do this by sorting the documents in each result set by their feature value, and compare the resulting NDCGs. We call this ranking with isolated features. Let us first examine the relative performance of the different parameterizations of the HITS algorithm we examined. Recall that we computed HITS for each combination of three link section schemes - all links (all), inter-host links only (ih), and inter-domain links only (id) - with back-link sampling values ranging from 1 to 100. Figure 1 shows the impact of the number of sampled back-links on the retrieval performance of HITS authority scores. Each graph is associated with one performance measure. The horizontal axis of each graph represents the number of sampled back-links, the vertical axis represents performance under the appropriate measure, and each curve depicts a link selection scheme. The id scheme slightly outperforms ih, and both vastly outperform the all scheme - eliminating nepotistic links pays off. The performance of the all scheme increases as more back-links of each root set vertex are sampled, while the performance of the id and ih schemes peaks at between 10 and 25 samples and then plateaus or even declines, depending on the performance measure. Having compared different parameterizations of HITS, we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100 and compare the three link selection schemes against other isolated features: PageRank, in-degree and out-degree counting links of all pages, of different hosts only and of different domains only (all, ih and id datasets respectively), and a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text: BM25F[24]. BM25F is a state-of-the art ranking function solely based on textual content of the documents and their associated anchor texts. BM25F is a descendant of BM25 that combines the different textual fields of a document, namely title, body and anchor text. This model has been shown to be one of the best-performing web search scoring functions over the last few years [8, 24]. BM25F has a number of free parameters (2 per field, 6 in our case); we used the parameter values described in [24]. .341 .340 .339 .337 .336 .336 .334 .311 .311 .310 .310 .310 .310 .231 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 degree-in-id degree-in-ih degree-in-all hits-aut-ih-100 hits-aut-all-100 pagerank hits-aut-id-10 degree-out-all hits-hub-all-100 degree-out-ih hits-hub-ih-100 degree-out-id hits-hub-id-10 bm25f NDCG@10 .152 .152 .151 .150 .150 .149 .149 .137 .136 .136 .128 .127 .127 .100 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0.16 degree-in-ih degree-in-id degree-in-all hits-aut-ih-100 hits-aut-all-100 hits-aut-id-10 pagerank hits-hub-all-100 degree-out-ih hits-hub-id-100 degree-out-all degree-out-id hits-hub-ih-100 bm25f MAP@10 .398 .397 .394 .394 .392 .392 .391 .356 .356 .356 .356 .356 .355 .273 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 degree-in-id degree-in-ih degree-in-all hits-aut-ih-100 hits-aut-all-100 pagerank hits-aut-id-10 degree-out-all hits-hub-all-100 degree-out-ih hits-hub-ih-100 degree-out-id hits-hub-id-10 bm25f MRR@10 Figure 3: Effectiveness measures for linear combinations of link-based features with BM25F. Figure 2 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these features. Again all performance measures (and for all rank-thresholds we explored) agree. As expected, BM25F outperforms all link-based features by a large margin. The link-based features are divided into two groups, with a noticeable performance drop between the groups. The better-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of incoming links (in-degree, PageRank, and HITS authority scores); and the worse-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of outgoing links (outdegree and HITS hub scores). In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links. Moreover, using only inter-domain (id) links seems to be marginally better than using inter-host (ih) links. The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all. On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising. A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set. Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores. However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons. First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance. Second, link-based features can be strongly correlated with textual features for several reasons, mainly the correlation between in-degree and numFeature Transform function bm25f T(s) = s pagerank T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’12 ) degree-in-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’2 ) degree-out-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 103 ) hits-aut-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’8 ) hits-hub-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’1 ) Table 1: Near-optimal feature transform functions. ber of textual anchor matches. Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features. Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance. For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F. All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned. We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited. Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions. This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8]. We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions. We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function. Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations. Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1. Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2. The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3. The performance differences between the various combinations of BM25F with features based on incoming links is comparatively small, and the relative ordering of feature combinations is fairly stable across the 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 bm25fnorm pagerank degree-in-id hits-aut-id-100 Figure 4: Effectiveness measures for selected isolated features, broken down by query specificity. ferent performance measures used. However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster. Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others. Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features. The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q. Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information. Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q. The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other. However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct. We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket. In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F. Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets. Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries. The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries). BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14). By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F). Evaluation is carried out with respect to a large number of human evaluated queries, using three different measures of effectiveness: NDCG, MRR, and MAP. Evaluating link-based features in isolation, we found that web page in-degree outperforms PageRank, and is about as effwective as HITS authority scores. HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering. A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little. We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes. There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road. Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS. In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not. Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA. Finally, we are planning to experiment with more complex feature combinations. 9. REFERENCES [1] B. Amento, L. Terveen, and W. Hill. Does authority mean quality?

Cuantificamos su efectividad utilizando tres medidas de rendimiento comunes: el rango recÃ­proco medio, la precisiÃ³n promedio media y las mediciones de ganancia acumulativa con descuento normalizadas. La evaluaciÃ³n se basa en dos grandes conjuntos de datos: un rastreo de bÃºsqueda de amplitud de 463 millones de pÃ¡ginas web que contienen 17.6 mil millones de hipervÃ­nculos y hacen referencia a 2.900 millones de URL distintas;y un conjunto de 28,043 consultas muestreadas de un registro de consultas, cada consulta que tiene en promedio 2,383 resultados, aproximadamente 17 de los cuales fueron etiquetados por jueces. Descubrimos que los golpes superan a PageRank, pero es tan efectivo como la pÃ¡gina web en el grado. Lo mismo es cierto cuando cualquiera de las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces se combina con el algoritmo de recuperaciÃ³n de texto. Finalmente, estudiamos la relaciÃ³n entre la especificidad de la consulta y la efectividad de las caracterÃ­sticas seleccionadas, y encontramos que las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces funcionan mejor para consultas generales, mientras que BM25F funciona mejor para consultas especÃ­ficas. CategorÃ­as y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [BÃºsqueda y recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n]: proceso de bÃºsqueda de informaciÃ³n y bÃºsqueda de recuperaciÃ³n, proceso de selecciÃ³n TÃ©rminos generales Algoritmos, mediciÃ³n, experimentaciÃ³n 1. Se ha demostrado que las caracterÃ­sticas del grÃ¡fico de enlaces de introducciÃ³n, como Inde y PageRank, mejoran significativamente el rendimiento de los algoritmos de recuperaciÃ³n de texto en la web. TambiÃ©n se cree que el algoritmo de Ã©xitos es de interÃ©s para la bÃºsqueda web;Hasta cierto punto, uno puede esperar que los Ã©xitos sean mÃ¡s informativos de que otras caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces porque depende de la consulta: trata de medir el interÃ©s de las pÃ¡ginas con respecto a una consulta dada. Sin embargo, no estÃ¡ claro hoy si existen beneficios prÃ¡cticos de los Ã©xitos sobre otras medidas de grÃ¡ficos de enlace. Esto es aÃºn mÃ¡s cierto cuando consideramos que los algoritmos de recuperaciÃ³n modernos utilizados en la web usan una representaciÃ³n de documentos que incorpora el texto de anclaje de documentos, es decir, el texto de los enlaces entrantes. Esto, al menos hasta cierto punto, tiene en cuenta el grÃ¡fico de enlace, de manera dependiente de la consulta. Comparar los Ã©xitos con PageRank o en el grado empÃ­ricamente no es una tarea fÃ¡cil. Hay dos dificultades principales: escala y relevancia. La escala es importante porque se sabe que las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces mejoran en calidad a medida que crece el grÃ¡fico de documentos. Si realizamos un pequeÃ±o experimento, nuestras conclusiones no se transferirÃ¡n a grÃ¡ficos grandes como la web. Sin embargo, la computaciÃ³n golpea de manera eficiente en un grÃ¡fico del tamaÃ±o de un rastreo web realista es extraordinariamente difÃ­cil. La relevancia tambiÃ©n es crucial porque no podemos medir el rendimiento de una caracterÃ­stica en ausencia de juicios humanos: lo que es crucial es clasificarse en la parte superior de los diez documentos que un usuario examinarÃ¡. Hasta donde sabemos, este documento es el primer intento de evaluar los golpes a gran escala y compararlo con otras caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces con respecto al juicio evaluado humano. Nuestros resultados confirman muchas de las intuiciones que tenemos sobre las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces y su relaciÃ³n con los mÃ©todos de recuperaciÃ³n de texto que explotan el texto de anclaje. Esto es tranquilizador: en ausencia de un modelo teÃ³rico capaz de vincular estas medidas con relevancia, la Ãºnica forma de validar nuestras intuiciones es llevar a cabo experimentos realistas. Sin embargo, nos sorprendiÃ³ bastante encontrar que Hits, una caracterÃ­stica dependiente de la consulta, es casi tan efectiva como la pÃ¡gina web en grado, la caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces mÃ¡s simplificadas de consulta. Esto sigue siendo cierto cuando las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces se combinan con un algoritmo de recuperaciÃ³n de texto que explota el texto de anclaje. El resto de este documento estÃ¡ estructurado de la siguiente manera: SecciÃ³n 2 de trabajo relacionado con encuestas. La SecciÃ³n 3 describe los conjuntos de datos que utilizamos en nuestro estudio. La SecciÃ³n 4 revisa las medidas de rendimiento que utilizamos. Las secciones 5 y 6 describen los algoritmos de PageRank y golpea con mÃ¡s detalle y dibujan la infraestructura computacional que empleamos para llevar a cabo experimentos a gran escala. La SecciÃ³n 7 presenta los resultados de nuestras evaluaciones, y la SecciÃ³n 8 ofrece comentarios finales.2. Trabajo relacionado La idea de usar el anÃ¡lisis de hipervÃ­nculos para clasificar los resultados de bÃºsqueda web surgiÃ³ alrededor de 1997, y se manifestÃ³ en los algoritmos de Ã©xitos [16, 17] y PageRank [5, 21]. La popularidad de estos dos algoritmos y el Ã©xito fenomenal del motor de bÃºsqueda de Google, que utiliza PageRank, ha generado una gran cantidad de investigaciones posteriores. Existen numerosos intentos para mejorar la efectividad de los Ã©xitos y el PageRank. Los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces dependientes de la consulta inspirados en los Ã©xitos incluyen salsa [19], golpes aleatorios [20] y phits [7], por nombrar algunos. Los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces independientes de la consulta inspirados en PageRank incluyen Trafficank [22], Blockrank [14] y Trustrank [11] y muchos otros. Otra lÃ­nea de investigaciÃ³n se refiere a analizar las propiedades matemÃ¡ticas de los Ã©xitos y PageRank. Por ejemplo, Borodin et al.[3] investigÃ³ varias propiedades teÃ³ricas de PageRank, golpes, salsa y phits, incluida su similitud y estabilidad, mientras que Bianchini et al.[2] estudiÃ³ la relaciÃ³n entre la estructura del grÃ¡fico web y la distribuciÃ³n de las puntuaciones de PageRank, y Langville y Meyer examinaron las propiedades bÃ¡sicas de PageRank, como la existencia y la singularidad de un vector propio y la convergencia de la iteraciÃ³n de energÃ­a [18]. Dada la atenciÃ³n que se ha prestado a mejorar la efectividad de PageRank y los Ã©xitos, y los estudios exhaustivos de las propiedades matemÃ¡ticas de estos algoritmos, es algo sorprendente que se hayan publicado muy pocas evaluaciones de su efectividad. Somos conscientes de dos estudios que han intentado evaluar formalmente la efectividad de los Ã©xitos y de PageRank. Amento et al.[1] empleÃ³ medidas cuantitativas, pero basÃ³ sus experimentos en los conjuntos de resultados de solo 5 consultas y el grÃ¡fico web inducido por rastreos tÃ³picos en torno al conjunto de resultados de cada consulta. Un estudio mÃ¡s reciente de Borodin et al.[4] se basa en 34 consultas, conjuntos de resultados de 200 pÃ¡ginas por consulta obtenida de Google, y un grÃ¡fico de vecindario derivado recuperando 50 en enlace por resultado de Google. Por el contrario, nuestro estudio se basa en mÃ¡s de 28,000 consultas y un grÃ¡fico web que cubre 2.9 mil millones de URL.3. Nuestros conjuntos de datos Nuestra evaluaciÃ³n se basa en dos conjuntos de datos: un grÃ¡fico web grande y un conjunto sustancial de consultas con resultados asociados, algunos de los cuales fueron etiquetados por jueces humanos. Nuestro grÃ¡fico web se basa en un rastreo web que se realizÃ³ de manera amplia, y recuperÃ³ con Ã©xito 463,685,607 pÃ¡ginas HTML. Estas pÃ¡ginas contienen 17,672,011,890 hipervÃ­nculos (despuÃ©s de eliminar hipervÃ­nculos duplicados incrustados en la misma pÃ¡gina web), que se refieren a un total de 2,897,671,002 URL. Por lo tanto, al final del rastreo habÃ­a 2.433,985,395 URL en el conjunto de fronteras del rastreador que se habÃ­a descubierto, pero aÃºn no se descargÃ³. El grado medio de las pÃ¡ginas web rastreadas es 38.11;La media en grados de las pÃ¡ginas descubiertas (ya sea rastreadas o no) es 6.10. AdemÃ¡s, vale la pena seÃ±alar que hay mucha mÃ¡s variaciÃ³n en los grados que en grados externos;Algunas pÃ¡ginas populares tienen millones de enlaces entrantes. Como veremos, esta propiedad afecta el costo computacional de los Ã©xitos. Nuestro conjunto de consultas se produjo muestras de 28,043 consultas del registro de consultas de bÃºsqueda MSN, y recuperando un total de 66,846,214 URL de resultados para estas consultas (usando tecnologÃ­a de motores de bÃºsqueda comercial), o aproximadamente 2,838 resultados por consulta en promedio. Es importante seÃ±alar que nuestro grÃ¡fico web de URL de 2.900 millones no cubre todas estas URL de resultados. De hecho, solo 9,525,566 de las URL de resultados (alrededor del 14,25%) estaban cubiertas por el grÃ¡fico.485,656 de los resultados en el conjunto de consultas (aproximadamente el 0,73% de todos los resultados, o aproximadamente 17.3 resultados por consulta) fueron calificados por jueces humanos en cuanto a su relevancia para la consulta dada, y etiquetadas en una escala de seis puntos (las etiquetas son definitivas definitivas, excelente, bueno, justo, malo y perjudicial). Los resultados fueron seleccionados para el juicio en funciÃ³n de la colocaciÃ³n de su motor de bÃºsqueda comercial;En otras palabras, el subconjunto de resultados etiquetados no es aleatorio, sino sesgado hacia documentos considerados relevantes por los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n preexistentes. Involucrar a un humano en el proceso de evaluaciÃ³n es extremadamente engorroso y costoso;Sin embargo, los juicios humanos son cruciales para la evaluaciÃ³n de los motores de bÃºsqueda. Esto es asÃ­ porque aÃºn no se han encontrado caracterÃ­sticas de documento que puedan estimar efectivamente la relevancia de un documento para una consulta de usuario. Dado que las caracterÃ­sticas del partido de contenido son muy poco confiables (y aÃºn mÃ¡s las caracterÃ­sticas de enlace, como veremos), debemos pedirle a un humano que evalÃºe los resultados para comparar la calidad de las caracterÃ­sticas. La evaluaciÃ³n de los resultados de recuperaciÃ³n de los puntajes de documentos y los juicios humanos no es trivial y ha sido objeto de muchas investigaciones en la comunidad IR. Una buena medida de rendimiento debe correlacionarse con la satisfacciÃ³n del usuario, teniendo en cuenta que a los usuarios no les gustarÃ¡ tener que profundizar en los resultados para encontrar documentos relevantes. Por esta razÃ³n, las medidas de correlaciÃ³n estÃ¡ndar (como el coeficiente de correlaciÃ³n entre el puntaje y el juicio de un documento), o las medidas de correlaciÃ³n de orden (como Kendall Tau entre el puntaje y las Ã³rdenes inducidas por el juicio) no son adecuadas.4. MediciÃ³n del rendimiento En este estudio, cuantificamos la efectividad de varios algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n utilizando tres medidas: NDCG, MRR y MAP. La medida de ganancias acumuladas con descuento normalizadas (NDCG) [13] descuenta la contribuciÃ³n de un documento al puntaje general a medida que aumenta el rango de documentos (suponiendo que el mejor documento tiene el rango mÃ¡s bajo). Dicha medida es particularmente apropiada para los motores de bÃºsqueda, ya que los estudios han demostrado que los usuarios de los motores de bÃºsqueda rara vez consideran algo mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de los primeros resultados [12]. Los valores de NDCG estÃ¡n normalizados para estar entre 0 y 1, siendo 1 el NDCG de un esquema de clasificaciÃ³n perfecto que estÃ¡ completamente de acuerdo con la evaluaciÃ³n de los jueces humanos. La ganancia acumulada con descuento en un rango de rango particular t (dcg@t) se define como pt j = 1 1 log (1+j) 2r (j)-1, donde r (j) es la calificaciÃ³n (0 = perjudicial, 1 = malo, 2 = justo, 3 = bueno, 4 = excelente y 5 = definitivo) en el rango j. El NDCG se calcula dividiendo el DCG de una clasificaciÃ³n por el DCG mÃ¡s alto posible que se puede obtener para esa consulta. Finalmente, los NDGC de todas las consultas en el conjunto de consultas se promedian para producir un NDCG medio. El rango recÃ­proco (RR) del conjunto de resultados clasificado de una consulta se define como el valor recÃ­proco del rango del documento relevante de mÃ¡s alto rango en el conjunto de resultados. El RR en el umbral de rango T se define como 0 si ninguno de los documentos T de alojamiento es relevante. El rango recÃ­proco medio (MRR) de un conjunto de consultas es el rango recÃ­proco promedio de todas las consultas en el conjunto de consultas. Dado un conjunto clasificado de n resultados, deje que R (i) sea 1 si el resultado en el Rango I es relevante y 0 de lo contrario. La precisiÃ³n p (j) en el rango J se define como 1 J Pj I = 1 Rel (i), es decir, la fracciÃ³n de los resultados relevantes entre los resultados de mÃ¡s alto rango. La precisiÃ³n promedio (AP) en el umbral de rango K se define como PK I = 1 P (I) Rel (I) Pn I = 1 Rel (I). La precisiÃ³n promedio media (MAP) de un conjunto de consultas es la media de las precisiones promedio de todas las consultas en el conjunto de consultas. Las definiciones anteriores de MRR y MAP se basan en la nociÃ³n de un resultado relevante. Investigamos dos definiciones de relevancia: una en la que todos los documentos calificados de manera justa o mejor se consideraron relevantes, y uno fue todos los documentos calificados de buenos o mejor se consideraron relevantes. Por razones de espacio, solo informamos los valores de mapa y MRR calculados utilizando la Ãºltima definiciÃ³n;Usar la definiciÃ³n anterior no cambia la naturaleza cualitativa de nuestros hallazgos. Del mismo modo, calculamos los valores de NDCG, MAP y MRR para un amplio rango de umbral de rango;Informamos los resultados aquÃ­ en el rango 10;Nuevamente, cambiar el umbral de rango nunca nos llevÃ³ a diferentes conclusiones. Recuerde que mÃ¡s del 99% de los documentos no estÃ¡n etiquetados. Elegimos tratar todos estos documentos como irrelevantes para la consulta. Sin embargo, para algunas consultas, no se han juzgado todos los documentos relevantes. Esto introduce un sesgo en nuestra evaluaciÃ³n: las caracterÃ­sticas que traen nuevos documentos a la parte superior del rango pueden ser penalizadas. Esto serÃ¡ mÃ¡s agudo para las caracterÃ­sticas menos correlacionadas con los algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n comercial preexistentes utilizados para seleccionar documentos para el juicio. Por otro lado, la mayorÃ­a de las consultas tienen pocos documentos relevantes perfectos (es decir, la pÃ¡gina de inicio o las bÃºsquedas de elementos) y con mayor frecuencia estarÃ¡n dentro del conjunto juzgado.5. Computing PageRank en un gran grÃ¡fico web de PageRank es una medida independiente de la consulta de la importancia de las pÃ¡ginas web, basada en la nociÃ³n de entregamiento de pares: un hipervÃ­nculo de la pÃ¡gina A a la pÃ¡gina B se interpreta como un respaldo del contenido de la pÃ¡gina BS tanautor. La siguiente definiciÃ³n recursiva captura esta nociÃ³n de endoso: r (v) = x (u, v) âˆˆE r (u) out (u) donde r (v) es el puntaje (importancia) de la pÃ¡gina v, (u, v)es un borde (hipervÃ­nculo) desde la pÃ¡gina U a la pÃ¡gina V contenida en el conjunto de borde del grÃ¡fico web, y fuera (u) es el grado externo (nÃºmero de hipervÃ­nculos incrustados) de la pÃ¡gina u. Sin embargo, esta definiciÃ³n sufre de una deficiencia severa: en el punto fijo de esta ecuaciÃ³n recursiva, solo los bordes que forman parte de un componente fuertemente conectado reciben una puntuaciÃ³n no cero. Para superar esta deficiencia, Page et al.otorgue a cada pÃ¡gina un puntaje mÃ­nimo garantizado, dando lugar a la definiciÃ³n de PageRank estÃ¡ndar: R (V) = D | V |+ (1 - d) x (u, v) âˆˆE r (u) out (u) donde | v |es el tamaÃ±o del conjunto de vÃ©rtices (el nÃºmero de pÃ¡ginas web conocidas), y D es un factor de amortiguaciÃ³n, tÃ­picamente establecido entre 0.1 y 0.2. Suponiendo que los puntajes se normalizan para resumir hasta 1, PageRank se puede ver como la distribuciÃ³n de probabilidad estacionaria de una caminata aleatoria en el grÃ¡fico web, donde en cada paso de la caminata, el caminante con probabilidad 1 - D se mueve desde su nodo actual u u ua un nodo vecino V, y con la probabilidad D selecciona un nodo uniforme al azar de todos los nodos en el grÃ¡fico y salta a Ã©l. En el lÃ­mite, el caminante aleatorio estÃ¡ en el nodo V con probabilidad R (V). Un problema que debe abordarse al implementar PageRank es cÃ³mo lidiar con los nodos fregaderos, nodos que no tienen ningÃºn enlace saliente. Una posibilidad serÃ­a seleccionar otro nodo uniformemente al azar y la transiciÃ³n a Ã©l;Esto es equivalente a agregar bordes de cada fregadero a todos los demÃ¡s nodos en el grÃ¡fico. Elegimos el enfoque alternativo de introducir un solo nodo fantasma. Cada nodo de sumidero tiene un borde al nodo fantasma, y el nodo fantasma tiene un borde en sÃ­ mismo. En la prÃ¡ctica, los puntajes de PageRank se pueden calcular utilizando Power Iteration. Dado que PageRank es independiente de la consulta, el cÃ¡lculo se puede realizar fuera de lÃ­nea antes del tiempo de consulta. Esta propiedad ha sido clave para el Ã©xito de PageRanks, ya que es un problema de ingenierÃ­a desafiante para construir un sistema que pueda realizar cualquier cÃ¡lculo no trivial en el grÃ¡fico web en el momento de la consulta. Para calcular las puntuaciones de PageRank para los 2.900 millones de nodos en nuestro grÃ¡fico web, implementamos una versiÃ³n distribuida de PageRank. El cÃ¡lculo consta de dos fases distintas. En la primera fase, los archivos de enlace producidos por el rastreador web, que contienen URL de pÃ¡gina y sus URL de enlace asociadas en forma textual, se dividen entre las mÃ¡quinas en el clÃºster utilizadas para calcular las puntuaciones de PageRank y se convierten en un formato mÃ¡s compacto a lo largo del formato a lo largo delforma. EspecÃ­ficamente, las URL se dividen en las mÃ¡quinas en el clÃºster basada en un hash del componente host de URL, y cada mÃ¡quina en el clÃºster mantiene una tabla que mapea la URL a un entero de 32 bits. Los enteros se extraen de un espacio densamente empaquetado, a fin de hacer Ã­ndices adecuados en la matriz que luego sostendrÃ¡ las puntuaciones de PageRank. Luego, el sistema traduce nuestro registro de pÃ¡ginas y sus hipervÃ­nculos asociados a una representaciÃ³n compacta donde las URL de la pÃ¡gina y las URL de enlace estÃ¡n representadas por sus enteros asociados de 32 bits. El hashing el componente del host de las URL garantiza que todas las URL del mismo host se asignan a la misma mÃ¡quina en nuestro clÃºster de puntuaciÃ³n. Dado que mÃ¡s del 80% de todos los hipervÃ­nculos en la web son relativos (es decir, son entre dos pÃ¡ginas en el mismo host), esta propiedad reduce en gran medida la cantidad de comunicaciÃ³n de red requerida por la segunda etapa del cÃ¡lculo de puntuaciÃ³n distribuido. La segunda fase realiza la iteraciÃ³n de potencia de PageRank real. Tanto los datos de enlace como el vector de PageRank actual residen en el disco y se leen de forma transmisible;mientras que el nuevo Vector PageRank se mantiene en la memoria. Representamos los puntajes de PageRank como nÃºmeros de puntos flotantes de 64 bits. Las contribuciones de PageRank a las pÃ¡ginas asignadas a mÃ¡quinas remotas se transmiten a la mÃ¡quina remota a travÃ©s de una conexiÃ³n TCP. Utilizamos un clÃºster de tres mÃ¡quinas, cada mÃ¡quina equipada con 16 GB de RAM, para calcular las puntuaciones estÃ¡ndar de PageRank para todas las URL de 2.900 millones que estaban contenidas en nuestro grÃ¡fico web. Utilizamos un factor de amortiguaciÃ³n de 0,15 y realizamos 200 iteraciones de potencia. A partir de la iteraciÃ³n 165, la norma Lâˆž del cambio en el vector de PageRank de una iteraciÃ³n a la siguiente habÃ­a dejado de disminuir, lo que indica que habÃ­amos alcanzado un punto tan fijo como lo permitirÃ­an las limitaciones de la aritmÃ©tica de punto flotante de 64 bits.0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 NÃºmero de enlaces posteriores muestreados por resultado ndcg@10 hits-aut-the Hits-Aut-ih Hits-Aut-ID 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 NÃºmero de enlaces posteriores Mapa de resultados de resultados@10 Hits-Aut-All Hits-Aut-IH Hits-Aut-ID 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 NÃºmero de vÃ­nculos posteriores muestreados por resultado MRR@10 Hits-Aut-All Hits-Aut-IH Hits Hits-Aut-ID Figura 1: Efectividad de las puntuaciones de autoridad calculadas utilizando diferentes parametrizaciones de golpes. Una fase de postprocesamiento utiliza los vectores de PageRank final (uno por mÃ¡quina) y las URL de mapeo de la tabla a enteros de 32 bits (que representan Ã­ndices en cada vector de PageRank) para obtener la URL de resultados en nuestro registro de consultas. Como se mencionÃ³ anteriormente, nuestro grÃ¡fico web cubriÃ³ 9,525,566 de las 66,846,214 URL de resultados. Estas URL fueron anotadas con su puntaje calculado de PageRank;Todas las demÃ¡s URL recibieron una puntuaciÃ³n de 0. 6. Hits Hits, a diferencia de PageRank, es un algoritmo de clasificaciÃ³n dependiente de la consulta. Los golpes (que representa la bÃºsqueda de temas inducida por hipertexto) se basan en las siguientes dos intuiciones: Primero, los hipervÃ­nculos pueden verse como endosos de actualidad: un hipervÃ­nculo de una pÃ¡gina U dedicado al Tema T a otra pÃ¡gina V es probable que respalde la autoridad de V VCon respecto al tema T. En segundo lugar, es probable que el conjunto de resultados de una consulta particular tenga una cierta cantidad de coherencia tÃ³pica. Por lo tanto, tiene sentido realizar un anÃ¡lisis de enlaces no en todo el grÃ¡fico web, sino solo en el vecindario de las pÃ¡ginas contenidas en el conjunto de resultados, ya que es mÃ¡s probable que este vecindario contenga enlaces tÃ³picamente relevantes. Pero si bien el conjunto de nodos inmediatamente accesibles desde el conjunto de resultados es manejable (dado que la mayorÃ­a de las pÃ¡ginas tienen solo un nÃºmero limitado de hipervÃ­nculos incrustados en ellos), el conjunto de pÃ¡ginas que conducen inmediatamente al conjunto de resultados puede ser enorme. Por esta razÃ³n, Kleinberg sugiere un muestreo de un subconjunto aleatorio de tamaÃ±o fijo de las pÃ¡ginas que vinculan a cualquier pÃ¡gina de alto nivel en el conjunto de resultados. AdemÃ¡s, Kleinberg sugiere considerar solo enlaces que cruzan los lÃ­mites del huÃ©sped, la justificaciÃ³n es que es probable que los enlaces entre pÃ¡ginas en el mismo host (enlaces intrÃ­nsecos) sean navegaciÃ³n o nepotistas y no son relevantes tÃ³picamente. Dado un grÃ¡fico web (v, e) con el conjunto de vÃ©rtices V y el conjunto de borde E âŠ† V Ã— V, y el conjunto de URL de resultados a una consulta (llamada raÃ­z REJE R âŠ† V) como entrada, golpea calcula un grÃ¡fico del vecindario que consiste enun conjunto base B âŠ† V (el conjunto de raÃ­ces y algunos de sus vÃ©rtices vecinos) y algunos de los bordes en E inducidos por B. Para formalizar la definiciÃ³n del grÃ¡fico del vecindario, es Ãºtil introducir primero un operador de muestreo y el concepto de un predicado de LinkSelection. Dado un conjunto A, la notaciÃ³n sn [a] dibuja n elementos uniformemente al azar de a;Sn [a] = a if | a |â‰¤ n.Una secciÃ³n de enlace predicada P toma un borde (u, v) âˆˆ E. En este estudio, usamos los siguientes tres predicados de secciÃ³n de enlace: todos (U, V) â‡” Verdadero Ih (U, V) â‡” Host (U) = Host(v) id (u, v) â‡” dominio (u) = dominio (v) donde el huÃ©sped (u) denota el huÃ©sped de URL u, y el dominio (u) denota el dominio de la url u. Por lo tanto, todo es cierto para todos los enlaces, mientras que IH es cierto solo para enlaces entre anfitriones, y la identificaciÃ³n es verdadera solo para enlaces entre dominios. La OP de set retirada de la raÃ­z establecida R W.R.T.Se define un predicado de LinkSelection P: OP = [UâˆˆR {V âˆˆ V: (U, V) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P (U, V)} Las ip s de conjunto de insultos del conjunto de raÃ­z R W.R.T.Se define un predicado de enlace a la selecciÃ³n P y un valor de muestreo s: IP s = [vâˆˆR ss [{u âˆˆ V: (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ p (u, v)}] La base establece BPS de la raÃ­z establecida R W.R.T. P y S se define como: BP S = R âˆª IP S âˆª OP El grÃ¡fico del vecindario (BP S, NP S) tiene el conjunto base BP S como su conjunto de vÃ©rtice y un conjunto de borde que contiene esos bordes en E que soncubierto por BP sy permitido por p: np s = {(u, v) âˆˆ E: u âˆˆ Bp s âˆ§ v âˆˆ Bp s âˆ§ p (u, v)} para simplificar la notaciÃ³n, escribimos B para denotar bp s,y N para denotar np s. Para cada nodo U en el grÃ¡fico del vecindario, los golpes calculan dos puntajes: un puntaje de autoridad A (u), estimando cuÃ¡n autorizado es U en el tema inducido por la consulta y un puntaje de concentraciÃ³n H (u), lo que indica si U es un buenreferencia a muchas pÃ¡ginas autorizadas. Esto se realiza utilizando el siguiente algoritmo: 1. Para todos los u âˆˆ B do H (U): = Q 1 | B |, A (U): = Q 1 | B |.2. Repita hasta que H y A convergen: (a) para todos v âˆˆ B: A (V): = P (U, V) âˆˆN H (U) (B) para todos los u âˆˆ B: H (U): = P (P (P (P (P (U, V) âˆˆN A (V) (C) H: = H 2, A: = A 2 donde x 2 normaliza el vector X a la longitud de la unidad en el espacio euclidiano, es decir, los cuadrados de sus elementos se suman hasta 1. En la prÃ¡ctica, la implementaciÃ³n de un sistema que puede calcular los golpes dentro de las limitaciones de tiempo de un motor de bÃºsqueda importante (donde la carga mÃ¡xima de consulta se encuentra en miles de consultas por segundo, y el tiempo de respuesta de consulta deseado estÃ¡ muy por debajo de un segundo) es una ingenierÃ­a importantedesafÃ­o. Entre otras cosas, el grÃ¡fico web no puede almacenarse razonablemente en el disco, ya que .221 .106 .105 .104 .102 .095 .092 .090 .038 .036 .035 .034 .032 .032 .011 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.200.25 BM25F Grado en ID de ID en IH Hits-Aut-ID-25 Hits-Aut-IH-100 Grado en todo PageRank Hits-Aut-All-100 Hits-HIB-ALL-ALL-100 HITS-HUB-IH-100 HITS-HUB-ID-100 Grado-Out-All Grado-IH IH ID-ID Random NDCG@10 .100 .035 .033 .033 .033 .029 .027 .027 .008 .007.007 .006 .006 .006 .002 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 BM25F Hits-Aut-ID-9 Grado-ID Hits-Aut-IH-15 Grado en IH PageRank Hits-Aut-Aut-Aut-All-100 HITS-HUB-ALL-100 HITS-HITS-HUB-IH-100 HITS-HUB-ID-ID-100 Grado-ALTO-ALTO-IH IH IH Mapa aleatorio@10 .273 .132 .126.117 .114 .101 .101 .097 .032 .032 .030 .028 .027 .027 .007 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 BM25F Hits-Aut-ID-9 Hits-Aut-IH-15 Grado-Id Grado en IH GRADE IN TODO HITS-AUT-ALL-100 PAGERANK HITS-HUB-ALL-100 HITS-HUB-IH-100 HITS-HIB-ID-100 grados-out-threed-IHGrado-Out-ID aleatorio MRR@10 Figura 2: Efectividad de diferentes caracterÃ­sticas.Busque los tiempos de los discos duros modernos son demasiado lentos para recuperar los enlaces dentro de las limitaciones de tiempo, y el grÃ¡fico no cabe en la memoria principal de una sola mÃ¡quina, incluso cuando se usa las tÃ©cnicas de compresiÃ³n mÃ¡s agresivas. Para experimentar con golpes y otros algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces dependientes de la consulta que requieren accesos no regulares a nodos y bordes arbitrarios en el grÃ¡fico web, implementamos un sistema llamado Tienda Hyperlink escalable, o SHS para abreviar. SHS es una base de datos de uso especial, distribuida sobre un nÃºmero arbitrario de mÃ¡quinas que mantiene una versiÃ³n altamente comprimida del grÃ¡fico web en la memoria y permite una bÃºsqueda muy rÃ¡pida de nodos y bordes. En nuestro hardware, se necesita un promedio de 2 microsegundos para asignar una URL a un mango entero de 64 bits llamado UID, 15 microsegundos para buscar todos los UID entrantes o salientes asociados con una pÃ¡gina UID y 5 microsegundos para mapear un UIDVolver a una URL (la Ãºltima funcionalidad que no se requiere por los Ã©xitos). La sobrecarga de RPC es de aproximadamente 100 microsegundos, pero la API SHS permite que muchas bÃºsquedas se llenen en una sola solicitud de RPC. Implementamos el algoritmo HITS utilizando la infraestructura SHS. Compilamos tres bases de datos SHS, una que contiene los 17.6 mil millones de enlaces en nuestro grÃ¡fico web (todos), uno que contiene solo enlaces entre pÃ¡ginas que se encuentran en diferentes hosts (IH, para interanjado) y uno que contiene solo enlaces entre pÃ¡ginas que estÃ¡n endiferentes dominios (ID). Consideramos que dos URL pertenecen a diferentes hosts si las partes del host de las URL difieren (en otras palabras, no intentamos determinar si dos nombres de host simbÃ³licos distintos se refieren a la misma computadora), y consideramos que un dominio es el nombrecomprado a un registrador (por ejemplo, consideramos que News.bbc.co.uk y www.bbc.co.uk son diferentes anfitriones pertenecientes al mismo dominio). Usando cada una de estas bases de datos, calculamos los puntajes de la autoridad y el concentrador para varias parametrizaciones de los operadores de muestreo, muestras entre 1 y 100 vÃ­nculos posteriores de cada pÃ¡gina en el conjunto de raÃ­ces. Las URL de resultados que no fueron cubiertas por nuestro grÃ¡fico web recibieron automÃ¡ticamente autoridad y puntajes de HUB de 0, ya que no estaban conectados a ningÃºn otro nodo en el grÃ¡fico del vecindario y, por lo tanto, no recibieron ningÃºn endoso. Realizamos cuarenta y cinco cÃ¡lculos de Ã©xitos diferentes, cada uno combinando uno de los tres predicados de selecciÃ³n de enlaces (todos, IH e ID) con un valor de muestreo. Para cada combinaciÃ³n, cargamos una de las tres bases de datos en un sistema SHS que se ejecuta en seis mÃ¡quinas (cada una equipada con 16 GB de RAM), y calculamos los puntajes de la autoridad y el concentrador, una consulta a la vez. La combinaciÃ³n de mÃ¡s larga duraciÃ³n (utilizando todas las bases de datos y muestreo de 100 vÃ­nculos posteriores de cada vÃ©rtice de conjunto de raÃ­z) requiriÃ³ 30,456 segundos para procesar todo el conjunto de consultas, o aproximadamente 1.1 segundos por consulta en promedio.7. Resultados experimentales Para una consulta dada Q, necesitamos clasificar el conjunto de documentos que satisfacen Q (el conjunto de resultados de Q). Nuestra hipÃ³tesis es que las buenas caracterÃ­sticas deberÃ­an poder clasificar los documentos relevantes en este conjunto mÃ¡s alto que los no relevantes, y esto deberÃ­a dar como resultado un aumento en cada medida de rendimiento en el conjunto de consultas. Estamos especÃ­ficamente interesados en evaluar la utilidad de los Ã©xitos y otras caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces. En principio, podrÃ­amos hacer esto clasificando los documentos en cada resultado establecido por su valor de caracterÃ­stica, y comparar los NDCG resultantes. Llamamos a esta clasificaciÃ³n con caracterÃ­sticas aisladas. Primero examinemos el rendimiento relativo de las diferentes parametrizaciones del algoritmo HITS que examinamos. Recuerde que calculamos los Ã©xitos para cada combinaciÃ³n de tres esquemas de secciÃ³n de enlaces: todos los enlaces (todos), enlaces entre anfitriones (IH) y solo enlaces entre dominios (ID), con valores de muestreo de retroceso que van de 1 a 100. La Figura 1 muestra el impacto del nÃºmero de vÃ­nculos posteriores muestreados en el rendimiento de recuperaciÃ³n de los puntajes de autoridad de Ã©xitos. Cada grÃ¡fico estÃ¡ asociado con una medida de rendimiento. El eje horizontal de cada grÃ¡fico representa el nÃºmero de vÃ­nculos posteriores muestreados, el eje vertical representa el rendimiento bajo la medida apropiada y cada curva representa un esquema de selecciÃ³n de enlaces. El esquema de identificaciÃ³n supera ligeramente a IH, y ambos superan enormemente el esquema todo, la eliminaciÃ³n de los enlaces nepotistas vale la pena. El rendimiento de todos los esquemas aumenta a medida que se muestrean mÃ¡s vÃ­nculos de retroceso de cada vÃ©rtice establecido de raÃ­z, mientras que el rendimiento de los esquemas ID e IH alcanza su punto mÃ¡ximo entre 10 y 25 muestras y luego se detiene o incluso disminuyen, dependiendo de la medida de rendimiento. Habiendo comparado diferentes parametrizaciones de golpes, ahora solucionaremos el nÃºmero de enlaces de retroceso muestreados a 100 y compararemos los tres esquemas de selecciÃ³n de enlaces con otras caracterÃ­sticas aisladas: PageRank, Enlaces de conteo en grados y de grado externo de todas las pÃ¡ginas, de diferentes hosts.Solo y solo de diferentes dominios (todos los conjuntos de datos IH e ID respectivamente), y un algoritmo de recuperaciÃ³n de texto que explota texto de anclaje: BM25F [24]. BM25F es una funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n de Ãºltima generaciÃ³n basada Ãºnicamente en el contenido textual de los documentos y sus textos de anclaje asociados. BM25F es un descendiente de BM25 que combina los diferentes campos textuales de un documento, a saber, el tÃ­tulo, el cuerpo y el texto de anclaje. Se ha demostrado que este modelo es una de las funciones de puntuaciÃ³n de bÃºsqueda web con mejor rendimiento en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os [8, 24]. BM25F tiene varios parÃ¡metros libres (2 por campo, 6 en nuestro caso);Utilizamos los valores de parÃ¡metros descritos en [24]..341 .340 .339 .337 .336 .336 .334 .311 .311 .310 .310 .310 .310 .231 0.22 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 grados en ID en IH IH en el grado-Todos los hits-Aut-IH-100 Hits-Aut-All-100 PageRank Hits-Aut-ID-10 Grado-Out-All Hits-Hub-All-100 Grado-IH HITS-HIB-IH-100 GRENDE-id golpea-hub-id-10 BM25F NDCG@10 .152 .152 .151 .150 .150 .149 .149 .137 .136 .136 .128 .127 .127 .100 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0.16 Grado-In-IH Grado en ID Grado en todo Hits-Aut-IH-100 Hits-Aut-All-100 Hits-Aut-ID-10 PageRank Hits-Hub-All-100 Grado-IH Hits-HUB-ID-ID-100 Grado-Out-todo Grado-ID HITS-HUB-IH-100 BM25F MAP@10 .398 .397 .394 .394 .392 .392 .391 .356 .356 .356 .356 .356 .356.355 .273 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 grados In-ID Grado en IH Grado en todo Hits-Aut-IH-100 Hits-Aut-All-100 Pagerank Hits-Aut-ID-10 Grado-Out-Out-Out-OutHITS-HUB-ALL-ALL-100 grados-IH HITS-HUB-IH-100 grados-ID HITS-HUB-ID-10 BM25F MRR@10 Figura 3: Medidas de efectividad para combinaciones lineales de caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces con BM25F. La Figura 2 muestra las medidas NDCG, MRR y MAP de estas caracterÃ­sticas. Nuevamente, todas las medidas de rendimiento (y para todos los umbrales de rango que exploramos) estÃ¡n de acuerdo. Como se esperaba, BM25F supera todas las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces por un gran margen. Las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en el enlace se dividen en dos grupos, con una notable caÃ­da de rendimiento entre los grupos. El grupo de mejor rendimiento consiste en las caracterÃ­sticas que se basan en el nÃºmero y/o la calidad de los enlaces entrantes (puntajes de autoridad en el grado, PageRank y llegan a la autoridad);Y el grupo de peor desempeÃ±o consiste en las caracterÃ­sticas que se basan en el nÃºmero y/o la calidad de los enlaces salientes (puntajes Outdegree and Hits Hub). En el grupo de caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces entrantes, las caracterÃ­sticas que ignoran los enlaces nepotistas funcionan mejor que sus contrapartes utilizando todos los enlaces. AdemÃ¡s, usar solo enlaces entre dominios (ID) parece ser marginalmente mejor que usar enlaces intermedentes (IH). El hecho de que las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces salientes tengan un rendimiento inferior a las basadas en enlaces entrantes coinciden con nuestras expectativas;En todo caso, es un poco sorprendente que los enlaces salientes proporcionen una seÃ±al Ãºtil para la clasificaciÃ³n. Por otro lado, el hecho de que las caracterÃ­sticas en el grado superan a PageRank en todas las medidas es bastante sorprendente. Una posible explicaciÃ³n es que los spammers de enlaces han estado apuntando al algoritmo de PageRank publicado durante muchos aÃ±os, y que esto ha llevado a anomalÃ­as en el grÃ¡fico web que afectan a PageRank, pero no a otras caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces que exploran solo un vecindario a distancia 1 deel conjunto de resultados. Del mismo modo, es sorprendente que las caracterÃ­sticas simples independientes de la consulta, como en el grado, que podrÃ­an estimar la calidad global pero no pueden capturar la relevancia para una consulta, superarÃ­an las caracterÃ­sticas dependientes de la consulta, como los puntajes de autoridad de los Ã©xitos. Sin embargo, no podemos investigar el efecto de estas caracterÃ­sticas de forma aislada, sin tener en cuenta la funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n general, por varias razones. Primero, las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en el contenido textual de los documentos (a diferencia de las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces) son los mejores predictores de relevancia. En segundo lugar, las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces se pueden correlacionar fuertemente con las caracterÃ­sticas textuales por varias razones, principalmente la correlaciÃ³n entre la funciÃ³n de transformaciÃ³n de numerosas y numerosas BM25F T (S) = S PageRank T (S) = log (S + 3 Â· 10-12-12) Grado-In-* t (s) = log (S + 3 Â· 10âˆ’2) Grado-Out-* t (S) = log (S + 3 Â· 103) Hits-Aut-* t (S) = log(S + 3 Â· 10âˆ’8) HITS-HUB-* T (S) = log (S + 3 Â· 10âˆ’1) Tabla 1: Funciones de transformaciÃ³n de caracterÃ­sticas casi Ã³ptimas.ber de coincidencias de anclaje textual. Por lo tanto, uno debe considerar el efecto de las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces en combinaciÃ³n con caracterÃ­sticas textuales. De lo contrario, podemos encontrar una caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces que es muy buena de forma aislada, pero que estÃ© fuertemente correlacionada con las caracterÃ­sticas textuales y los resultados no tienen una mejora general;Y viceversa, podemos encontrar una caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces que es dÃ©bil de forma aislada pero que mejora significativamente el rendimiento general. Por esta razÃ³n, hemos estudiado la combinaciÃ³n de las funciones basadas en enlaces anteriores con BM25F. Todas las combinaciones de caracterÃ­sticas se realizaron considerando la combinaciÃ³n lineal de dos caracterÃ­sticas como puntaje de documento, utilizando la puntuaciÃ³n de fÃ³rmula (d) = Pn i = 1 witi (fi (d)), donde d es un documento (o par de documentos, en elEl caso de BM25F), Fi (D) (para 1 â‰¤ I â‰¤ n) es una caracterÃ­stica extraÃ­da de D, Ti es una transformaciÃ³n y WI es un peso escalar libre que debe ajustarse. Elegimos funciones de transformaciÃ³n que empÃ­ricamente determinamos que son adecuados. La Tabla 1 muestra las funciones de transformaciÃ³n elegidas. Este tipo de combinaciÃ³n lineal es apropiada si suponemos que las caracterÃ­sticas son independientes con respecto a la relevancia y un modelo exponencial para las caracterÃ­sticas de enlace, como se discute en [8]. Sintonizamos los pesos seleccionando un subconjunto aleatorio de 5,000 consultas del conjunto de consultas, utilizamos un proceso de refinamiento iterativo para encontrar pesos que maximizaran una medida de rendimiento dada en ese conjunto de entrenamiento y utilizÃ³ las 23.043 consultas restantes para medir el rendimiento de la derivada asÃ­ derivada.Funciones de puntuaciÃ³n. Exploramos la combinaciÃ³n por pares de BM25F con cada funciÃ³n de puntuaciÃ³n basada en enlaces. La Figura 3 muestra las medidas de NDCG, MRR y MAP de estas combinaciones de caracterÃ­sticas, junto con una puntuaciÃ³n BM25F basal (la barra mÃ¡s derecha en cada grÃ¡fico), que se calculÃ³ utilizando el mismo subconjunto de 23,045 consultas que se usaron como conjunto de prueba.Para las combinaciones de caracterÃ­sticas. Independientemente de la medida de rendimiento aplicada, podemos hacer las siguientes observaciones generales: 1. La combinaciÃ³n de cualquiera de las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces con BM25F da como resultado una mejora sustancial del rendimiento sobre BM25F de forma aislada.2. La combinaciÃ³n de BM25F con caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces entrantes (PageRank, en grado y puntajes de autoridad) funciona sustancialmente mejor que la combinaciÃ³n con caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces salientes (golpea las puntuaciones del centro y el grado externo).3. Las diferencias de rendimiento entre las diversas combinaciones de BM25F con caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces entrantes son relativamente pequeÃ±as, y el ordenamiento relativo de las combinaciones de caracterÃ­sticas es bastante estable en el 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 6 10 12 16 18 20 20 20 20 2022 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 BM25FNORM PAGERANK GRADO-ID HITS-AUT-ID-100 Figura 4: Medidas de efectividad para caracterÃ­sticas aisladas seleccionadas, desglosada por especificidad de la pregunta.Ferentes medidas de rendimiento utilizadas. Sin embargo, la combinaciÃ³n de BM25F con cualquier variante en el grado, y en particular con ID en el grado, supera constantemente la combinaciÃ³n de BM25F con PageRank o Hits Stands de autoridad, y se puede calcular mucho mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil y mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido. Finalmente, investigamos si ciertas caracterÃ­sticas son mejores para algunas consultas que para otras. Particularmente, estamos interesados en la relaciÃ³n entre la especificidad de una consulta y el rendimiento de diferentes caracterÃ­sticas de clasificaciÃ³n. La medida mÃ¡s directa de la especificidad de una consulta Q serÃ­a el nÃºmero de documentos en un corpus de motores de bÃºsqueda que satisfacen Q. Desafortunadamente, el conjunto de consultas disponible para nosotros no contenÃ­a esta informaciÃ³n. Por lo tanto, elegimos aproximar la especificidad de Q resumiendo las frecuencias de documentos inversas de los tÃ©rminos de consulta individuales que comprenden Q. La frecuencia de documento inversa (IDF) de un tÃ©rmino T con respecto a un corpus C se define como logn/doc (t), donde Doc (t) es el nÃºmero de documentos en C que contienen T y N es el nÃºmero total de documentosEn C. resumiendo los IDF de los tÃ©rminos de la consulta, hacemos la suposiciÃ³n (defectuosa) de que los tÃ©rminos de consulta individuales son independientes entre sÃ­. Sin embargo, aunque no es perfecta, esta aproximaciÃ³n es al menos direccionalmente correcta. Desglosamos nuestra consulta establecida en 13 cubos, cada cubo asociado con un intervalo de valores de IDF de consulta, y calculamos las mÃ©tricas de rendimiento para todas las funciones de clasificaciÃ³n aplicadas (de forma aislada) a las consultas en cada cubo. Para mantener legibles los grÃ¡ficos, no mostraremos el rendimiento de todas las caracterÃ­sticas, sino que nos restringiremos a los cuatro mÃ¡s interesantes: PageRank, ID alcanza los puntajes de autoridad, ID en grado y BM25F. La Figura 4 muestra el mapa@10 para los 13 cubos de especificidad de consulta. Los cubos en el extremo izquierdo de cada grÃ¡fico representan consultas muy generales;Los cubos en el extremo derecho representan consultas muy especÃ­ficas. Las figuras en el eje X superior de cada grÃ¡fico muestran el nÃºmero de consultas en cada cubo (por ejemplo, el cubo mÃ¡s derecho contiene 1.629 consultas). BM25F funciona mejor para consultas especÃ­ficas de mediana, alcanzando su punto mÃ¡ximo en los cubos que representan el intervalo de suma de las FDI [12,14). En comparaciÃ³n, alcanza los picos en el cubo que representa el intervalo de suma de las FDI [4,6), y PageRank y Pico en grados en el cubo que representa el intervalo [6,8), es decir, consultas mÃ¡s generales.8. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro Este documento describe una evaluaciÃ³n a gran escala de la efectividad de los hits en comparaciÃ³n con otros algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces, en particular PageRank y en grados, cuando se aplica de forma aislada o en combinaciÃ³n con un algoritmo de recuperaciÃ³n de texto que explota el texto de anclaje(BM25F). La evaluaciÃ³n se lleva a cabo con respecto a una gran cantidad de consultas evaluadas humanas, utilizando tres medidas diferentes de efectividad: NDCG, MRR y MAP. EvaluaciÃ³n de las caracterÃ­sticas basadas en enlaces de forma aislada, encontramos que la pÃ¡gina web en el grado supera a PageRank, y es tan efectivo como los puntajes de la autoridad. Los puntajes de HIT HUB y la pÃ¡gina web fuera del grado son caracterÃ­sticas de clasificaciÃ³n mucho menos efectivas, pero aÃºn superan a un orden aleatorio. Una combinaciÃ³n lineal de cualquier caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces con BM25F produce una mejora significativa en el rendimiento, y existe una clara diferencia entre la combinaciÃ³n de BM25F con una caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces entrantes (puntajes de autoridad Indegree, Pagerank o Hits) y una caracterÃ­stica basada en salientes salientes.Enlaces (llega a las puntuaciones de HUB y un grado externo), pero dentro de esos dos grupos, la elecciÃ³n precisa de la caracterÃ­stica basada en enlaces es importante relativamente poco. Creemos que las mediciones presentadas en este documento proporcionan una evaluaciÃ³n sÃ³lida de los esquemas de clasificaciÃ³n mÃ¡s conocidos basados en enlaces. Hay muchas variantes posibles de estos esquemas, y se han propuesto muchos otros algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces en la literatura, por lo tanto, no reclamamos que este trabajo sea la Ãºltima palabra sobre este tema, sino el primer paso en un camino largo. El trabajo futuro incluye la evaluaciÃ³n de diferentes parametrizaciones de PageRank y Hits. En particular, nos gustarÃ­a estudiar el impacto de los cambios en el factor de amortiguaciÃ³n de PageRank sobre la efectividad, el impacto de varios esquemas destinados a contrarrestar los efectos del spam de enlace y el efecto de pesar hipervÃ­nculos de manera diferente dependiendo de si son nepotistas o no. Yendo mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de PageRank y Hits, nos gustarÃ­a medir la efectividad de otros algoritmos de clasificaciÃ³n basados en enlaces, como la salsa. Finalmente, planeamos experimentar con combinaciones de caracterÃ­sticas mÃ¡s complejas.9. Referencias [1] B. Amento, L. Terveen y W. Hill. Â¿La autoridad significa calidad?

        "Marc Najork Microsoft Research 1065 La Avenida Mountain View, CA, USA najork@microsoft.com Hugo Zaragoza âˆ— Yahoo!",
        "Research Barcelona Ocata 1 Barcelona 08003, Spain hugoz@es.yahoo-inc.com Michael Taylor Microsoft Research 7 J J Thompson Ave Cambridge CB3 0FB, UK mitaylor@microsoft.com ABSTRACT This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a state-ofthe-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
        "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
        "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
        "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
        "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
        "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Storage and Retrieval-search process, selection process General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
        "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
        "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
        "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
        "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
        "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
        "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
        "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
        "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
        "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
        "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
        "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
        "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
        "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
        "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
        "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
        "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.",
        "Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
        "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
        "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
        "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
        "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
        "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
        "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
        "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
        "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
        "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
        "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
        "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
        "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
        "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
        "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
        "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
        "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
        "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
        "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
        "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
        "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
        "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
        "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
        "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
        "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
        "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
        "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
        "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
        "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
        "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
        "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
        "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
        "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
        "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
        "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
        "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
        "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
        "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
        "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
        "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
        "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
        "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
        "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
        "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
        "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
        "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
        "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
        "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
        "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
        "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
        "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
        "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
        "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
        "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
        "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
        "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
        "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
        "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
        "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
        "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
        "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
        "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
        "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
        "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
        "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
        "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
        "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
        "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
        "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
        "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
        "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
        "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
        "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
        "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
        "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
        "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
        "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
        "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
        "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
        "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
        "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
        "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
        "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
        "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
        "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm.",
        "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
        "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
        "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
        "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
        "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",
        "Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B.",
        "In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate.",
        "Given a set A, the notation Sn[A] draws n elements uniformly at random from A; Sn[A] = A if |A| â‰¤ n. A link section predicate P takes an edge (u, v) âˆˆ E. In this study, we use the following three link section predicates: all(u, v) â‡” true ih(u, v) â‡” host(u) = host(v) id(u, v) â‡” domain(u) = domain(v) where host(u) denotes the host of URL u, and domain(u) denotes the domain of URL u.",
        "So, all is true for all links, whereas ih is true only for inter-host links, and id is true only for inter-domain links.",
        "The outlinked-set OP of the root set R w.r.t. a linkselection predicate P is defined to be: OP = [ uâˆˆR {v âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)} The inlinking-set IP s of the root set R w.r.t. a link-selection predicate P and a sampling value s is defined to be: IP s = [ vâˆˆR Ss[{u âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)}] The base set BP s of the root set R w.r.t.",

        "For each node u in the neighborhood graph, HITS computes two scores: an authority score A(u), estimating how authoritative u is on the topic induced by the query, and a hub score H(u), indicating whether u is a good reference to many authoritative pages.",

        "In order to experiment with HITS and other query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms that require non-regular accesses to arbitrary nodes and edges in the web graph, we implemented a system called the Scalable Hyperlink Store, or SHS for short.",
        "SHS is a special-purpose database, distributed over an arbitrary number of machines that keeps a highly compressed version of the web graph in memory and allows very fast lookup of nodes and edges.",
        "On our hardware, it takes an average of 2 microseconds to map a URL to a 64-bit integer handle called a UID, 15 microseconds to look up all incoming or outgoing link UIDs associated with a page UID, and 5 microseconds to map a UID back to a URL (the last functionality not being required by HITS).",
        "The RPC overhead is about 100 microseconds, but the SHS API allows many lookups to be batched into a single RPC request.",
        "We implemented the HITS algorithm using the SHS infrastructure.",
        "We compiled three SHS databases, one containing all 17.6 billion links in our web graph (all), one containing only links between pages that are on different hosts (ih, for inter-host), and one containing only links between pages that are on different domains (id).",
        "We consider two URLs to belong to different hosts if the host portions of the URLs differ (in other words, we make no attempt to determine whether two distinct symbolic host names refer to the same computer), and we consider a domain to be the name purchased from a registrar (for example, we consider news.bbc.co.uk and www.bbc.co.uk to be different hosts belonging to the same domain).",
        "Using each of these databases, we computed HITS authority and hub scores for various parameterizations of the sampling operator S, sampling between 1 and 100 back-links of each page in the root set.",
        "Result URLs that were not covered by our web graph automatically received authority and hub scores of 0, since they were not connected to any other nodes in the neighborhood graph and therefore did not receive any endorsements.",
        "We performed forty-five different HITS computations, each combining one of the three link selection predicates (all, ih, and id) with a sampling value.",
        "For each combination, we loaded one of the three databases into an SHS system running on six machines (each equipped with 16 GB of RAM), and computed HITS authority and hub scores, one query at a time.",
        "The longest-running combination (using the all database and sampling 100 back-links of each root set vertex) required 30,456 seconds to process the entire query set, or about 1.1 seconds per query on average. 7.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS For a given query Q, we need to rank the set of documents satisfying Q (the result set of Q).",
        "Our hypothesis is that good features should be able to rank relevant documents in this set higher than non-relevant ones, and this should result in an increase in each performance measure over the query set.",
        "We are specifically interested in evaluating the usefulness of HITS and other link-based features.",
        "In principle, we could do this by sorting the documents in each result set by their feature value, and compare the resulting NDCGs.",
        "We call this ranking with isolated features.",
        "Let us first examine the relative performance of the different parameterizations of the HITS algorithm we examined.",
        "Recall that we computed HITS for each combination of three link section schemes - all links (all), inter-host links only (ih), and inter-domain links only (id) - with back-link sampling values ranging from 1 to 100.",
        "Figure 1 shows the impact of the number of sampled back-links on the retrieval performance of HITS authority scores.",
        "Each graph is associated with one performance measure.",
        "The horizontal axis of each graph represents the number of sampled back-links, the vertical axis represents performance under the appropriate measure, and each curve depicts a link selection scheme.",
        "The id scheme slightly outperforms ih, and both vastly outperform the all scheme - eliminating nepotistic links pays off.",
        "The performance of the all scheme increases as more back-links of each root set vertex are sampled, while the performance of the id and ih schemes peaks at between 10 and 25 samples and then plateaus or even declines, depending on the performance measure.",
        "Having compared different parameterizations of HITS, we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100 and compare the three link selection schemes against other isolated features: PageRank, in-degree and out-degree counting links of all pages, of different hosts only and of different domains only (all, ih and id datasets respectively), and a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text: BM25F[24].",
        "BM25F is a state-of-the art ranking function solely based on textual content of the documents and their associated anchor texts.",
        "BM25F is a descendant of BM25 that combines the different textual fields of a document, namely title, body and anchor text.",
        "This model has been shown to be one of the best-performing web search scoring functions over the last few years [8, 24].",

        "Figure 2 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these features.",
        "Again all performance measures (and for all rank-thresholds we explored) agree.",
        "As expected, BM25F outperforms all link-based features by a large margin.",
        "The link-based features are divided into two groups, with a noticeable performance drop between the groups.",
        "The better-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of incoming links (in-degree, PageRank, and HITS authority scores); and the worse-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of outgoing links (outdegree and HITS hub scores).",
        "In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links.",
        "Moreover, using only inter-domain (id) links seems to be marginally better than using inter-host (ih) links.",
        "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
        "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
        "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
        "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
        "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
        "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",
        "Second, link-based features can be strongly correlated with textual features for several reasons, mainly the correlation between in-degree and numFeature Transform function bm25f T(s) = s pagerank T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’12 ) degree-in-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’2 ) degree-out-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 103 ) hits-aut-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’8 ) hits-hub-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’1 ) Table 1: Near-optimal feature transform functions. ber of textual anchor matches.",
        "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
        "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
        "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
        "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
        "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
        "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
        "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
        "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
        "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
        "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
        "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
        "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
        "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",
        "The performance differences between the various combinations of BM25F with features based on incoming links is comparatively small, and the relative ordering of feature combinations is fairly stable across the 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 bm25fnorm pagerank degree-in-id hits-aut-id-100 Figure 4: Effectiveness measures for selected isolated features, broken down by query specificity. ferent performance measures used.",
        "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
        "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
        "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
        "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
        "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
        "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
        "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
        "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
        "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
        "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
        "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
        "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
        "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
        "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
        "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",
        "Evaluation is carried out with respect to a large number of human evaluated queries, using three different measures of effectiveness: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
        "Evaluating link-based features in isolation, we found that web page in-degree outperforms PageRank, and is about as effwective as HITS authority scores.",
        "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
        "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
        "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
        "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
        "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
        "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",
        "Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.",
        "Finally, we are planning to experiment with more complex feature combinations. 9.",

                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
                "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Storage and Retrieval-search process, selection process General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is <br>ranking</br> at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",

                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for <br>ranking</br> web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based <br>ranking</br> algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based <br>ranking</br> algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing <br>ranking</br> algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various <br>ranking</br> algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect <br>ranking</br> scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a <br>ranking</br> by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-<br>ranking</br> relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-<br>ranking</br> results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial <br>ranking</br> algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
                "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
                "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
                "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
                "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent <br>ranking</br> algorithm.",
                "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
                "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
                "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",
                "Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B.",
                "In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate.",
                "Given a set A, the notation Sn[A] draws n elements uniformly at random from A; Sn[A] = A if |A| â‰¤ n. A link section predicate P takes an edge (u, v) âˆˆ E. In this study, we use the following three link section predicates: all(u, v) â‡” true ih(u, v) â‡” host(u) = host(v) id(u, v) â‡” domain(u) = domain(v) where host(u) denotes the host of URL u, and domain(u) denotes the domain of URL u.",
                "So, all is true for all links, whereas ih is true only for inter-host links, and id is true only for inter-domain links.",

                "For each node u in the neighborhood graph, HITS computes two scores: an authority score A(u), estimating how authoritative u is on the topic induced by the query, and a hub score H(u), indicating whether u is a good reference to many authoritative pages.",
                "This is done using the following algorithm: 1.",

                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",

                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different <br>ranking</br> features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",

By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all <br>ranking</br> functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",

                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms <br>pagerank</br>, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
                "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",

                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and <br>pagerank</br> have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to <br>pagerank</br> or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",

                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and <br>pagerank</br> [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses <br>pagerank</br>, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and <br>pagerank</br>.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by <br>pagerank</br> include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and <br>pagerank</br>.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of <br>pagerank</br>, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of <br>pagerank</br> scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of <br>pagerank</br> and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of <br>pagerank</br>.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",

                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",

                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and <br>pagerank</br> and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular <br>pagerank</br> and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, <br>pagerank</br>, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of <br>pagerank</br> and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the <br>pagerank</br> damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the <br>mean reciprocal rank</br>, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",

                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",

                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",

                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
                "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",

                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",

                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links.",

                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",

                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",

                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",

                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",

                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",

                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",

                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",

                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",

                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",

                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",

                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",

                "Let us first examine the relative performance of the different parameterizations of the HITS algorithm we examined.",
                "Recall that we computed HITS for each combination of three link section schemes - all links (all), inter-host links only (ih), and inter-domain links only (id) - with back-link sampling values ranging from 1 to 100.",

                "The performance of the all scheme increases as more back-links of each root set vertex are sampled, while the performance of the id and ih schemes peaks at between 10 and 25 samples and then plateaus or even declines, depending on the performance measure.",
                "Having compared different parameterizations of HITS, we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100 and compare the three link selection schemes against other isolated features: PageRank, in-degree and out-degree counting links of all pages, of different hosts only and of different domains only (all, ih and id datasets respectively), and a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text: BM25F[24].",

                "In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links.",
                "Moreover, using only inter-domain (id) links seems to be marginally better than using inter-host (ih) links.",
                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",
                "Second, link-based features can be strongly correlated with textual features for several reasons, mainly the correlation between in-degree and numFeature Transform function bm25f T(s) = s pagerank T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’12 ) degree-in-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’2 ) degree-out-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 103 ) hits-aut-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’8 ) hits-hub-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’1 ) Table 1: Near-optimal feature transform functions. ber of textual anchor matches.",
                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
                "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",

                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 <br>query specificity</br> buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.",
                "Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
                "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
                "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
                "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
                "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm.",
                "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
                "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
                "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",
                "Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B.",
                "In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate.",

                "We consider two URLs to belong to different hosts if the host portions of the URLs differ (in other words, we make no attempt to determine whether two distinct symbolic host names refer to the same computer), and we consider a domain to be the name purchased from a registrar (for example, we consider news.bbc.co.uk and www.bbc.co.uk to be different hosts belonging to the same domain).",
                "Using each of these databases, we computed HITS authority and hub scores for various parameterizations of the sampling operator S, sampling between 1 and 100 back-links of each page in the root set.",

                "For each combination, we loaded one of the three databases into an SHS system running on six machines (each equipped with 16 GB of RAM), and computed HITS authority and hub scores, one query at a time.",

                "Our hypothesis is that good features should be able to rank relevant documents in this set higher than non-relevant ones, and this should result in an increase in each performance measure over the query set.",
                "We are specifically interested in evaluating the usefulness of HITS and other link-based features.",
                "In principle, we could do this by sorting the documents in each result set by their feature value, and compare the resulting NDCGs.",
                "We call this ranking with isolated features.",
                "Let us first examine the relative performance of the different parameterizations of the HITS algorithm we examined.",
                "Recall that we computed HITS for each combination of three link section schemes - all links (all), inter-host links only (ih), and inter-domain links only (id) - with back-link sampling values ranging from 1 to 100.",

                "The performance of the all scheme increases as more back-links of each root set vertex are sampled, while the performance of the id and ih schemes peaks at between 10 and 25 samples and then plateaus or even declines, depending on the performance measure.",
                "Having compared different parameterizations of HITS, we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100 and compare the three link selection schemes against other isolated features: PageRank, in-degree and out-degree counting links of all pages, of different hosts only and of different domains only (all, ih and id datasets respectively), and a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text: BM25F[24].",

                "The link-based features are divided into two groups, with a noticeable performance drop between the groups.",
                "The better-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of incoming links (in-degree, PageRank, and HITS authority scores); and the worse-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of outgoing links (outdegree and HITS hub scores).",
                "In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links.",
                "Moreover, using only inter-domain (id) links seems to be marginally better than using inter-host (ih) links.",
                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",
                "Second, link-based features can be strongly correlated with textual features for several reasons, mainly the correlation between in-degree and numFeature Transform function bm25f T(s) = s pagerank T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’12 ) degree-in-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’2 ) degree-out-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 103 ) hits-aut-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’8 ) hits-hub-* T(s) = log(s + 3 Â· 10âˆ’1 ) Table 1: Near-optimal feature transform functions. ber of textual anchor matches.",
                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
                "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",
                "The performance differences between the various combinations of BM25F with features based on incoming links is comparatively small, and the relative ordering of feature combinations is fairly stable across the 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 bm25fnorm pagerank degree-in-id hits-aut-id-100 Figure 4: Effectiveness measures for selected isolated features, broken down by query specificity. ferent performance measures used.",
                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",
                "Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.",

                "Using each of these databases, we computed HITS authority and hub scores for various parameterizations of the sampling operator S, sampling between 1 and 100 back-links of each page in the root set.",
                "Result URLs that were not covered by our web graph automatically received authority and hub scores of 0, since they were not connected to any other nodes in the neighborhood graph and therefore did not receive any endorsements.",

                "For each combination, we loaded one of the three databases into an SHS system running on six machines (each equipped with 16 GB of RAM), and computed HITS authority and hub scores, one query at a time.",

                "Our hypothesis is that good features should be able to rank relevant documents in this set higher than non-relevant ones, and this should result in an increase in each performance measure over the query set.",
                "We are specifically interested in evaluating the usefulness of HITS and other link-based features.",
                "In principle, we could do this by sorting the documents in each result set by their feature value, and compare the resulting NDCGs.",
                "We call this ranking with isolated features.",
                "Let us first examine the relative performance of the different parameterizations of the HITS algorithm we examined.",
                "Recall that we computed HITS for each combination of three link section schemes - all links (all), inter-host links only (ih), and inter-domain links only (id) - with back-link sampling values ranging from 1 to 100.",

                "The performance of the all scheme increases as more back-links of each root set vertex are sampled, while the performance of the id and ih schemes peaks at between 10 and 25 samples and then plateaus or even declines, depending on the performance measure.",
                "Having compared different parameterizations of HITS, we will now fix the number of sampled back-links at 100 and compare the three link selection schemes against other isolated features: PageRank, in-degree and out-degree counting links of all pages, of different hosts only and of different domains only (all, ih and id datasets respectively), and a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text: BM25F[24].",

                "The link-based features are divided into two groups, with a noticeable performance drop between the groups.",
                "The better-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of incoming links (in-degree, PageRank, and HITS authority scores); and the worse-performing group consists of the features that are based on the number and/or quality of outgoing links (outdegree and HITS hub scores).",
                "In the group of features based on incoming links, features that ignore nepotistic links perform better than their counterparts using all links.",
                "Moreover, using only inter-domain (id) links seems to be marginally better than using inter-host (ih) links.",
                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and MAP measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
                "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",
                "The performance differences between the various combinations of BM25F with features based on incoming links is comparatively small, and the relative ordering of feature combinations is fairly stable across the 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 bm25fnorm pagerank degree-in-id hits-aut-id-100 Figure 4: Effectiveness measures for selected isolated features, broken down by query specificity. ferent performance measures used.",
                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "Research Barcelona Ocata 1 Barcelona 08003, Spain hugoz@es.yahoo-inc.com Michael Taylor Microsoft Research 7 J J Thompson Ave Cambridge CB3 0FB, UK mitaylor@microsoft.com ABSTRACT This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, when used in combination with a state-ofthe-art text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
                "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Storage and Retrieval-search process, selection process General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: <br>scale and relevance</br>.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.",
                "Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
                "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
                "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
                "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
                "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm.",
                "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
                "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
                "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",
                "Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B.",
                "In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate.",
                "Given a set A, the notation Sn[A] draws n elements uniformly at random from A; Sn[A] = A if |A| â‰¤ n. A link section predicate P takes an edge (u, v) âˆˆ E. In this study, we use the following three link section predicates: all(u, v) â‡” true ih(u, v) â‡” host(u) = host(v) id(u, v) â‡” domain(u) = domain(v) where host(u) denotes the host of URL u, and domain(u) denotes the domain of URL u.",
                "So, all is true for all links, whereas ih is true only for inter-host links, and id is true only for inter-domain links.",
                "The outlinked-set OP of the root set R w.r.t. a linkselection predicate P is defined to be: OP = [ uâˆˆR {v âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)} The inlinking-set IP s of the root set R w.r.t. a link-selection predicate P and a sampling value s is defined to be: IP s = [ vâˆˆR Ss[{u âˆˆ V : (u, v) âˆˆ E âˆ§ P(u, v)}] The base set BP s of the root set R w.r.t.",

                "For each node u in the neighborhood graph, HITS computes two scores: an authority score A(u), estimating how authoritative u is on the topic induced by the query, and a hub score H(u), indicating whether u is a good reference to many authoritative pages.",
                "This is done using the following algorithm: 1.",
                "For all u âˆˆ B do H(u) := q 1 |B| , A(u) := q 1 |B| . 2.",

                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",

                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",

                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",

                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent <br>link-based feature</br>.",

                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
                "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
                "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
                "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
                "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm.",
                "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
                "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
                "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",
                "Given a web graph (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E âŠ† V Ã— V , and the set of result URLs to a query (called the root set R âŠ† V ) as input, HITS computes a neighborhood graph consisting of a base set B âŠ† V (the root set and some of its neighboring vertices) and some of the edges in E induced by B.",
                "In order to formalize the definition of the neighborhood graph, it is helpful to first introduce a sampling operator and the concept of a linkselection predicate.",
                "Given a set A, the notation Sn[A] draws n elements uniformly at random from A; Sn[A] = A if |A| â‰¤ n. A link section predicate P takes an edge (u, v) âˆˆ E. In this study, we use the following three link section predicates: all(u, v) â‡” true ih(u, v) â‡” host(u) = host(v) id(u, v) â‡” domain(u) = domain(v) where host(u) denotes the host of URL u, and domain(u) denotes the domain of URL u.",

                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",

                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",

                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",

                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",

                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",

                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",

                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",
                "A post-processing phase uses the final PageRank vectors (one per machine) and the table mapping URLs to 32-bit integers (representing indices into each PageRank vector) to score the result URL in our query log.",
                "As mentioned above, our web graph covered 9,525,566 of the 66,846,214 result URLs.",
                "These URLs were annotated with their computed PageRank score; all other URLs received a score of 0. 6.",
                "HITS HITS, unlike PageRank, is a query-dependent ranking algorithm.",
                "HITS (which stands for Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is based on the following two intuitions: First, hyperlinks can be viewed as topical endorsements: A hyperlink from a page u devoted to topic T to another page v is likely to endorse the authority of v with respect to topic T. Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",

                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",

                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",

                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",

                "Amento et al. [1] employed <br>quantitative measure</br>s, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",

                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",

Second, the result set of a particular query is likely to have a certain amount of topical coherence.",
                "Therefore, it makes sense to perform link analysis not on the entire web graph, but rather on just the neighborhood of pages contained in the result set, since this neighborhood is more likely to contain topically relevant links.",
                "But while the set of nodes immediately reachable from the result set is manageable (given that most pages have only a limited number of hyperlinks embedded into them), the set of pages immediately leading to the result set can be enormous.",
                "For this reason, Kleinberg suggests sampling a fixed-size random subset of the pages linking to any high-indegree page in the result set.",
                "Moreover, Kleinberg suggests considering only links that cross host boundaries, the rationale being that links between pages on the same host (intrinsic links) are likely to be navigational or nepotistic and not topically relevant.",

                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",

                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",

                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of <br>crawled web page</br>s is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",
                "We used a three-machine cluster, each machine equipped with 16 GB of RAM, to compute standard PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion URLs that were contained in our web graph.",
                "We used a damping factor of 0.15, and performed 200 power iterations.",
                "Starting at iteration 165, the Lâˆž norm of the change in the PageRank vector from one iteration to the next had stopped decreasing, indicating that we had reached as much of a fixed point as the limitations of 64-bit floating point arithmetic would allow. 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result NDCG@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MAP@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 1 10 100 Number of back-links sampled per result MRR@10 hits-aut-all hits-aut-ih hits-aut-id Figure 1: Effectiveness of authority scores computed using different parameterizations of HITS.",

                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",

                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents <br>rank</br> increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest <br>rank</br>).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular <br>rank</br>-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at <br>rank</br> j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal <br>rank</br> (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the <br>rank</br> of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at <br>rank</br>-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal <br>rank</br> (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal <br>rank</br> of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at <br>rank</br> i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at <br>rank</br> j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at <br>rank</br>-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of <br>rank</br>-thresholds; we report results here at <br>rank</br> 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the <br>rank</br> may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
                "Since over 80% of all hyperlinks on the web are relative (that is, are between two pages on the same host), this property greatly reduces the amount of network communication required by the second stage of the distributed scoring computation.",
                "The second phase performs the actual PageRank power iteration.",
                "Both the link data and the current PageRank vector reside on disk and are read in a streaming fashion; while the new PageRank vector is maintained in memory.",
                "We represent PageRank scores as 64-bit floating point numbers.",
                "PageRank contributions to pages assigned to remote machines are streamed to the remote machine via a TCP connection.",

                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",

                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",

                "The performance differences between the various combinations of BM25F with features based on incoming links is comparatively small, and the relative ordering of feature combinations is fairly stable across the 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 MAP@10 26 374 1640 2751 3768 4284 3944 3001 2617 1871 1367 771 1629 bm25fnorm pagerank degree-in-id <br>hit</br>s-aut-id-100 Figure 4: Effectiveness measures for selected isolated features, broken down by query specificity. ferent performance measures used.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",

                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",

                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",

                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with <br>bm25f</br>.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of <br>bm25f</br>), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",

                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with <br>bm25f</br> results in a substantial performance improvement over <br>bm25f</br> in isolation. 2.",

                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and <br>bm25f</br>.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",

                "A linear combination of any link-based features with <br>bm25f</br> produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining <br>bm25f</br> with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
                "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Storage and Retrieval-search process, selection process General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.",
                "Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: NDCG, <br>mrr</br>, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "NDCG values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the NDCG of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The NDCG is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean NDCG.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (<br>mrr</br>) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of <br>mrr</br> and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and <br>mrr</br> values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed NDCG, MAP, and <br>mrr</br> values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",

                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the MAP@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",
                "Evaluation is carried out with respect to a large number of human evaluated queries, using three different measures of effectiveness: NDCG, <br>mrr</br>, and MAP.",
                "Evaluating link-based features in isolation, we found that web page in-degree outperforms PageRank, and is about as effwective as HITS authority scores.",
                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",
                "Future work includes evaluation of different parameterizations of PageRank and HITS.",
                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",
                "Going beyond PageRank and HITS, we would like to measure the effectiveness of other link-based ranking algorithms, such as SALSA.",

                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",

                "The fact that features based on outgoing links underperform those based on incoming links matches our expectations; if anything, it is mildly surprising that outgoing links provide a useful signal for ranking at all.",
                "On the other hand, the fact that in-degree features outperform PageRank under all measures is quite surprising.",
                "A possible explanation is that link-spammers have been targeting the published PageRank algorithm for many years, and that this has led to anomalies in the web graph that affect PageRank, but not other link-based features that explore only a distance-1 neighborhood of the result set.",
                "Likewise, it is surprising that simple query-independent features such as in-degree, which might estimate global quality but cannot capture relevance to a query, would outperform query-dependent features such as HITS authority scores.",
                "However, we cannot investigate the effect of these features in isolation, without regard to the overall ranking function, for several reasons.",
                "First, features based on the textual content of documents (as opposed to link-based features) are the best predictors of relevance.",

                "Therefore, one must consider the effect of link-based features in combination with textual features.",
                "Otherwise, we may find a link-based feature that is very good in isolation but is strongly correlated with textual features and results in no overall improvement; and vice versa, we may find a link-based feature that is weak in isolation but significantly improves overall performance.",
                "For this reason, we have studied the combination of the link-based features above with BM25F.",
                "All feature combinations were done by considering the linear combination of two features as a document score, using the formula score(d) =Pn i=1 wiTi(Fi(d)), where d is a document (or documentquery pair, in the case of BM25F), Fi(d) (for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) is a feature extracted from d, Ti is a transform, and wi is a free scalar weight that needs to be tuned.",
                "We chose transform functions that we empirically determined to be well-suited.",
                "Table 1 shows the chosen transform functions.",
                "This type of linear combination is appropriate if we assume features to be independent with respect to relevance and an exponential model for link features, as discussed in [8].",
                "We tuned the weights by selecting a random subset of 5,000 queries from the query set, used an iterative refinement process to find weights that maximized a given performance measure on that training set, and used the remaining 23,043 queries to measure the performance of the thus derived scoring functions.",
                "We explored the pairwise combination of BM25F with every link-based scoring function.",
                "Figure 3 shows the NDCG, MRR, and <br>map</br> measures of these feature combinations, together with a baseline BM25F score (the right-most bar in each graph), which was computed using the same subset of 23,045 queries that were used as the test set for the feature combinations.",
                "Regardless of the performance measure applied, we can make the following general observations: 1.",
                "Combining any of the link-based features with BM25F results in a substantial performance improvement over BM25F in isolation. 2.",
                "The combination of BM25F with features based on incoming links (PageRank, in-degree, and HITS authority scores) performs substantially better than the combination with features based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree). 3.",

                "However, the combination of BM25F with any in-degree variant, and in particular with id in-degree, consistently outperforms the combination of BM25F with PageRank or HITS authority scores, and can be computed much easier and faster.",
                "Finally, we investigated whether certain features are better for some queries than for others.",
                "Particularly, we are interested in the relationship between the specificity of a query and the performance of different ranking features.",
                "The most straightforward measure of the specificity of a query Q would be the number of documents in a search engines corpus that satisfy Q.",
                "Unfortunately, the query set available to us did not contain this information.",
                "Therefore, we chose to approximate the specificity of Q by summing up the inverse document frequencies of the individual query terms comprising Q.",
                "The inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term t with respect to a corpus C is defined to be logN/doc(t), where doc(t) is the number of documents in C containing t and N is the total number of documents in C. By summing up the IDFs of the query terms, we make the (flawed) assumption that the individual query terms are independent of each other.",
                "However, while not perfect, this approximation is at least directionally correct.",
                "We broke down our query set into 13 buckets, each bucket associated with an interval of query IDF values, and we computed performance metrics for all ranking functions applied (in isolation) to the queries in each bucket.",
                "In order to keep the graphs readable, we will not show the performance of all the features, but rather restrict ourselves to the four most interesting ones: PageRank, id HITS authority scores, id in-degree, and BM25F.",
                "Figure 4 shows the <br>map</br>@10 for all 13 query specificity buckets.",
                "Buckets on the far left of each graph represent very general queries; buckets on the far right represent very specific queries.",
                "The figures on the upper x axis of each graph show the number of queries in each bucket (e.g. the right-most bucket contains 1,629 queries).",
                "BM25F performs best for medium-specific queries, peaking at the buckets representing the IDF sum interval [12,14).",
                "By comparison, HITS peaks at the bucket representing the IDF sum interval [4,6), and PageRank and in-degree peak at the bucket representing the interval [6,8), i.e. more general queries. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper describes a large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of HITS in comparison with other link-based ranking algorithms, in particular PageRank and in-degree, when applied in isolation or in combination with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text (BM25F).",

                "HITS hub scores and web page out-degree are much less effective ranking features, but still outperform a random ordering.",
                "A linear combination of any link-based features with BM25F produces a significant improvement in performance, and there is a clear difference between combining BM25F with a feature based on incoming links (indegree, PageRank, or HITS authority scores) and a feature based on outgoing links (HITS hub scores and out-degree), but within those two groups the precise choice of link-based feature matters relatively little.",
                "We believe that the measurements presented in this paper provide a solid evaluation of the best well-known link-based ranking schemes.",
                "There are many possible variants of these schemes, and many other link-based ranking algorithms have been proposed in the literature, hence we do not claim this work to be the last word on this subject, but rather the first step on a long road.",

                "In particular, we would like to study the impact of changes to the PageRank damping factor on effectiveness, the impact of various schemes meant to counteract the effects of link spam, and the effect of weighing hyperlinks differently depending on whether they are nepotistic or not.",

                "We quantified their effectiveness using three common performance measures: the mean reciprocal rank, the mean average precision, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain measurements.",
                "The evaluation is based on two large data sets: a breadth-first search crawl of 463 million web pages containing 17.6 billion hyperlinks and referencing 2.9 billion distinct URLs; and a set of 28,043 queries sampled from a query log, each query having on average 2,383 results, about 17 of which were labeled by judges.",
                "We found that HITS outperforms PageRank, but is about as effective as web-page in-degree.",
                "The same holds true when any of the link-based features are combined with the text retrieval algorithm.",
                "Finally, we studied the relationship between query specificity and the effectiveness of selected features, and found that link-based features perform better for general queries, whereas BM25F performs better for specific queries.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information Storage and Retrieval-search process, selection process General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Link graph features such as in-degree and PageRank have been shown to significantly improve the performance of text retrieval algorithms on the web.",
                "The HITS algorithm is also believed to be of interest for web search; to some degree, one may expect HITS to be more informative that other link-based features because it is query-dependent: it tries to measure the interest of pages with respect to a given query.",
                "However, it remains unclear today whether there are practical benefits of HITS over other link graph measures.",
                "This is even more true when we consider that modern retrieval algorithms used on the web use a document representation which incorporates the documents anchor text, i.e. the text of incoming links.",
                "This, at least to some degree, takes the link graph into account, in a query-dependent manner.",
                "Comparing HITS to PageRank or in-degree empirically is no easy task.",
                "There are two main difficulties: scale and relevance.",
                "Scale is important because link-based features are known to improve in quality as the document graph grows.",
                "If we carry out a small experiment, our conclusions wont carry over to large graphs such as the web.",
                "However, computing HITS efficiently on a graph the size of a realistic web crawl is extraordinarily difficult.",
                "Relevance is also crucial because we cannot measure the performance of a feature in the absence of human judgments: what is crucial is ranking at the top of the ten or so documents that a user will peruse.",
                "To our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate HITS at a large scale and compare it to other link-based features with respect to human evaluated judgment.",
                "Our results confirm many of the intuitions we have about link-based features and their relationship to text retrieval methods exploiting anchor text.",
                "This is reassuring: in the absence of a theoretical model capable of tying these measures with relevance, the only way to validate our intuitions is to carry out realistic experiments.",
                "However, we were quite surprised to find that HITS, a query-dependent feature, is about as effective as web page in-degree, the most simpleminded query-independent link-based feature.",
                "This continues to be true when the link-based features are combined with a text retrieval algorithm exploiting anchor text.",
                "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
                "Section 3 describes the data sets we used in our study.",
                "Section 4 reviews the performance measures we used.",
                "Sections 5 and 6 describe the PageRank and HITS algorithms in more detail, and sketch the computational infrastructure we employed to carry out large scale experiments.",
                "Section 7 presents the results of our evaluations, and Section 8 offers concluding remarks. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The idea of using hyperlink analysis for ranking web search results arose around 1997, and manifested itself in the HITS [16, 17] and PageRank [5, 21] algorithms.",
                "The popularity of these two algorithms and the phenomenal success of the Google search engine, which uses PageRank, have spawned a large amount of subsequent research.",
                "There are numerous attempts at improving the effectiveness of HITS and PageRank.",
                "Query-dependent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by HITS include SALSA [19], Randomized HITS [20], and PHITS [7], to name a few.",
                "Query-independent link-based ranking algorithms inspired by PageRank include TrafficRank [22], BlockRank [14], and TrustRank [11], and many others.",
                "Another line of research is concerned with analyzing the mathematical properties of HITS and PageRank.",
                "For example, Borodin et al. [3] investigated various theoretical properties of PageRank, HITS, SALSA, and PHITS, including their similarity and stability, while Bianchini et al. [2] studied the relationship between the structure of the web graph and the distribution of PageRank scores, and Langville and Meyer examined basic properties of PageRank such as existence and uniqueness of an eigenvector and convergence of power iteration [18].",
                "Given the attention that has been paid to improving the effectiveness of PageRank and HITS, and the thorough studies of the mathematical properties of these algorithms, it is somewhat surprising that very few evaluations of their effectiveness have been published.",
                "We are aware of two studies that have attempted to formally evaluate the effectiveness of HITS and of PageRank.",
                "Amento et al. [1] employed quantitative measures, but based their experiments on the result sets of just 5 queries and the web-graph induced by topical crawls around the result set of each query.",
                "A more recent study by Borodin et al. [4] is based on 34 queries, result sets of 200 pages per query obtained from Google, and a neighborhood graph derived by retrieving 50 in-links per result from Google.",
                "By contrast, our study is based on over 28,000 queries and a web graph covering 2.9 billion URLs. 3.",
                "OUR DATA SETS Our evaluation is based on two data sets: a large web graph and a substantial set of queries with associated results, some of which were labeled by human judges.",
                "Our web graph is based on a web crawl that was conducted in a breadth-first-search fashion, and successfully retrieved 463,685,607 HTML pages.",
                "These pages contain 17,672,011,890 hyperlinks (after eliminating duplicate hyperlinks embedded in the same web page), which refer to a total of 2,897,671,002 URLs.",
                "Thus, at the end of the crawl there were 2,433,985,395 URLs in the frontier set of the crawler that had been discovered, but not yet downloaded.",
                "The mean out-degree of crawled web pages is 38.11; the mean in-degree of discovered pages (whether crawled or not) is 6.10.",
                "Also, it is worth pointing out that there is a lot more variance in in-degrees than in out-degrees; some popular pages have millions of incoming links.",
                "As we will see, this property affects the computational cost of HITS.",
                "Our query set was produced by sampling 28,043 queries from the MSN Search query log, and retrieving a total of 66,846,214 result URLs for these queries (using commercial search engine technology), or about 2,838 results per query on average.",
                "It is important to point out that our 2.9 billion URL web graph does not cover all these result URLs.",
                "In fact, only 9,525,566 of the result URLs (about 14.25%) were covered by the graph. 485,656 of the results in the query set (about 0.73% of all results, or about 17.3 results per query) were rated by human judges as to their relevance to the given query, and labeled on a six-point scale (the labels being definitive, excellent, good, fair, bad and detrimental).",
                "Results were selected for judgment based on their commercial search engine placement; in other words, the subset of labeled results is not random, but biased towards documents considered relevant by pre-existing ranking algorithms.",
                "Involving a human in the evaluation process is extremely cumbersome and expensive; however, human judgments are crucial for the evaluation of search engines.",
                "This is so because no document features have been found yet that can effectively estimate the relevance of a document to a user query.",
                "Since content-match features are very unreliable (and even more so link features, as we will see) we need to ask a human to evaluate the results in order to compare the quality of features.",
                "Evaluating the retrieval results from document scores and human judgments is not trivial and has been the subject of many investigations in the IR community.",
                "A good performance measure should correlate with user satisfaction, taking into account that users will dislike having to delve deep in the results to find relevant documents.",
                "For this reason, standard correlation measures (such as the correlation coefficient between the score and the judgment of a document), or order correlation measures (such as Kendall tau between the score and judgment induced orders) are not adequate. 4.",
                "MEASURING PERFORMANCE In this study, we quantify the effectiveness of various ranking algorithms using three measures: <br>ndcg</br>, MRR, and MAP.",
                "The normalized discounted cumulative gains (<br>ndcg</br>) measure [13] discounts the contribution of a document to the overall score as the documents rank increases (assuming that the best document has the lowest rank).",
                "Such a measure is particularly appropriate for search engines, as studies have shown that search engine users rarely consider anything beyond the first few results [12].",
                "<br>ndcg</br> values are normalized to be between 0 and 1, with 1 being the <br>ndcg</br> of a perfect ranking scheme that completely agrees with the assessment of the human judges.",
                "The discounted cumulative gain at a particular rank-threshold T (DCG@T) is defined to be PT j=1 1 log(1+j) 2r(j) âˆ’ 1 , where r(j) is the rating (0=detrimental, 1=bad, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, and 5=definitive) at rank j.",
                "The <br>ndcg</br> is computed by dividing the DCG of a ranking by the highest possible DCG that can be obtained for that query.",
                "Finally, the NDGCs of all queries in the query set are averaged to produce a mean <br>ndcg</br>.",
                "The reciprocal rank (RR) of the ranked result set of a query is defined to be the reciprocal value of the rank of the highest-ranking relevant document in the result set.",
                "The RR at rank-threshold T is defined to be 0 if none of the highestranking T documents is relevant.",
                "The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of a query set is the average reciprocal rank of all queries in the query set.",
                "Given a ranked set of n results, let rel(i) be 1 if the result at rank i is relevant and 0 otherwise.",
                "The precision P(j) at rank j is defined to be 1 j Pj i=1 rel(i), i.e. the fraction of the relevant results among the j highest-ranking results.",
                "The average precision (AP) at rank-threshold k is defined to be Pk i=1 P (i)rel(i) Pn i=1 rel(i) .",
                "The mean average precision (MAP) of a query set is the mean of the average precisions of all queries in the query set.",
                "The above definitions of MRR and MAP rely on the notion of a relevant result.",
                "We investigated two definitions of relevance: One where all documents rated fair or better were deemed relevant, and one were all documents rated good or better were deemed relevant.",
                "For reasons of space, we only report MAP and MRR values computed using the latter definition; using the former definition does not change the qualitative nature of our findings.",
                "Similarly, we computed <br>ndcg</br>, MAP, and MRR values for a wide range of rank-thresholds; we report results here at rank 10; again, changing the rank-threshold never led us to different conclusions.",
                "Recall that over 99% of documents are unlabeled.",
                "We chose to treat all these documents as irrelevant to the query.",
                "For some queries, however, not all relevant documents have been judged.",
                "This introduces a bias into our evaluation: features that bring new documents to the top of the rank may be penalized.",
                "This will be more acute for features less correlated to the pre-existing commercial ranking algorithms used to select documents for judgment.",
                "On the other hand, most queries have few perfect relevant documents (i.e. home page or item searches) and they will most often be within the judged set. 5.",
                "COMPUTING PAGERANK ON A LARGE WEB GRAPH PageRank is a query-independent measure of the importance of web pages, based on the notion of peer-endorsement: A hyperlink from page A to page B is interpreted as an endorsement of page Bs content by page As author.",
                "The following recursive definition captures this notion of endorsement: R(v) = X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where R(v) is the score (importance) of page v, (u, v) is an edge (hyperlink) from page u to page v contained in the edge set E of the web graph, and Out(u) is the out-degree (number of embedded hyperlinks) of page u.",
                "However, this definition suffers from a severe shortcoming: In the fixedpoint of this recursive equation, only edges that are part of a strongly-connected component receive a non-zero score.",
                "In order to overcome this deficiency, Page et al. grant each page a guaranteed minimum score, giving rise to the definition of standard PageRank: R(v) = d |V | + (1 âˆ’ d) X (u,v)âˆˆE R(u) Out(u) where |V | is the size of the vertex set (the number of known web pages), and d is a damping factor, typically set to be between 0.1 and 0.2.",
                "Assuming that scores are normalized to sum up to 1, PageRank can be viewed as the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on the web graph, where at each step of the walk, the walker with probability 1 âˆ’ d moves from its current node u to a neighboring node v, and with probability d selects a node uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph and jumps to it.",
                "In the limit, the random walker is at node v with probability R(v).",
                "One issue that has to be addressed when implementing PageRank is how to deal with sink nodes, nodes that do not have any outgoing links.",
                "One possibility would be to select another node uniformly at random and transition to it; this is equivalent to adding edges from each sink nodes to all other nodes in the graph.",
                "We chose the alternative approach of introducing a single phantom node.",
                "Each sink node has an edge to the phantom node, and the phantom node has an edge to itself.",
                "In practice, PageRank scores can be computed using power iteration.",
                "Since PageRank is query-independent, the computation can be performed off-line ahead of query time.",
                "This property has been key to PageRanks success, since it is a challenging engineering problem to build a system that can perform any non-trivial computation on the web graph at query time.",
                "In order to compute PageRank scores for all 2.9 billion nodes in our web graph, we implemented a distributed version of PageRank.",
                "The computation consists of two distinct phases.",
                "In the first phase, the link files produced by the web crawler, which contain page URLs and their associated link URLs in textual form, are partitioned among the machines in the cluster used to compute PageRank scores, and converted into a more compact format along the way.",
                "Specifically, URLs are partitioned across the machines in the cluster based on a hash of the URLs host component, and each machine in the cluster maintains a table mapping the URL to a 32-bit integer.",
                "The integers are drawn from a densely packed space, so as to make suitable indices into the array that will later hold the PageRank scores.",
                "The system then translates our log of pages and their associated hyperlinks into a compact representation where both page URLs and link URLs are represented by their associated 32-bit integers.",
                "Hashing the host component of the URLs guarantees that all URLs from the same host are assigned to the same machine in our scoring cluster.",
