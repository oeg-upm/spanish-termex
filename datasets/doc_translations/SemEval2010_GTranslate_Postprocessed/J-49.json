We leverage a unique data source of almost 2000 peoples subjective probability judgments on 2003 US National Football League games and compare with the market probabilities given by two different information markets on exactly the same events. We combine assessments of multiple experts via linear and logarithmic aggregation functions to form pooled predictions. Prices in information markets are used to derive market predictions. Our results show that, at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as pooled expert assessments. In screening pooled expert predictions, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performance does not improve accuracy of pooled predictions; and logarithmic aggregation functions offer bolder predictions than linear aggregation functions. The results provide insights into the predictive performance of information markets, and the relative merits of selecting among various opinion pooling methods.

INTRODUCTION Forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies. For decades, scientists have been developing and exploring various forecasting methods, which can be roughly divided into statistical and non-statistical approaches. Statistical approaches require not only the existence of enough historical data but also that past data contains valuable information about the future event. When these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on judgmental information about the future event could be better choices. One widely used non-statistical method is to elicit opinions from experts. Since experts are not generally in agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a single prediction. These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12]. With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical forecasting tool. Information markets (sometimes called prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are markets designed for aggregating information and making predictions about future events. To form the predictions, information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of events. For example, in an information market to predict the result of a US professional National Football League (NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if New England wins the game. Otherwise, it pays off nothing. The security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the probability of New England winning the game. Such markets are becoming very popular. The Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) [2] are real-money futures markets to predict economic and political events such as elections. The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) [3] is a virtual (play-money) exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment awards, etc. TradeSports.com [7], a real-money betting exchange registered in Ireland, hosts markets for sports, political, entertainment, and financial events. The Foresight Exchange (FX) [4] allows traders to wager play money on unresolved scientific questions or other claims of public interest, and NewsFutures.coms World News Exchange [1] has 58 popular sports and financial betting markets, also grounded in a play-money currency. Despite the popularity of information markets, one of the most important questions to ask is: how accurately can information markets predict? Previous research in general shows that information markets are remarkably accurate. The political election markets at IEM predict the election outcomes better than polls [16, 17, 18, 19]. Prices in HSX and FX have been found to give as accurate or more accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33, 34, 37]. However, information markets have not been calibrated against opinion pools, except for Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which the authors compare two information markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions. Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective. The comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to choose the most appropriate method for their needs. This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools. In terms of prediction accuracy, we compare two information markets with several linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) at predicting the results of NFL games. Our results show that at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools. In selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy of opinion pools; and LogOP offers bolder predictions than LinOP. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews popular opinion pooling methods. Section 3 introduces the basics of information markets. Data sets and our analysis methods are described in Section 4. We present results and analysis in Section 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6. 2. REVIEW OF OPINION POOLS Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches and behavioral approaches. In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event. They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution. Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches. Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches. Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution. These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties. Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP). Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts. Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution. Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13]. Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods. Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event. This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule. The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion. Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior. The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions. One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28]. Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback. Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved. Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments. Each approach has its pros and cons. Axiomatic approaches are easy to use. But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights. In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator. Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework. However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts. Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3. HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15]. Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants. The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information. The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security. Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35]. Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event. This idea gives rise to information markets. For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise. The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market. The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short. Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market. Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game. Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game. The above security is a winner-takes-all contract. It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary). Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized. When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value. This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract. It predicts the expected value of a future outcome. Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities. Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict. In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market. Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4. DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003. NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal. Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1]. For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome. We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game. They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game. Small differences exist in how they deal with ties. In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures. Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation. TradeSports is a real-money exchange. A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market. Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity. On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration. Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss. They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities. The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism. TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not. We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money. Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level. Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental. We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6]. The contest is free to enter. Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game. Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team. The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully. For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins. If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins. This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong. The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest. The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win. This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score. However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward. We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win. To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game. For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games. Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions. The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12]. Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1. In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled. For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights. The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest. The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest. For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights. For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player. Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative. Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise. For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted. We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper. As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts. Only the best performing experts are selected. For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants. Since there is no performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all participants in the first week. For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20. For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected. Experts are chosen in a similar way for later weeks. Thus, the top 20 participants can change from week to week. The possible opinion pools, varied in pooling functions, weighting methods, and number of expert opinions, are shown 61 Table 1: Pooled Expert Predictions # Symbol Description 1 Lin-All-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LinOP of all experts. 2 Lin-All-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LinOP of all experts. 3 Lin-n-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LinOP with n experts. 4 Lin-n-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LinOP with n experts. 5 Log-All-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LogOP of all experts. 6 Log-All-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LogOP of all experts. 7 Log-n-u Unweighted (equally weighted) LogOP with n experts. 8 Log-n-w Weighted (performance-weighted) LogOP with n experts. in Table 1. Lin represents linear, and Log represents Logarithmic. n is the number of expert opinions that are pooled, and All indicates that all opinions are combined. We use u to symbolize unweighted (equally weighted) opinion pools. w is used for weighted (performance-weighted) opinion pools. Lin-All-u, the equally weighted LinOP with all participants, is basically the arithmetic mean of all participants opinions. Log-All-u is simply the geometric mean of all opinions. When a participant did not enter a prediction for a particular game, that participant was removed from the opinion pool for that game. This contrasts with the ProbabilityFootball average reported on the contest website and used by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], where unreported predictions were converted to 0.5 probability predictions. 4.2.2 Performance Measures We use three common metrics to assess prediction accuracy of information markets and opinion pools. These measures have been used by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36] in evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets. 1. Absolute Error = Prob Lose, where Prob Lose is the probability assigned to the eventual losing team. Absolute error simply measures the difference between a perfect prediction (1 for winning team) and the actual prediction. A prediction with lower absolute error is more accurate. 2. Quadratic Score = 100 − 400 × (Prob Lose2 ). Quadratic score is the scoring function that is used in the ProbabilityFootball contest. It is a linear transformation of squared error, Prob Lose2 , which is one of the mostly used metrics in evaluating forecasting accuracy. Quadratic score can be negative. A prediction with higher quadratic score is more accurate. 3. Logarithmic Score = log(Prob W in), where Prob W in is the probability assigned to the eventual winning team. The logarithmic score, like the quadratic score, is a proper scoring rule. A prediction with higher (less negative) logarithmic score is more accurate. 5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS 5.1 Performance of Opinion Pools Depending on how many opinions are used, there can be numerous different opinion pools. We first examine the effect of number of opinions on prediction accuracy by forming opinion pools with the number of expert opinions varying from 1 to 960. In the ProbabilityFootball Competition, not all 1966 registered participants provide their probability assessments for every game. 960 is the smallest number of participants for all games. For each game, we sort experts according to their accumulated quadratic score in previous weeks. Predictions of the best performing n participants are picked to form an opinion pool with n experts. Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance measures across all 210 games. We can see the following trends in the figure. 1. Unweighted opinion pools and performance-weighted opinion pools have similar levels of prediction accuracy, especially for LinOP. 2. For LinOP, increasing the number of experts in general increases or keeps the same the level of prediction accuracy. When there are more than 200 experts, the prediction accuracy of LinOP is stable regarding the number of experts. 3. LogOP seems more accurate than LinOP in terms of mean absolute error. But, using all other performance measures, LinOP outperforms LogOP. 4. For LogOP, increasing the number of experts increases the prediction accuracy at the beginning. But the curves (including the points with all experts) for mean quadratic score, and mean logarithmic score have slight bell-shapes, which represent a decrease in prediction accuracy when the number of experts is very large. The curves for mean absolute error, on the other hand, show a consistent increase of accuracy. The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts. Weighting does not seem to improve performance. Selecting experts according to past performance also does not help. It is a very interesting observation that even if many participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest do not provide accurate individual predictions (they have negative quadratic scores in the contest), including their opinions into the opinion pool still increases the prediction accuracy. One explanation of this phenomena could be that biases of individual judgment can offset with each other when opinions are diverse, which makes the pooled prediction more accurate. The third trend presents a controversy. The relative prediction accuracy of LogOP and LinOP flips when using different accuracy measures. To investigate this disagreement, we plot the absolute error of Log-All-u and Lin-All-u for each game in Figure 2. When the absolute error of an opinion 62 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 All 0.4 0.405 0.41 0.415 0.42 0.425 0.43 0.435 0.44 0.445 0.45 Number of Expert Opinions MeanAbsoluteError Unweighted Linear Weighted Linear Unweighted Logarithmic Weighted Logarithmic Lin−All−u Lin−All−w Log−All−u Log−All−w (a) Mean Absolute Error 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 All 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Number of Expert Opinions MeanQuadraticScore Unweighted Linear Weighted Linear Unweighted Logarithmic Weighted Logarithmic Lin−All−u Lin−All−w Log−All−u Log−All−w 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 All −0.71 −0.7 −0.69 −0.68 −0.67 −0.66 −0.65 −0.64 −0.63 −0.62 Number of Expert Opinions MeanLogarithmicScore Unweighted Linear Weighted Linear Unweighted Logarithmic Weighted Logarithmic Lin−All−u Lin−All−w Log−All−u Log−All−w (b) Mean Quadratic Score (c) Mean Logarithmic Score Figure 1: Prediction Accuracy of Opinion Pools pool for a game is less than 0.5, it means that the team favored by the opinion pool wins the game. If it is greater than 0.5, the underdog wins. Compared with Lin-All-u, Log-All-u has lower absolute error when it is less than 0.5, and greater absoluter error when it is greater than 0.5, which indicates that predictions of Log-All-u are bolder, more close to 0 or 1, than those of Lin-All-u. This is due to the nature of linear and logarithmic aggregating functions. Because quadratic score and logarithmic score penalize bold predictions that are wrong, LogOP is less accurate when measured in these terms. Similar reasoning accounts for the fourth trend. When there are more than 500 experts, increasing number of experts used in LogOP improves the prediction accuracy measured by absolute error, but worsens the accuracy measured by the other two metrics. Examining expert opinions, we find that participants who rank lower are more frequent in offering extreme predictions (0 or 1) than those ranking high in the list. When we increase the number of experts in an opinion pool, we are incorporating more extreme predictions into it. The resulting LogOP is bolder, and hence has lower mean quadratic score and mean logarithmic score. 5.2 Comparison of Information Markets and Opinion Pools Through the first screening of various opinion pools, we select Lin-All-u, Log-All-u, Log-All-w, and Log-200-u to compare with predictions from information markets. Lin-All-u as shown in Figure 1 can represent what LinOP can achieve. However, the performance of LogOP is not consistent when evaluated using different metrics. Log-All-u and Log-All-w offer either the best or the worst predictions. Log-200-u, the LogOP with the 200 top performing experts, provides more stable predictions. We use all of the three to stand for the performance of LogOP in our later comparison. If a prediction of the probability that a team will win a game, either from an opinion pool or an information market, is higher than 0.5, we say that the team is the predicted favorite for the game. Table 2 presents the number and percentage of games that predicted favorites actually win, out of a total of 210 games. All four opinion pools correctly predict a similar number and percentage of games as NF and TS. Since NF, TS, and the four opinion pools form their predictions using information available at noon of the game 63 Table 2: Number and Percentage of Games that Predicted Favorites Win NF TS Lin-All-u Log-All-u Log-All-w Log-200-u Number 142 137 144 144 143 141 Percentage 67.62% 65.24% 68.57% 68.57% 68.10% 67.14% Table 3: Mean of Prediction Accuracy Measures Absolute Error Quadratic Score Logarithmic Score NF 0.4253 15.4352 -0.6136 (0.0121) (4.6072) (0.0258) TS 0.4275 15.2739 -0.6121 (0.0118) (4.3982) (0.0241) Lin-All-u 0.4292 13.0525 -0.6260 (0.0126) (4.8088) (0.0268) Log-All-u 0.4024 10.0099 -0.6546 (0.0173) (6.6594) (0.0418) Log-All-w 0.4059 10.4491 -0.6497 (0.0168) (6.4440) (0.0398) Log-200-u 0.4266 12.3868 -0.6319 (0.0133) (5.0764) (0.0295) *Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. *Best value for each metric is shown in bold. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Absolute Error of Lin−All−u AbsoluteErrorofLog−All−u 45 Degree Line Absolute Error Figure 2: Absolute Error: Lin-All-u vs. Log-All-u day, information markets and opinion pools have comparable potential at the same time point. We then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of information markets and opinion pools using the three performance measures. Table 3 displays mean values of these measures over 210 games. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors, which estimate the standard deviation of the mean. To take into consideration of skewness of distributions, we also report median values of accuracy measures in Table 4. Judged by the mean values of accuracy measures in Table 3, all methods have similar accuracy levels, with NF and TS slightly better than the opinion pools. However, the median values of accuracy measures indicate that LogAll-u and Log-All-w opinion pools are more accurate than all other predictions. We employ the randomization test [32] to study whether the differences in prediction accuracy presented in Table 3 and Table 4 are statistically significant. The basic idea of randomization test is that, by randomly swapping predictions of two methods numerous times, an empirical distribution for the difference of prediction accuracy can be constructed. Using this empirical distribution, we are then able to evaluate that at what confidence level the observed difference reflects a real difference. For example, the mean absolute error of NF is higher than that of Log-All-u by 0.0229, as shown in Table 3. To test whether this difference is statistically significant, we shuﬄe predictions from two methods, randomly label half of predictions as NF and the other half as Log-All-u, and compute the difference of mean absolute error of the newly formed NF and Log-All-u data. The above procedure is repeated 10,000 times. The 10,000 differences of mean absolute error results in an empirical distribution of the difference. Comparing our observed difference, 0.0229, with this distribution, we find that the observed difference is greater than 75.37% of the empirical differences. This leads us to conclude that the difference of mean absolute error between NF and Log-All-u is not statistically significant, if we choose the level of significance to be 0.05. Table 5 and Table 6 are results of randomization test for mean and median differences respectively. Each cell of the table is for two different prediction methods, represented by name of the row and name of the column. The first lines of table cells are results for absolute error. The second and third lines are dedicated to quadratic score and logarithmic score respectively. We can see that, in terms of mean values of accuracy measures, the differences of all methods are not statistically significant to any reasonable degree.

These results indicate that differences in prediction accuracy between information markets and opinion pools are not statistically significant. This may seem to contradict the result of Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which NewsFuturess information markets have been shown to provide statistically significantly more accurate predictions than the (unweighted) average of all ProbabilityFootball opinions. The discrepancy emerges in dealing with missing data. Not all 1966 registered ProbabilityFootball participants offer probability assessments for each game. When a participant does not provide a probability assessment for a game, the contest considers their prediction as 0.5.. This makes sense in the context of the contest, since 0.5 always yields 0 quadratic score. The ProbabilityFootball average reported on the contest website and used by Servan-Schreiber et. al includes these 0.5 estimates. Instead, we remove participants from games that they do not provide assessments, pooling only the available opinions together. Our treatment increases the prediction accuracy of Lin-All-u significantly. 6. CONCLUSIONS With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as an alternative tool for predicting future events. Previous research has shown that information markets give as accurate or more accurate predictions than individual experts and polls. However, information markets, as an adaptive mechanism to aggregate different opinions of market participants, have not been calibrated against many belief aggregation methods. In this paper, we compare prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) using predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals regarding the outcomes of 210 American football games during the 2003 NFL season. In screening for representative opinion pools to compare with information markets, we investigate the effect of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy. Our results on both the comparison of information markets and opinion pools and the relative performance of different opinion pools are summarized as below. 1. At the same time point ahead of the events, information markets offer as accurate predictions as our selected opinion pools. We have selected four opinion pools to represent the prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can achieve. With all four performance metrics, our two information markets obtain similar prediction accuracy as the four opinion pools. 65 Table 6: Statistical Confidence of Median Differences in Prediction Accuracy TS Lin-All-u Log-All-u Log-All-w Log-200-u NF 48.85% 47.3% 84.8% 77.9% 65.36% 45.26% 44.55% 85.27% 75.65% 66.75% 44.89% 46.04% 84.43% 77.16% 64.78% TS 5.18% 94.83% 94.31% 0% 5.37% 92.08% 92.53% 0% 7.41% 95.62% 91.09% 0% Lin-All-u 95.11% 91.37% 7.31% 96.10% 92.69% 9.84% 95.45% 95.12% 7.79% Log-All-u 23.47% 95.89% 26.68% 93.85% 22.47% 96.42% Log-All-w 91.3% 91.4% 90.37% *In each table cell, row 1 accounts for absolute error, row 2 for quadratic score, and row 3 for logarithmic score. *Confidence above 95% is shown in bold. 2. The arithmetic average of all opinions (Lin-All-u) is a simple, robust, and efficient opinion pool. Simply averaging across all experts seems resulting in better predictions than individual opinions and opinion pools with a few experts. It is quite robust in the sense that even if the included individual predictions are less accurate, averaging over all opinions still gives better (or equally good) predictions. 3. Weighting expert opinions according to past performance does not seem to significantly improve prediction accuracy of either LinOP or LogOP. Comparing performance-weighted opinion pools with equally weighted opinion pools, we do not observe much difference in terms of prediction accuracy. Since we only use one performance-weighting method, calculating the weights according to past accumulated quadratic score that participants earned, this might due to the weighting method we chose. 4. LogOP yields bolder predictions than LinOP. LogOP yields predictions that are closer to the extremes, 0 or 1. An information markets is a self-organizing mechanism for aggregating information and making predictions. Compared with opinion pools, it is less constrained by space and time, and can eliminate the efforts to identify experts and decide belief aggregation methods. But the advantages do not compromise their prediction accuracy to any extent. On the contrary, information markets can provide real-time predictions, which are hardly achievable through resorting to experts. In the future, we are interested in further exploring: • Performance comparison of information markets with other opinion pools and mathematical aggregation procedures. In this paper, we only compare information markets with two simple opinion pools, linear and logarithmic. It will be meaningful to investigate their relative prediction accuracy with other belief aggregation methods such as Bayesian approaches. There are also a number of theoretical expert algorithms with proven worst-case performance bounds [10] whose average-case or practical performance would be instructive to investigate. • Whether defining expertise more narrowly can improve predictions of opinion pools. In our analysis, we broadly treat participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest as experts in all games. If we define expertise more narrowly, selecting experts in certain football teams to predict games involving these teams, will the predictions of opinion pools be more accurate? • The possibility of combining information markets with other forecasting methods to achieve better prediction accuracy. Chen, Fine, and Huberman [11] use an information market to determine the risk attitude of participants, and then perform a nonlinear aggregation of their predictions based on their risk attitudes. The nonlinear aggregation mechanism is shown to outperform both the market and the best individual participants. It is worthy of more attention whether information markets, as an alternative forecasting method, can be used together with other methods to improve our predictions. 7.

Aprovechamos una fuente de datos única de casi 2000 juicios de probabilidad subjetivos de las personas en los juegos de la Liga Nacional de Fútbol de EE. UU. 2003 y comparamos con las probabilidades de mercado dadas por dos mercados de información diferentes en exactamente los mismos eventos. Combinamos evaluaciones de múltiples expertos a través de funciones de agregación lineal y logarítmica para formar predicciones agrupadas. Los precios en los mercados de la información se utilizan para obtener predicciones del mercado. Nuestros resultados muestran que, en el mismo punto de tiempo antes del juego, los mercados de información proporcionan predicciones tan precisas como las evaluaciones de expertos agrupadas. En la detección de predicciones de expertos agrupados, encontramos que el promedio aritmético es una función de agrupación robusta y eficiente;La ponderación de las evaluaciones de expertos según su desempeño anterior no mejora la precisión de las predicciones agrupadas;y las funciones de agregación logarítmica ofrecen predicciones más audaces que las funciones de agregación lineal. Los resultados proporcionan información sobre el rendimiento predictivo de los mercados de la información y los méritos relativos de seleccionar entre varios métodos de agrupación de opinión. Categorías y descriptores de asignaturas J.4 [Aplicaciones informáticas]: Ciencias sociales y conductuales-economía Términos generales Economía, rendimiento 1. El pronóstico de introducción es un esfuerzo ubicuo en las sociedades humanas. Durante décadas, los científicos han estado desarrollando y explorando varios métodos de pronóstico, que pueden dividirse aproximadamente en enfoques estadísticos y no estadísticos. Los enfoques estadísticos requieren no solo la existencia de suficientes datos históricos, sino también para que los datos pasados contengan información valiosa sobre el evento futuro. Cuando no se pueden cumplir estas condiciones, los enfoques no estadísticos que dependen de la información crítica sobre el evento futuro podrían ser mejores opciones. Un método no estadístico ampliamente utilizado es obtener opiniones de los expertos. Dado que los expertos generalmente no están de acuerdo, se han propuesto muchos métodos de agregación de creencias para combinar opiniones de expertos y formar una sola predicción. Estos métodos de agregación de creencias se llaman grupos de opinión, que se han estudiado ampliamente en estadísticas [20, 24, 38], y las ciencias de la gestión [8, 9, 30, 31], y se han aplicado en muchos dominios, como la toma de decisiones grupales [29]y análisis de riesgos [12]. Con el rápido crecimiento de Internet, los mercados de la información se han convertido recientemente en una prometedora herramienta de pronóstico no estadístico. Los mercados de información (a veces llamados mercados de predicción, mercados de ideas o mercados de eventos) son mercados diseñados para agregar información y hacer predicciones sobre eventos futuros. Para formar las predicciones, los mercados de la información vinculan los pagos de valores a los resultados de los eventos. Por ejemplo, en un mercado de la información para predecir el resultado de un juego de la Liga de Fútbol Nacional de Fútbol Profesional de los Estados Unidos (NFL), digamos New England vs Carolina, la seguridad paga una cierta cantidad de dinero por acción a sus tenedores si y solo si Nueva Inglaterra gana eljuego. De lo contrario, no vale la pena. El precio de seguridad antes del juego refleja la expectativa de consenso de los comerciantes del mercado sobre la probabilidad de que Nueva Inglaterra gane el juego. Tales mercados se están volviendo muy populares. Los mercados electrónicos de Iowa (IEM) [2] son mercados de futuros de dinero real para predecir eventos económicos y políticos como las elecciones. La Bolsa de Hollywood (HSX) [3] es un intercambio virtual (dinero de juego) para el comercio de valores para pronosticar futuros ingresos de taquilla de nuevas películas y los resultados de los premios de entretenimiento, etc. Tradesports.com [7], un intercambio de apuestas de dinero real registrado en Irlanda, organiza mercados para deportes, políticos, entretenimiento y eventos financieros. El intercambio de previsión (FX) [4] permite a los comerciantes apostar a jugar dinero en preguntas científicas no resueltas u otras afirmaciones de interés público, y Newsfutures.coms World News Exchange [1] tiene 58 mercados populares de apuestas deportivas y financieras, también basadas en una obra de teatro.-Moneda de dinero. A pesar de la popularidad de los mercados de información, una de las preguntas más importantes para hacer es: ¿con qué precisión pueden predecir los mercados de información? Investigaciones anteriores en general muestran que los mercados de la información son notablemente precisos. Los mercados de elecciones políticas en IEM predicen los resultados electorales mejor que las encuestas [16, 17, 18, 19]. Se ha encontrado que los precios en HSX y FX dan predicciones precisas o más precisas que el juicio de expertos individuales [33, 34, 37]. Sin embargo, los mercados de la información no han sido calibrados contra grupos de opinión, excepto Servan-Schreiber et.Al [36], en el que los autores comparan dos mercados de la información con el promedio aritmético de las opiniones de expertos. Dado que los mercados de la información, en la naturaleza, ofrecen un mecanismo adaptativo y autoorganizado para agregar opiniones de los participantes del mercado, es interesante compararlos con los métodos de agrupación de opinión existentes para evaluar el desempeño de los mercados de la información desde otra perspectiva. La comparación proporcionará una orientación beneficiosa para que los profesionales elijan el método más apropiado para sus necesidades. Este documento contribuye a la literatura de dos maneras: (1) Como un intento inicial de comparar los mercados de información con grupos de opinión de múltiples expertos, lleva a una mejor comprensión de los mercados de la información y su promesa como una institución alternativa para obtener pronósticos precisos;(2) En los grupos de opinión de detección que se utilizarán en la comparación, lanzamos ideas sobre actuaciones relativas de diferentes grupos de opinión. En términos de precisión de predicción, comparamos dos mercados de información con varios grupos de opinión lineal y logarítmica (Linop y Logop) para predecir los resultados de los juegos de la NFL. Nuestros resultados muestran que en el mismo punto de tiempo antes del juego, los mercados de información proporcionan predicciones tan precisas como nuestros grupos de opinión cuidadosamente seleccionados. Al seleccionar los grupos de opinión que se utilizarán en nuestra comparación, encontramos que el promedio aritmético es una función de agrupación robusta y eficiente;La ponderación de las evaluaciones de expertos según sus actuaciones pasadas no mejora la precisión de la predicción de los grupos de opinión;y Logop ofrece predicciones más audaces que Linop. El resto del documento se organiza de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 revisa los métodos de agrupación de opinión popular. La Sección 3 presenta los conceptos básicos de los mercados de la información. Los conjuntos de datos y nuestros métodos de análisis se describen en la Sección 4. Presentamos resultados y análisis en la Sección 5, seguido de conclusiones en la Sección 6. 2. Revisión de los grupos de opinión Clemen y Winkler [12] Clasifican los métodos de agrupación de opinión en dos amplias categorías: enfoques matemáticos y enfoques de comportamiento. En los enfoques matemáticos, las opiniones de los expertos individuales se expresan como distribuciones de probabilidad subjetiva sobre los resultados de un evento incierto. Se combinan a través de varios métodos matemáticos para formar una distribución de probabilidad agregada. Genest y Zidek [24] y francés [20] proporcionan revisiones exhaustivas de los enfoques matemáticos. Los enfoques matemáticos pueden distinguirse aún más en enfoques axiomáticos y enfoques bayesianos. Los enfoques axiomáticos aplican funciones preespecificadas que mapean las opiniones de los expertos, expresadas como un conjunto de distribuciones de probabilidad individuales, a una única distribución de probabilidad agregada. Estas funciones de agrupación se justifican usando axiomas o ciertas propiedades deseables. Dos de las funciones de agrupación más comunes son el grupo de opinión lineal (Linop) y el grupo de opinión logarítmica (LOGOP). Usando Linop, la distribución de probabilidad agregada es una media aritmética ponderada de distribuciones de probabilidad individuales: p (θ) = n i = 1 wipi (θ), (1) donde pi (θ) es experta es una distribución de probabilidad de eventos inciertos θ, p (p (p (θ) representa la distribución de probabilidad agregada, WIS son pesos para expertos, que generalmente no son negativos y suma a 1, y N es el número de expertos. Usando Logop, la distribución de probabilidad agregada es una media geométrica ponderada de distribuciones de probabilidad individuales: p (θ) = k n i = 1 pi (θ) wi, (2) donde k es una constante de normalización para garantizar que la opinión agrupada sea una distribución de probabilidad. Otros métodos de agrupación axiomática a menudo son las extensiones de Linop [22], Logop [23] o ambos [13]. Winkler [39] y Morris [29, 30] establecen el marco temprano de los métodos de agregación bayesiana. Los enfoques bayesianos suponen que hay un tomador de decisiones que tiene una distribución de probabilidad previa sobre el evento θ y una función de probabilidad sobre las opiniones de expertos dado el evento. Este tomador de decisiones toma opiniones de expertos como evidencia y actualiza a sus antecedentes sobre el evento y las opiniones de acuerdo con la regla de Bayes. La distribución de probabilidad posterior resultada de θ es la opinión agrupada. Los enfoques de comportamiento se han estudiado ampliamente en el campo de la toma de decisiones grupales y el comportamiento organizacional. La suposición importante de los enfoques de comportamiento es que, a través del intercambio de opiniones o información, los expertos eventualmente pueden alcanzar un equilibrio donde una mayor interacción no cambiará sus opiniones. Uno de los enfoques de comportamiento más conocidos es la técnica Delphi [28]. Por lo general, este método y sus variantes no permiten una discusión abierta, pero cada experto tiene la oportunidad de juzgar las opiniones de otros expertos, y recibe comentarios. Los expertos pueden reevaluar sus opiniones y repetir el proceso hasta que se logre un consenso o una mayor difusión de opiniones. Algunos otros métodos de comportamiento, como la técnica del grupo nominal [14], promueven discusiones abiertas en entornos controlados. Cada enfoque tiene sus pros y contras. Los enfoques axiomáticos son fáciles de usar. Pero no tienen una base normativa para elegir pesas. Además, varios resultados de imposibilidad (por ejemplo, Genest [21]) muestran que ninguna función de agregación puede satisfacer todas las propiedades deseadas de un grupo de opinión, a menos que la opinión agrupada degenere a una única opinión individual, lo que efectivamente implica un dictador. Los enfoques bayesianos se basan bien en el marco bayesiano normativo. Sin embargo, a veces es frustrantemente difícil de aplicar porque requiere (1) construir una conjunta obscenamente compleja anterior sobre el evento y las opiniones (a menudo poco prácticas incluso en términos de almacenamiento / complejidad del espacio, sin mencionar desde un punto de vista de obtención) o (2 (2) hacer supuestos fuertes sobre lo anterior, como la independencia condicional de los expertos. Los enfoques de comportamiento permiten a los expertos mejorar dinámicamente su información y revisar sus opiniones durante las interacciones, pero muchos de ellos no están fijos ni especificados por completo, y no pueden garantizar la convergencia o la repetibilidad.59 3. Cómo funcionan los mercados de la información gran parte del entusiasmo por los mercados de la información proviene de la hipótesis de Hayek [26] y la hipótesis de mercado eficiente [15]. Hayek, en su crítica clásica de la planificación central en la década de 1940, afirma que el sistema de precios en un mercado competitivo es un mecanismo muy eficiente para agregar información dispersa entre los participantes del mercado. La hipótesis del mercado eficiente establece además que, en un mercado eficiente, el precio de una seguridad incorpora casi instantáneamente toda la información disponible. El precio de mercado resume toda la información relevante entre los comerciantes, por lo tanto, la expectativa de consenso de los participantes del mercado sobre el valor futuro de la seguridad. La evidencia empírica respalda ambas hipótesis en gran medida [25, 27, 35]. Por lo tanto, al asociar el valor de una seguridad con el resultado de un evento futuro incierto, el precio de mercado, al revelar la expectativa de consenso del valor de seguridad, puede predecir indirectamente el resultado del evento. Esta idea da lugar a los mercados de la información. Por ejemplo, si queremos predecir qué equipo ganará el juego de la NFL entre Nueva Inglaterra y Carolina, un mercado de la información puede cambiar una seguridad $ 100 si New England derrota a Carolina, cuyo pago por acción al final del juego se especifica de la siguiente manera:$ 100 si Nueva Inglaterra gana el juego;$ 0 de lo contrario. El precio de seguridad debe igualar aproximadamente el pago esperado de la seguridad en un mercado eficiente. El valor temporal del dinero generalmente se puede ignorar porque las duraciones de la mayoría de los mercados de la información son cortos. Asumir que la exposición al riesgo es aproximadamente igual para ambos resultados, o que hay suficientes especuladores de riesgo efectivo en el mercado, el precio no debe estar sesgado por las actitudes de riesgo de varios actores en el mercado. Por lo tanto, P = PR (Patriots Win) × 100 + [1 - PR (Patriots Win)] × 0, donde P es el precio de la seguridad $ 100 si New England derrota a Carolina y PR (Patriots Win) es la probabilidad de que Nueva InglaterraGanará el juego. Observando el precio de seguridad P antes del juego, podemos obtener relaciones públicas (Patriots Win), que es la predicción colectiva de los participantes del mercado sobre la probabilidad de que Nueva Inglaterra gane el juego. La seguridad anterior es un contrato de ganadores. Se usa cuando el evento a predecir es una variable aleatoria discreta con resultados disjuntos (en este caso binario). Su precio predice la probabilidad de que se realice un resultado específico. Cuando el resultado de un problema de predicción puede ser cualquier valor en un intervalo continuo, podemos diseñar una seguridad que paga a su titular proporcional al valor realizado. Este tipo de seguridad es lo que Wolfers y Zitzewitz [40] llamaron un contrato de índice. Predice el valor esperado de un resultado futuro. Muchos otros aspectos de un evento futuro, como el valor medio del resultado, también se pueden predecir en los mercados de información mediante el diseño y el comercio de diferentes valores. Wolfers y Zitzewitz [40] proporcionan un resumen de los principales tipos de valores negociados en los mercados de información y qué propiedades estadísticas pueden predecir. En la práctica, concebir una seguridad para un problema de predicción es solo una de las muchas decisiones en el diseño de un mercado de información efectivo. Spann y Skiera [37] proponen un marco inicial para diseñar mercados de información.4. Diseño del análisis 4.1 Conjuntos de datos Nuestros conjuntos de datos cubren 210 juegos de la NFL que se celebran entre el 28 de septiembre de 2003 y el 28 de diciembre de 2003. Los juegos de la NFL son muy adecuados para nuestros propósitos porque: (1) dos intercambios en línea y un concurso de predicción en línea ya existen que proporcionan datos sobre los mercados de la información y las opiniones de expertos autoidentificados para el mismo conjunto de juegos;(2) La popularidad de los juegos de la NFL en los Estados Unidos proporciona incentivos naturales para que las personas participen en los mercados de información y/o el concurso, lo que aumenta la liquidez de los mercados de la información y mejora la calidad y el número de opiniones en el concurso;(3) La intensa cobertura de los medios y el análisis de los perfiles y fortalezas de los equipos y los jugadores individuales proporcionan al público mucha información para que los participantes de los mercados de la información y el concurso puedan ser considerados como conocedores con respecto al objetivo de pronóstico. Los datos del mercado de la información se adquirieron, mediante el uso de un programa de rastreadores especialmente diseñado, de los mercados de fútbol-NFL de Tradesports.com [7] y NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1]. Para cada juego de la NFL, tanto los deportes comerciales como las noticias tienen un mercado de la información ganador para predecir el resultado del juego. Presentamos el diseño de los dos mercados según Spann y Skieras tres pasos para diseñar un mercado de la información [37] como se muestra a continuación.• Elección de la meta de pronóstico: los mercados en Tradesports y Newsfutures tienen como objetivo predecir cuál de los dos equipos ganará un juego de fútbol de la NFL. Cambian de valores de ganadores similares, todos los valores que pagan 100 si un equipo gana el juego y 0 si pierde el juego. Existen pequeñas diferencias en cómo tratan los lazos. En el caso de un empate, Tradesports desenrollará todas las operaciones que ocurrieron y reembolsarán todas las tarifas de intercambio, pero la seguridad vale 50 en los problemas de noticias. Dado que la probabilidad de un empate suele ser muy baja (mucho menos el 1%), los precios en ambos mercados representan efectivamente la evaluación de consenso de los participantes del mercado de la probabilidad de que el equipo gane.• Incentivo para la participación y la revelación de la información: los deportes comerciales y las noticias utilizan diferentes incentivos para la participación y la revelación de la información. Tradesports es un intercambio de dinero real. Un operador necesita abrir y financiar una cuenta con un mínimo de $ 100 para participar en el mercado. Tanto las ganancias como las pérdidas pueden ocurrir como resultado de la actividad comercial. Por el contrario, un comerciante puede registrarse en Newsfutures de forma gratuita y obtener 2000 unidades de dinero virtual de intercambio deportivo al momento del registro. Los comerciantes de NewsFutures no incurrirán en ninguna pérdida financiera real. Pueden acumular dinero virtual al negociar valores. El dinero virtual se puede usar para ofertar por algunos premios reales en la tienda en línea de Newsfutures.• Diseño del mercado financiero: ambos mercados en Tradesports y News -Future utilizan la doble subasta continua como su mecanismo comercial. Tradesports cobra una pequeña tarifa por cada transacción de seguridad y vencimiento, mientras que las noticias de noticias no. Podemos ver que la principal diferencia entre dos mercados de información es el dinero real frente al dinero virtual. Servan-Schreiber 60 et.Al [36] han comparado el efecto del dinero en el rendimiento de los dos mercados de la información y concluyó que la precisión de predicción de los dos mercados está en el mismo nivel. Sin tener la intención de comparar estos dos mercados, todavía utilizamos ambos mercados en nuestro análisis para garantizar que nuestros hallazgos no sean accidentales. Obtuvimos las opiniones de los expertos autoidentificados de 1966 para los juegos de la NFL del concurso de probabilidad de Football en línea [5], uno de varios concursos de Probabilidad de Ports [6]. El concurso es gratuito para ingresar. Se les pide a los participantes del concurso que ingresen su probabilidad subjetiva de que un equipo gane un juego al mediodía del día del juego. Es importante destacar que el concurso evalúa el rendimiento de los participantes a través de la regla de puntuación cuadrática: S = 100 - 400 × prob LEDS2, (3) donde S representa el puntaje que un participante gana para el juego, y Prob Lo pierde es la probabilidad de que el participante asigneEl equipo perdedor real. La puntuación cuadrática es una de una familia de las llamadas reglas de puntuación adecuadas que tienen la propiedad de que un puntaje de expertos esperado se maximiza cuando el experto informa las probabilidades con sinceridad. Por ejemplo, para un juego del equipo A vs. Equipo B, si un jugador asigna 0.5 tanto al equipo A como a B, su puntaje para el juego es 0 sin importar qué equipo gane. Si él/ella asigna 0.8 al equipo A y 0.2 al Equipo B, lo que demuestra que confía en el equipo como ganador, anotará 84 puntos para el juego si el equipo A gana, y perderá 156 puntos si el equipo B gana. Esta regla de puntuación cuadrática recompensa las predicciones audaces que son correctas, pero penaliza las predicciones audaces que resultan estar equivocadas. Los mejores jugadores, medidos por puntajes acumulados en todos los juegos, ganan los premios del concurso. La estrategia sugerida en el sitio web del concurso es hacer selecciones para cada juego que coincida, lo más cerca posible, las probabilidades de que cada equipo gane. Esta estrategia es correcta si el participante busca maximizar el puntaje esperado. Sin embargo, como los premios se otorgan solo a los pocos ganadores principales, los objetivos de los participantes son maximizar la probabilidad de ganar, no maximizar el puntaje esperado, lo que resulta en una optimización ligeramente diferente y más de búsqueda de riesgos.1 Aún así, hasta donde sabemos,Estos datos ofrecen lo más cercano disponible para los verdaderos juicios de probabilidad subjetiva de tantas personas en tantos eventos públicos que tienen los mercados de información correspondientes.4.2 Métodos de análisis Para comparar la precisión de la predicción de los mercados de la información y la de los grupos de opinión, procedemos a obtener predicciones de los datos del mercado de los deportes comerciales y las noticias de noticias, forman opiniones agrupadas utilizando datos de expertos del concurso de Football de probabilidad y especificamos que las medidas de rendimiento seanusado.4.2.1 Derir predicciones para los mercados de la información, derivar predicciones es sencilla. Podemos tomar el precio de seguridad y dividirlo en 100 para obtener la predicción de los mercados de la probabilidad de que un equipo gane. Para igualar el momento en que los participantes en el concurso Probabilidadfootball deben informar sus evaluaciones de probabilidad, obtenemos predicciones utilizando el último precio comercial antes del mediodía del día del juego. Para más 1 idealmente, la lotería otorgará premios en proporción a la puntuación acumulada.de la mitad de los juegos, esta vez es solo una hora antes de la hora de inicio del juego, mientras que es varias horas antes para otros juegos. Se derivan dos conjuntos de predicciones del mercado: • NF: la predicción es igual a las noticias del último precio comercial antes del mediodía del día del juego dividido por 100. • TS: la predicción es igual a los deportes comerciales el último precio comercial antes del mediodía del día del juego dividido por 100. Aplicamos Linop y Logop a los datos de Probabilidadfootball para obtener predicciones de expertos agregados. La razón por la que no consideramos que otros métodos de agregación incluyan: (1) los datos del probabilidad de bola de probabilidad solo son adecuados para los métodos de agrupación matemática.Resultados y la función de probabilidad de las opiniones de expertos: dada la gran cantidad de juegos y participantes, hacer suposiciones razonables es difícil, y (3) para enfoques axiomáticos, investigaciones previas han demostrado que los métodos de agregación más simples a menudo funcionan mejor que los métodos más complejos [12] [12]. Debido a que la salida del logop es indeterminada si hay evaluaciones de probabilidad de 0 y 1 (y debido a que las evaluaciones de 0 y 1 son dictatoriales usando Logop), agregamos un pequeño número 0.01 a una opinión experta si es 0 y restamos 0.01 deEs si es 1. Al agrupar las opiniones, consideramos dos factores influyentes: pesos de expertos y el número de opiniones de expertos que se agruparán. Para los pesos de los expertos, experimentamos con los mismos pesos y los pesos basados en el rendimiento. Los pesos basados en el rendimiento se determinan según el puntaje acumulado anterior en el concurso. El puntaje para cada juego se calcula de acuerdo con la Ecuación 3, la regla de puntuación utilizada en el concurso de Probabilidadfootball. Durante la primera semana, dado que no hay puntajes anteriores disponibles, elegimos pesos iguales. Para las últimas semanas, calculamos los puntajes pasados acumulados para cada jugador. Debido a que los puntajes acumulativos pueden ser negativos, cambiamos la puntuación de todos si es necesario para garantizar que los pesos no sean negativos. Por lo tanto, wi = scatteri acumulativo + cambio n j = 1 (cambio de tutterj + acumulativo).(4) donde el cambio es igual a 0 si el marcador acumulativo más pequeño no es negativo, y es igual al valor absoluto del puntaje acumulativo más pequeño de lo contrario. Para simplificar, llamamos a un grupo de opinión ponderado por el rendimiento como un grupo de opinión ponderado e igualmente ponderado como no ponderado. Los usaremos indistintamente en el resto del papel. En cuanto a la cantidad de opiniones utilizadas en un grupo de opinión, formamos diferentes grupos de opinión con un número diferente de expertos. Solo se seleccionan los expertos en mejor desempeño. Por ejemplo, para formar un grupo de opinión con 20 opiniones de expertos, elegimos los 20 principales participantes. Dado que no hay registro de rendimiento para la primera semana, utilizamos opiniones de todos los participantes en la primera semana. Para la Semana 2, seleccionamos opiniones de 20 personas cuyos puntajes en la primera semana se encuentran entre los 20 principales. Para la semana 3, 20 individuos cuyas puntuaciones acumuladas de la Semana 1 y 2 se encuentran entre los 20 principales se seleccionan. Los expertos son elegidos de manera similar para las semanas posteriores. Por lo tanto, los 20 principales participantes pueden cambiar de una semana a otra. Los posibles grupos de opinión, variados en las funciones de agrupación, los métodos de ponderación y el número de opiniones de expertos, se muestran 61 Tabla 1: Predicciones de expertos agrupados # Símbolo Descripción 1 Lin-All-U UNH-UN-SIN ELLA (igualmente ponderado) Lino de todos los expertos.2 Linop ponderado (ponderado en rendimiento) Lin-todo de todos los expertos.3 Lin-N-U sin ponderación (igualmente ponderada) Linop con n expertos.4 Linop ponderado LIN-N (ponderado en rendimiento) con N expertos.5 log-todo logop sin ponderación (igualmente ponderado) de todos los expertos.6 logop logop-w ponderado (ponderado en rendimiento) de todos los expertos.7 log-n-U LOGOP no ponderado (igualmente ponderado) con n expertos.8 Logop ponderado log-N (ponderado en rendimiento) con n expertos.en la Tabla 1. Lin representa lineal, y el registro representa logarítmico.N es el número de opiniones de expertos que se agrupan, y todo indica que todas las opiniones se combinan. Te usamos para simbolizar grupos de opinión no ponderados (igualmente ponderados).W se usa para grupos de opinión ponderados (ponderados en rendimiento). Lin-All-U, el linop igualmente ponderado con todos los participantes, es básicamente la media aritmética de las opiniones de todos los participantes. Log-All-U es simplemente la media geométrica de todas las opiniones. Cuando un participante no entró en una predicción para un juego en particular, ese participante fue eliminado del grupo de opinión para ese juego. Esto contrasta con el promedio de Football de probabilidad reportado en el sitio web del concurso y utilizado por Servan-Schreiber et.Al [36], donde las predicciones no reportadas se convirtieron en 0.5 predicciones de probabilidad.4.2.2 Medidas de rendimiento Utilizamos tres métricas comunes para evaluar la precisión de la predicción de los mercados de información y los grupos de opinión. Estas medidas han sido utilizadas por Servan-Schreiber et.Al [36] al evaluar la precisión de la predicción de los mercados de la información.1. Error absoluto = Prob Lost, donde la pérdida de problemas es la probabilidad asignada al equipo perdedor eventual. El error absoluto simplemente mide la diferencia entre una predicción perfecta (1 para el equipo ganador) y la predicción real. Una predicción con un error absoluto más bajo es más precisa.2. Puntuación cuadrática = 100 - 400 × (Prob Lose2). La puntuación cuadrática es la función de puntuación que se usa en el concurso de Probabilidadfootball. Es una transformación lineal del error al cuadrado, Prob Lose2, que es una de las métricas principalmente utilizadas para evaluar la precisión de pronóstico. La puntuación cuadrática puede ser negativa. Una predicción con una puntuación cuadrática más alta es más precisa.3. Puntuación logarítmica = log (prob W in), donde el problema W in es la probabilidad asignada al equipo ganador eventual. La puntuación logarítmica, como la puntuación cuadrática, es una regla de puntuación adecuada. Una predicción con una puntuación logarítmica más alta (menos negativa) es más precisa.5. Resultados empíricos 5.1 Rendimiento de grupos de opinión Dependiendo de cuántas opiniones se usan, puede haber numerosos grupos de opinión diferentes. Primero examinamos el efecto del número de opiniones sobre la precisión de la predicción al formar grupos de opinión con el número de opiniones de expertos que varían de 1 a 960. En la competencia Probabilidadfootball, no todos los participantes registrados de 1966 proporcionan sus evaluaciones de probabilidad para cada juego.960 es el menor número de participantes para todos los juegos. Para cada juego, clasificamos a los expertos de acuerdo con su puntaje cuadrático acumulado en las semanas anteriores. Las predicciones de los participantes de mejor desempeño se eligen para formar un grupo de opinión con N expertos. La Figura 1 muestra la precisión de predicción de Linop y Logop en términos de valores medios de las tres medidas de rendimiento en los 210 juegos. Podemos ver las siguientes tendencias en la figura.1. Los grupos de opinión no ponderados y los grupos de opinión ponderados por el rendimiento tienen niveles similares de precisión de predicción, especialmente para Linop.2. Para Linop, el aumento del número de expertos en general aumenta o mantiene el mismo nivel de precisión de predicción. Cuando hay más de 200 expertos, la precisión de predicción de Linop es estable con respecto al número de expertos.3. Logop parece más preciso que Linop en términos de error absoluto medio. Pero, utilizando todas las demás medidas de rendimiento, Linop supera a Logop.4. Para Logop, aumentar el número de expertos aumenta la precisión de la predicción al principio. Pero las curvas (incluidos los puntos con todos los expertos) para la puntuación cuadrática media, y la puntuación logarítmica media tiene formas de campana ligeras, que representan una disminución en la precisión de la predicción cuando el número de expertos es muy grande. Las curvas para un error absoluto medio, por otro lado, muestran un aumento constante de la precisión. La primera y segunda tendencia anterior implica que cuando se usa Lino, la forma más simple, que tiene una buena precisión de predicción, es promediar las opiniones de todos los expertos. La ponderación no parece mejorar el rendimiento. Seleccionar expertos de acuerdo con el rendimiento anterior tampoco ayuda. Es una observación muy interesante de que incluso si muchos participantes del concurso Probabilidadfootball no proporcionan predicciones individuales precisas (tienen puntajes cuadráticos negativos en el concurso), incluidas sus opiniones en el grupo de opinión aún aumenta la precisión de la predicción. Una explicación de este fenómeno podría ser que los sesgos de juicio individual pueden compensarse entre sí cuando las opiniones son diversas, lo que hace que la predicción agrupada sea más precisa. La tercera tendencia presenta una controversia. La precisión de la predicción relativa de Logop y Linop se voltea cuando se usa diferentes medidas de precisión. Para investigar este desacuerdo, trazamos el error absoluto de log-todo-u y Lin-all-u para cada juego en la Figura 2. Cuando el error absoluto de una opinión 62 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Todos 0.4 0.405 0.41 0.415 0.42 0.425 0.43 0.435 0.44 0.445 0.45 Número de opiniones de expertos Lin -e -e -eSoluteError no metida lineal Lingaro lineal lineal logarítmicoAll - W log - All - U log - All - W (a) Media Error absoluto 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 All 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 Número de opiniones de expertos Mediaquadraticscore no ponderado lineal lineal lineal linealLogarítmico no ponderado logarítmico Lin -All - Ul - All - W log - All - ALL - ALL - W 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Todos −0.71 −0.7 −0.69 −0.68 −0.67 −0.66 −0.65 −0.64 −0.63 −0.62 Número de opiniones de expertos MeanLogarithmicscore no ponderado lineal lineal lineal no ponderado logarítmico logarítmico lin -all -u lin - all -w log - todo -u log - todo - v (b) calificación cuadrática (c) logaritmic medio logarítmicoFigura 1: La precisión de la predicción del grupo de grupos de opinión para un juego es inferior a 0.5, significa que el equipo favorecido por el grupo de opinión gana el juego. Si es mayor que 0.5, el desvalido gana. En comparación con Lin-All-U, log-all-U tiene un error absoluto más bajo cuando es inferior a 0.5, y un error absoluto mayor cuando es mayor que 0.5, lo que indica que las predicciones de log-todo son son más audaces, más cercanosa 0 o 1, que los de Lin-All-U. Esto se debe a la naturaleza de las funciones de agregación lineal y logarítmica. Debido a que la puntuación cuadrática y la puntuación logarítmica penalizan las predicciones en negrita que están mal, Logop es menos preciso cuando se mide en estos términos. El razonamiento similar explica la cuarta tendencia. Cuando hay más de 500 expertos, el número creciente de expertos utilizados en LOGOP mejora la precisión de la predicción medida por error absoluto, pero empeora la precisión medida por las otras dos métricas. Al examinar las opiniones de expertos, encontramos que los participantes que se clasifican más bajos son más frecuentes en ofrecer predicciones extremas (0 o 1) que aquellos que se clasifican en la lista. Cuando aumentamos el número de expertos en un grupo de opinión, estamos incorporando predicciones más extremas en él. El logop resultante es más audaz y, por lo tanto, tiene una puntuación cuadrática media más baja y una puntuación logarítmica media.5.2 Comparación de los mercados de información y los grupos de opinión a través de la primera selección de varios grupos de opinión, seleccionamos Lin-All-U, Log-All-U, Log-All-W y Log-200-U para comparar las predicciones de los mercados de la información. Lin-All-U como se muestra en la Figura 1 puede representar lo que Linop puede lograr. Sin embargo, el rendimiento de Logop no es consistente cuando se evalúa utilizando diferentes métricas. Log-all-u y log-todo w ofrecen las mejores o las peores predicciones. Log-200-U, el logop con los 200 expertos de mejor rendimiento, proporciona predicciones más estables. Utilizamos los tres para representar el rendimiento de Logop en nuestra comparación posterior. Si una predicción de la probabilidad de que un equipo gane un juego, ya sea de un grupo de opinión o un mercado de la información, es superior a 0.5, decimos que el equipo es el favorito predicho para el juego. La Tabla 2 presenta el número y el porcentaje de juegos que predijeron que los favoritos realmente ganan, de un total de 210 juegos. Los cuatro grupos de opinión predicen correctamente un número y porcentaje similares de juegos que NF y TS. Dado que NF, TS y los cuatro grupos de opinión forman sus predicciones utilizando la información disponible al mediodía del Juego 63 Tabla 2: Número y porcentaje de juegos que predijeron los favoritos ganan NF TS LIN-ALL-U LOG-ALL-U LOG-ALL-w Log-200-u Number 142 137 144 144 143 141 Percentage 67.62% 65.24% 68.57% 68.57% 68.10% 67.14% Table 3: Mean of Prediction Accuracy Measures Absolute Error Quadratic Score Logarithmic Score NF 0.4253 15.4352 -0.6136 (0.0121) (4.6072) (0.0258) TS 0.4275 15.2739 -0.6121 (0.0118) (4.3982) (0.0241) Lin-All-U 0.4292 13.0525 -0.6260 (0.0126) (4.8088) (0.0268) logar 4) (0.0418) log-todo-W 0.4059 10.4491 -0.6497 (0.0168) (6.4440) (0.0398) log-200-u 0.4266 12.3868 -0.6319 (0.0133) (5.0764) (0.0295) *Los números en parécimos son errores estándar.*El mejor valor para cada métrica se muestra en negrita.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Error absoluto de Lin-All-U AbsolteErroroflog-All-U 45 Línea de grado Error absoluto Figura 2: Error absoluto: Lin-ALL-U vs. Log-All-U Day, los mercados de información y los grupos de opinión tienen un potencial comparable en el mismo punto de tiempo. Luego analizamos más de cerca la precisión de la predicción de los mercados de información y los grupos de opinión utilizando las tres medidas de rendimiento. La Tabla 3 muestra valores medios de estas medidas en 210 juegos. Los números entre paréntesis son errores estándar, que estiman la desviación estándar de la media. Para tener en cuenta la asimetría de las distribuciones, también informamos valores medios de medidas de precisión en la Tabla 4. A juzgado por los valores medios de las medidas de precisión en la Tabla 3, todos los métodos tienen niveles de precisión similares, con NF y TS ligeramente mejor que los grupos de opinión. Sin embargo, los valores medios de las medidas de precisión indican que los grupos de opinión logall-u y log-whw son más precisos que todas las demás predicciones. Empleamos la prueba de aleatorización [32] para estudiar si las diferencias en la precisión de la predicción presentadas en la Tabla 3 y la Tabla 4 son estadísticamente significativas. La idea básica de la prueba de aleatorización es que, al intercambiar predicciones aleatorias de dos métodos en numerosas ocasiones, se puede construir una distribución empírica para la diferencia de precisión de predicción. Usando esta distribución empírica, podemos evaluar que en qué nivel de confianza la diferencia observada refleja una diferencia real. Por ejemplo, el error absoluto medio de NF es más alto que el de log-todo-U por 0.0229, como se muestra en la Tabla 3. Para probar si esta diferencia es estadísticamente significativa, shu ﬄ e predicciones de dos métodos, etiqueta aleatoriamente la mitad de las predicciones como NF y la otra mitad como log-todo U, y calculamos la diferencia de error absoluto medio de la recién formada NF y log-Datos All-U. El procedimiento anterior se repite 10,000 veces. Las 10,000 diferencias de error absoluto medio dan como resultado una distribución empírica de la diferencia. Comparando nuestra diferencia observada, 0.0229, con esta distribución, encontramos que la diferencia observada es mayor que el 75.37% de las diferencias empíricas. Esto nos lleva a concluir que la diferencia de error absoluto medio entre NF y Log-All-U no es estadísticamente significativo, si elegimos el nivel de importancia de ser 0.05. La Tabla 5 y la Tabla 6 son resultados de la prueba de aleatorización para diferencias media y mediana, respectivamente. Cada celda de la tabla es para dos métodos de predicción diferentes, representados por el nombre de la fila y el nombre de la columna. Las primeras líneas de las células de la tabla son resultados para un error absoluto. La segunda y tercera líneas están dedicadas a la puntuación cuadrática y la puntuación logarítmica respectivamente. Podemos ver que, en términos de valores medios de medidas de precisión, las diferencias de todos los métodos no son estadísticamente significativas en ningún grado razonable.

Estos resultados indican que las diferencias en la precisión de la predicción entre los mercados de la información y los grupos de opinión no son estadísticamente significativas. Esto puede parecer contradecir el resultado de Servan-Schreiber et.Al [36], en el que se ha demostrado que los mercados de la información de los NewsfutureS proporcionan predicciones estadísticamente significativamente más precisas que el promedio (no ponderado) de todas las opiniones de probabilidad de fútbol. La discrepancia surge al tratar con los datos faltantes. No todos los participantes de Probabilidad registrada de 1966 ofrecen evaluaciones de probabilidad para cada juego. Cuando un participante no proporciona una evaluación de probabilidad para un juego, el concurso considera su predicción como 0.5. Esto tiene sentido en el contexto del concurso, ya que 0.5 siempre produce 0 puntaje cuadrático. El promedio de Football de probabilidad informado en el sitio web del concurso y utilizado por Servan-Schreiber et.Al incluye estas 0.5 estimaciones. En cambio, eliminamos a los participantes de los juegos que no proporcionan evaluaciones, agrupando solo las opiniones disponibles. Nuestro tratamiento aumenta la precisión de la predicción de Lin-All-U significativamente.6. Conclusiones Con el rápido crecimiento de Internet, los mercados de la información se han convertido recientemente en una herramienta alternativa para predecir eventos futuros. Investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que los mercados de la información dan predicciones precisas o más precisas que los expertos y encuestas individuales. Sin embargo, los mercados de la información, como un mecanismo adaptativo para agregar opiniones diferentes de los participantes del mercado, no se han calibrado frente a muchos métodos de agregación de creencias. En este artículo, comparamos la precisión de la predicción de los mercados de información con grupos de opinión lineal y logarítmica (Linop y Logop) utilizando predicciones de dos mercados y 1966 con respecto a los resultados de 210 juegos de fútbol americano durante la temporada 2003 de la NFL. En la detección de grupos de opinión representativos para comparar con los mercados de la información, investigamos el efecto de los pesos y el número de expertos en la precisión de la predicción. Nuestros resultados tanto en la comparación de los mercados de la información como en los grupos de opinión y el desempeño relativo de diferentes grupos de opinión se resumen a continuación.1. En el mismo punto de tiempo antes de los eventos, los mercados de información ofrecen predicciones precisas como nuestros grupos de opinión seleccionados. Hemos seleccionado cuatro grupos de opinión para representar el nivel de precisión de predicción que Linop y Logop pueden lograr. Con las cuatro métricas de rendimiento, nuestros dos mercados de información obtienen una precisión de predicción similar como los cuatro grupos de opinión.65 Tabla 6: Confianza estadística de las diferencias medianas en la precisión de la predicción TS LIN-ALL-U LOG-ALL-ULA-U LOG-ALL-W LOG-200-U NF 48.85% 47.3% 84.8% 77.9% 65.36% 45.26% 44.55% 85.27%75.65% 66.75% 44.89% 46.04% 84.43% 77.16% 64.78% TS 5.18% 94.83% 94.31% 0% 5.37% 92.08% 92.53% 0% 7.41% 95.62% 91.09% 0% Lin-All-Ul-U 95.11% 91.37% 7.31%96.10% 92.69% 9.84% 95.45% 95.12% 7.79% log-todo-U 23.47% 95.89% 26.68% 93.85% 22.47% 96.42% log-todo-w 91.3% 91.4% 90.37% *En cada celda de tabla, fila 1 cuentas para las cuentas para las cuentas de 1 cuentas paraError absoluto, fila 2 para puntaje cuadrático y fila 3 para puntaje logarítmico.*La confianza por encima del 95% se muestra en negrita.2. El promedio aritmético de todas las opiniones (Lin-All-U) es un grupo de opinión simple, robusto y eficiente. Simplemente promediar en todos los expertos parece dar como resultado mejores predicciones que las opiniones individuales y los grupos de opinión con algunos expertos. Es bastante robusto en el sentido de que incluso si las predicciones individuales incluidas son menos precisas, promediando todas las opiniones todavía da predicciones mejores (o igualmente buenas).3. La ponderación de las opiniones de los expertos de acuerdo con el rendimiento anterior no parece mejorar significativamente la precisión de la predicción de Linop o Logop. Comparando grupos de opinión ponderados por el rendimiento con grupos de opinión igualmente ponderados, no observamos mucha diferencia en términos de precisión de predicción. Dado que solo usamos un método de peso de rendimiento, calculando los pesos de acuerdo con la puntuación cuadrática acumulada pasada que los participantes ganaron, esto podría deberse al método de ponderación que elegimos.4. LOGOP produce predicciones más audaces que Linop. LOGOP produce predicciones que están más cerca de los extremos, 0 o 1. Un mercado de la información es un mecanismo autoorganizado para agregar información y hacer predicciones. En comparación con los grupos de opinión, está menos limitado por el espacio y el tiempo, y puede eliminar los esfuerzos para identificar expertos y decidir los métodos de agregación de creencias. Pero las ventajas no comprometen su precisión de predicción en ninguna medida. Por el contrario, los mercados de la información pueden proporcionar predicciones en tiempo real, que apenas se pueden lograr a través del recurso a los expertos. En el futuro, estamos interesados en explorar más a fondo: • Comparación de rendimiento de los mercados de información con otros grupos de opinión y procedimientos de agregación matemática. En este documento, solo comparamos los mercados de información con dos grupos de opinión simples, lineal y logarítmico. Será significativo investigar su precisión de predicción relativa con otros métodos de agregación de creencias, como los enfoques bayesianos. También hay una serie de algoritmos de expertos teóricos con límites de rendimiento de peor de los casos probados [10] cuyo rendimiento promedio o práctico sería instructivo para investigar.• Si definir la experiencia más estrechamente puede mejorar las predicciones de los grupos de opinión. En nuestro análisis, tratamos ampliamente a los participantes del concurso Probabilidadfootball como expertos en todos los juegos. Si definimos la experiencia más limitada, seleccionando expertos en ciertos equipos de fútbol para predecir juegos que involucran a estos equipos, ¿serán las predicciones de los grupos de opinión más precisas?• La posibilidad de combinar los mercados de información con otros métodos de pronóstico para lograr una mejor precisión de predicción. Chen, Fine y Huberman [11] utilizan un mercado de la información para determinar la actitud de riesgo de los participantes, y luego realizan una agregación no lineal de sus predicciones en función de sus actitudes de riesgo. Se muestra que el mecanismo de agregación no lineal supera tanto al mercado como a los mejores participantes individuales. Es digno de más atención si los mercados de la información, como un método de pronóstico alternativo, pueden usarse junto con otros métodos para mejorar nuestras predicciones.7.

        "Our results show that, at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as pooled expert assessments.",
        "In screening pooled expert predictions, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performance does not improve accuracy of pooled predictions; and logarithmic aggregation functions offer bolder predictions than linear aggregation functions.",
        "The results provide insights into the predictive performance of information markets, and the relative merits of selecting among various opinion pooling methods.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-economics General Terms Economics, Performance 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies.",
        "For decades, scientists have been developing and exploring various forecasting methods, which can be roughly divided into statistical and non-statistical approaches.",
        "Statistical approaches require not only the existence of enough historical data but also that past data contains valuable information about the future event.",
        "When these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on judgmental information about the future event could be better choices.",
        "One widely used non-statistical method is to elicit opinions from experts.",
        "Since experts are not generally in agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a single prediction.",
        "These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].",
        "With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical forecasting tool.",
        "Information markets (sometimes called prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are markets designed for aggregating information and making predictions about future events.",
        "To form the predictions, information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of events.",
        "For example, in an information market to predict the result of a US professional National Football League (NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if New England wins the game.",
        "Otherwise, it pays off nothing.",
        "The security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the probability of New England winning the game.",
        "Such markets are becoming very popular.",
        "The Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) [2] are real-money futures markets to predict economic and political events such as elections.",
        "The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) [3] is a virtual (play-money) exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment awards, etc.",

        "Despite the popularity of information markets, one of the most important questions to ask is: how accurately can information markets predict?",
        "Previous research in general shows that information markets are remarkably accurate.",
        "The political election markets at IEM predict the election outcomes better than polls [16, 17, 18, 19].",
        "Prices in HSX and FX have been found to give as accurate or more accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33, 34, 37].",
        "However, information markets have not been calibrated against opinion pools, except for Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which the authors compare two information markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions.",
        "Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.",
        "The comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to choose the most appropriate method for their needs.",
        "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",
        "In terms of prediction accuracy, we compare two information markets with several linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) at predicting the results of NFL games.",
        "Our results show that at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools.",
        "In selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy of opinion pools; and LogOP offers bolder predictions than LinOP.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews popular opinion pooling methods.",
        "Section 3 introduces the basics of information markets.",
        "Data sets and our analysis methods are described in Section 4.",
        "We present results and analysis in Section 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6. 2. REVIEW OF OPINION POOLS Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches and behavioral approaches.",
        "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
        "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
        "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
        "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
        "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
        "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
        "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
        "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
        "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
        "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
        "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
        "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
        "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
        "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
        "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
        "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
        "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
        "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
        "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
        "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
        "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
        "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
        "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
        "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
        "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
        "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
        "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
        "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
        "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
        "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
        "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
        "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
        "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
        "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
        "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
        "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
        "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
        "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
        "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
        "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
        "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
        "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
        "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
        "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
        "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
        "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
        "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
        "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
        "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
        "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
        "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
        "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
        "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
        "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
        "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
        "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
        "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
        "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
        "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
        "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
        "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
        "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
        "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
        "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
        "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
        "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
        "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
        "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
        "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
        "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
        "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
        "The contest is free to enter.",
        "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
        "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
        "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
        "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
        "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
        "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
        "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
        "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
        "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
        "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
        "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
        "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",
        "For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.",
        "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
        "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
        "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
        "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
        "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
        "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
        "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
        "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
        "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
        "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",
        "Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.",
        "Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.",
        "For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.",
        "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",
        "As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts.",
        "Only the best performing experts are selected.",
        "For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.",
        "Since there is no performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all participants in the first week.",
        "For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20.",
        "For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected.",

        "The curves for mean absolute error, on the other hand, show a consistent increase of accuracy.",
        "The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.",
        "Weighting does not seem to improve performance.",
        "Selecting experts according to past performance also does not help.",
        "It is a very interesting observation that even if many participants of the ProbabilityFootball contest do not provide accurate individual predictions (they have negative quadratic scores in the contest), including their opinions into the opinion pool still increases the prediction accuracy.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
                "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
                "The contest is free to enter.",
                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
                "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",
                "For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.",
                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
                "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
                "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",
                "Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.",
                "Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.",
                "For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.",
                "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",
                "As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts.",
                "Only the best performing experts are selected.",
                "For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.",

                "Statistical approaches require not only the existence of enough historical data but also that past data contains valuable information about the future event.",
                "When these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on judgmental information about the future event could be better choices.",
                "One widely used non-statistical method is to elicit opinions from experts.",
                "Since experts are not generally in agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a single prediction.",
                "These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].",
                "With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical forecasting tool.",
                "Information markets (sometimes called prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are markets designed for aggregating information and making predictions about future events.",
                "To form the predictions, information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of events.",
                "For example, in an <br>information market</br> to predict the result of a US professional National Football League (NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if New England wins the game.",

                "The security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the probability of New England winning the game.",

                "Despite the popularity of information markets, one of the most important questions to ask is: how accurately can information markets predict?",

                "Prices in HSX and FX have been found to give as accurate or more accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33, 34, 37].",
                "However, information markets have not been calibrated against opinion pools, except for Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which the authors compare two information markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions.",
                "Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.",
                "The comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to choose the most appropriate method for their needs.",
                "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",

                "We present results and analysis in Section 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6. 2. REVIEW OF OPINION POOLS Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches and behavioral approaches.",
                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an <br>information market</br> can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective <br>information market</br>.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "<br>information market</br> data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all <br>information market</br> to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an <br>information market</br> [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",

                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",

                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",

                "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",

                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",

                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",

                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",

                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",

                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",

                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
                "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
                "The contest is free to enter.",
                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
                "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",
                "For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.",
                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",

                "These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].",

                "Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.",

                "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the <br>price</br> system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the <br>price</br> of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market <br>price</br> summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market <br>price</br>, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security <br>price</br> should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the <br>price</br> should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the <br>price</br> of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security <br>price</br> p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its <br>price</br> predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",

                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",

                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",

                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",

                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",

                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",

                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",

                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",

                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",

                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",

                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
                "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
                "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",

                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
                "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
                "The contest is free to enter.",
                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
                "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",
                "For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.",
                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",

                "These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].",

                "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain <br>future event</br>, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a <br>future event</br> such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",

                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",

                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",

                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
                "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
                "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",
                "Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.",
                "Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.",
                "For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.",
                "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",
                "As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts.",
                "Only the best performing experts are selected.",
                "For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.",
                "Since there is no performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all participants in the first week.",
                "For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20.",
                "For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected.",

                "The first and second trend above imply that when using LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts.",

                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",

                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",

                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",

                "INTRODUCTION Forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies.",
                "For decades, scientists have been developing and exploring various forecasting methods, which can be roughly divided into statistical and non-statistical approaches.",
                "Statistical approaches require not only the existence of enough historical data but also that past data contains valuable information about the future event.",
                "When these conditions can not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on judgmental information about the future event could be better choices.",
                "One widely used non-statistical method is to elicit opinions from experts.",
                "Since experts are not generally in agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a single prediction.",
                "These belief aggregation methods are called opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and applied in many domains such as group decision making [29] and risk analysis [12].",
                "With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical forecasting tool.",
                "Information markets (sometimes called prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are markets designed for aggregating information and making predictions about future events.",
                "To form the predictions, information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of events.",
                "For example, in an information market to predict the result of a US professional National Football League (NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if and only if New England wins the game.",
                "Otherwise, it pays off nothing.",
                "The security price before the game reflects the consensus expectation of market traders about the probability of New England winning the game.",
                "Such markets are becoming very popular.",
                "The Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) [2] are real-money futures markets to predict economic and political events such as elections.",
                "The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) [3] is a virtual (play-money) exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment awards, etc.",

                "The Foresight Exchange (FX) [4] allows traders to wager play money on unresolved scientific questions or other claims of public interest, and NewsFutures.coms World News Exchange [1] has 58 popular sports and financial betting markets, also grounded in a play-money currency.",
                "Despite the popularity of information markets, one of the most important questions to ask is: how accurately can information markets predict?",
                "Previous research in general shows that information markets are remarkably accurate.",
                "The political election markets at IEM predict the election outcomes better than polls [16, 17, 18, 19].",
                "Prices in HSX and FX have been found to give as accurate or more accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33, 34, 37].",
                "However, information markets have not been calibrated against opinion pools, except for Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which the authors compare two information markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions.",
                "Since information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of information markets from another perspective.",
                "The comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to choose the most appropriate method for their needs.",
                "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",
                "In terms of prediction accuracy, we compare two information markets with several linear and logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) at predicting the results of NFL games.",
                "Our results show that at the same time point ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools.",
                "In selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling function; weighting expert assessments according to their past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy of opinion pools; and LogOP offers bolder predictions than LinOP.",
                "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 reviews popular opinion pooling methods.",
                "Section 3 introduces the basics of information markets.",
                "Data sets and our analysis methods are described in Section 4.",
                "We present results and analysis in Section 5, followed by conclusions in Section 6. 2. REVIEW OF OPINION POOLS Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches and behavioral approaches.",
                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all <br>contract</br>.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index <br>contract</br>.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
                "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
                "The contest is free to enter.",
                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
                "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",
                "For more 1 Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion to accumulated score. than half of the games, this time is only about an hour earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours earlier for other games.",
                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
                "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
                "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",
                "Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.",
                "Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.",
                "For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.",
                "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",
                "As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts.",
                "Only the best performing experts are selected.",
                "For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.",
                "Since there is no performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all participants in the first week.",
                "For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20.",
                "For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected.",
                "Experts are chosen in a similar way for later weeks.",
                "Thus, the top 20 participants can change from week to week.",

                "This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) As an initial attempt to compare information markets with opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better understanding of information markets and their promise as an alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2) In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we cast insights into relative performances of different opinion pools.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",
                "It predicts the expected value of a future outcome.",
                "Many other aspects of a future event such as median value of outcome can also be predicted in information markets by designing and trading different securities.",
                "Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main types of securities traded in information markets and what statistical properties they can predict.",
                "In practice, conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the many decisions in designing an effective information market.",
                "Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for designing information markets. 4.",
                "DESIGN OF ANALYSIS 4.1 Data Sets Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003.",
                "NFL games are very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that provide data on both information markets and the opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2) the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides natural incentives for people to participate in information markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of information markets and improves the quality and number of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and individual players provide the public with much information so that participants of information markets and the contest can be viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.",
                "Information market data was acquired, by using a specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.coms Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.coms Sports Exchange [1].",
                "For each NFL game, both TradeSports and NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to predict the game outcome.",
                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",
                "They trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off 100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.",
                "Small differences exist in how they deal with ties.",
                "In the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the security is worth 50 in NewsFutures.",
                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",
                "TradeSports is a real-money exchange.",
                "A trader needs to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100 to participate in the market.",
                "Both profits and losses can occur as a result of trading activity.",
                "On the contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the time of registration.",
                "Traders at NewsFutures will not incur any real financial loss.",
                "They can accumulate virtual money by trading securities.",
                "The virtual money can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at NewsFutures online shop. • Financial market design: Both markets at TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double auction as their trading mechanism.",
                "TradeSports charges a small fee on each security transaction and expiry, while NewsFutures does not.",
                "We can see that the main difference between two information markets is real money vs. virtual money.",
                "Servan-Schreiber 60 et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the performance of the two information markets and concluded that the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the same level.",
                "Not intending to compare these two markets, we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our findings are not accidental.",
                "We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5], one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6].",
                "The contest is free to enter.",
                "Participants of the contest are asked to enter their subjective probability that a team will win a game by noon on the day of the game.",
                "Importantly, the contest evaluates the participants performance via the quadratic scoring rule: s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2 , (3) where s represents the score that a participant earns for the game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant assigns to the actual losing team.",
                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",
                "For example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter which team wins.",
                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",
                "The top players, measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes of the contest.",
                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the prediction accuracy of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",

                "In mathematical approaches, the opinions of individual experts are expressed as subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an uncertain event.",
                "They are combined through various mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability distribution.",
                "Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches.",
                "Mathematical approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic approaches and Bayesian approaches.",
                "Axiomatic approaches apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to a single aggregated probability distribution.",
                "These pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable properties.",
                "Two of the most common pooling functions are the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP).",
                "Using LinOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = n i=1 wipi(θ), (1) where pi(θ) is expert is probability distribution of uncertain event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability distribution, wis are weights for experts, which are usually nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts.",
                "Using LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted geometric mean of individual probability distributions: p(θ) = k n i=1 pi(θ)wi , (2) where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled opinion is a probability distribution.",
                "Other axiomatic pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23], or both [13].",
                "Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods.",
                "Bayesian approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood function over expert opinions given the event.",
                "This decision maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule.",
                "The resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled opinion.",
                "Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the field of group decision making and organizational behavior.",
                "The important assumption of behavioral approaches is that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts can eventually reach an equilibrium where further interaction wont change their opinions.",
                "One of the best known behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28].",
                "Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other experts, and is given feedback.",
                "Experts then can reassess their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a smaller spread of opinions is achieved.",
                "Some other behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14], promote open discussions in controlled environments.",
                "Each approach has its pros and cons.",
                "Axiomatic approaches are easy to use.",
                "But they dont have a normative basis to choose weights.",
                "In addition, several impossibility results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool, unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual opinion, which effectively implies a dictator.",
                "Bayesian approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian framework.",
                "However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional independence of experts.",
                "Behavior approaches allow experts to dynamically improve their information and revise their opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or completely specified, and cant guarantee convergence or repeatability. 59 3.",
                "HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market hypothesis [15].",
                "Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in 1940s, claims that the price system in a competitive market is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed information among market participants.",
                "The efficient market hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the price of a security almost instantly incorporates all available information.",
                "The market price summarizes all relevant information across traders, hence is the market participants consensus expectation about the future value of the security.",
                "Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large extent [25, 27, 35].",
                "Thus, when associating the value of a security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event.",
                "This idea gives rise to information markets.",
                "For example, if we want to predict which team will win the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an information market can trade a security $100 if New England defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the game is specified as follow: $100 if New England wins the game; $0 otherwise.",
                "The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff of the security in an efficient market.",
                "The time value of money usually can be ignored because durations of most information markets are short.",
                "Assuming exposure to risk is roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players in the market.",
                "Thus, p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0, where p is the price of the security $100 if New England defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability that New England will win the game.",
                "Observing the security price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win), which is the market participants collective prediction about how likely it is that New England will win the game.",
                "The above security is a winner-takes-all contract.",
                "It is used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary).",
                "Its price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be realized.",
                "When the outcome of a prediction problem can be any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security that pays its holder proportional to the realized value.",
                "This kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called an index contract.",

                "We introduce the design of the two markets according to Spann and Skieras three steps for designing an information market [37] as below. • Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one of the two teams will win a NFL football game.",

                "Since the probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%), prices at both markets effectively represent the market participants consensus assessment of the probability that the team will win. • Incentive for participation and information revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different incentives for participation and information revelation.",

                "The quadratic score is one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have the property that an experts expected score is maximized when the expert reports probabilities truthfully.",

                "If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to team B, showing that he is confident in team As winning, he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and lose 156 points if team B wins.",
                "This quadratic scoring rule rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold predictions that turn out to be wrong.",

                "The suggested strategy at the contest website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely as possible, the probabilities that each team will win.",
                "This strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize expected score.",
                "However, as prizes are awarded only to the top few winners, participants goals are to maximize the probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1 Still, as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing available to true subjective probability judgments from so many people over so many public events that have corresponding information markets. 4.2 Methods of Analysis In order to compare the <br>prediction accuracy</br> of information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive predictions from market data of TradeSports and NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures to be used. 4.2.1 Deriving Predictions For information markets, deriving predictions is straightforward.",
                "We can take the security price and divide it by 100 to get the markets prediction of the probability that a team will win.",
                "To match the time when participants at the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last trade price before noon on the day of the game.",

                "Two sets of market predictions are derived: • NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100. • TS: Prediction equals TradeSports last trade price before noon of the game day divided by 100.",
                "We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data to obtain aggregate expert predictions.",
                "The reason that we do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches, (2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the large number of games and participants, making reasonable assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches, previous research has shown that simpler aggregation methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].",
                "Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.",
                "In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors: weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be pooled.",
                "For weights of experts, we experiment with equal weights and performance-based weights.",
                "The performancebased weights are determined according to previous accumulated score in the contest.",
                "The score for each game is calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in the ProbabilityFootball contest.",
                "For the first week, since no previous scores are available, we choose equal weights.",
                "For later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each player.",
                "Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we shift everyones score if needed to ensure the weights are non-negative.",
                "Thus, wi = cumulative scorei + shift n j=1(cumulative scorej + shift) . (4) where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the smallest cumulative scorej otherwise.",
                "For simplicity, we call performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally weighted opinion pool as unweighted.",
                "We will use them interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.",
                "As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool, we form different opinion pools with different number of experts.",
                "Only the best performing experts are selected.",
                "For example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions, we choose the top 20 participants.",
                "Since there is no performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all participants in the first week.",
                "For week 2, we select opinions of 20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the top 20.",
