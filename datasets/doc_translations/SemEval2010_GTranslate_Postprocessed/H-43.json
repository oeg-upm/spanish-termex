This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample. It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure. The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage. Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features. Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors. Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks. Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION With the advance of the World Wide Web, more and more hypertext documents become available on the Web. Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs). Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on. Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges. In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining. For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents. The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem. However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them. Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them. For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects). Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more. From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable. On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures. It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable. For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article. To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration. To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other. For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog. In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links. However, link and content information have different properties. For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way. Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information. On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them. We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly. Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure. In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other. In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively. But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18]. In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors. Our model contains two components. The first component captures the content information. This component has a form similar to that of the latent topics in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8] in traditional information retrieval. That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors. The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members. A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students). It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori. Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data. Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors. However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the relationship of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs. Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge. This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model. In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links). By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly. In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links. Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content. Section 4 extends the basic framework and a few variants for fine tune. Section 5 shows the experiment results. Section 6 discusses the details of this approach and Section 7 concludes. 2. RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8]. LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space. The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space. The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space. Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space. The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents. Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages. In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities. Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs. Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities. He et al. [9] propose a clustering algorithm for web document clustering. The algorithm incorporates link structure and the co-citation patterns. In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph. The content information is only used for weighing the links by the textual similarity of both ends of the links. Zhang et al. [23] uses the undirected graph regularization framework for document classification. Achlioptas et al[2] decompose the web into hub and authority attributes then combine them with content. Zhou et al. [25] and [24] propose a directed graph regularization framework for semi-supervised learning. The framework combines the hub and authority information of web pages. But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework. Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors. Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5]. The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis. In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page. In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page. In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS. In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself. The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links. In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page. As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph. Taskar et al. [19] propose relational Markov networks (RMNs) for entity classification, by describing a conditional distribution of entity classes given entity attributes and relationships. The model was applied to web page classification, where web pages are entities and hyperlinks are treated as relationships. RMNs apply conditional random fields to define a set of potential functions on cliques of random variables, where the link structure provides hints to form the cliques. However the model does not give an off-the-shelf solution, because the success highly depends on the arts of designing the potential functions. On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation. The following are some work on combining documents and links, but the methods are loosely related to our approach. The experiments of [21] show that using terms from the linked document improves the classification accuracy. Chakrabarti et al.[3] use co-citation information in their classification model. Joachims et al.[11] combine text kernels and co-citation kernels for classification. Oh et al [16] use the Naive Bayesian frame to combine link information with content. 3. OUR APPROACH In this section we will first introduce a novel matrix factorization method, which is more suitable than conventional matrix factorization methods for link analysis. Then we will introduce our approach that jointly factorizes the document-term matrix and link matrix and obtains compact and highly indicative factors for representing documents or web pages. 3.1 Link Matrix Factorization Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V, E), where the vertex set V = {vi}n i=1 represents the web pages and the edge set E represents the hyperlinks between web pages. Let A = {asd} denotes the n×n adjacency matrix of G, which is also called the link matrix in this paper. For a pair of vertices, vs and vd, let asd = 1 when there is an edge from vs to vd, and asd = 0, otherwise. Note that A is an asymmetric matrix, because hyperlinks are directed. Most machine learning algorithms assume a feature-vector representation of instances. For web page classification, however, the link graph does not readily give such a vector representation for web pages. If one directly uses each row or column of A for the job, she will suffer a very high computational cost because the dimensionality equals to the number of web pages. On the other hand, it will produces a poor classification accuracy (see our experiments in Section 5), because A is extremely sparse1 . The idea of link matrix factorization is to derive a high-quality feature representation Z of web pages based on analyzing the link matrix A, where Z is an n × l matrix, with each row being the ldimensional feature vector of a web page. The new representation of web pages captures the principal factors of the link structure and makes further processing more efficient. One may use a method similar to LSI, to apply the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) for deriving Z from A. The corresponding optimization problem 2 is min Z,U A − ZU 2 F + γ U 2 F (1) where γ is a small positive number, U is an l ×n matrix, and · F is the Frobenius norm. The optimization aims to approximate A by ZU , a product of two low-rank matrices, with a regularization on U. In the end, the i-th row vector of Z can be thought as the hub feature vector of vertex vi, and the row vector of U can be thought as the authority features. A link generation model proposed in [2] is similar to the PCA approach. Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20]. 1 Due to the sparsity of A, links from two similar pages may not share any common target pages, which makes them to appear dissimilar. However the two pages may be indirectly linked to many common pages via their neighbors. 2 Another equivalent form is minZ,U A − ZU 2 F , s. t. U U = I. The solution Z is identical subject to a scaling factor. However, despite its popularity in matrix analysis, PCA (or other similar methods like PLSA) is restrictive for link matrix factorization. The major problem is that, PCA ignores the fact that the rows and columns of A are indexed by exactly the same set of objects (i.e., web pages). The approximating matrix ˜A = ZU shows no evidence that links are within the same set of objects. To see the drawback, lets consider a link transitivity situation vi → vs → vj, where page i is linked to page s which itself is linked to page j. Since ˜A = ZU treats A as links from web pages {vi} to a different set of objects, let it be denoted by {oi}, ˜A = ZU actually splits an linked object os from vs and breaks down the link path into two parts vi → os and vs → oj. This is obviously a miss interpretation to the original link path. To overcome the problem of PCA, in this paper we suggest to use a different factorization: min Z,U A − ZUZ 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) where U is an l × l full matrix. Note that U is not symmetric, thus ZUZ produces an asymmetric matrix, which is the case of A. Again, each row vector of Z corresponds to a feature vector of a web pages. The new approximating form ˜A = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects, represented by features Z. The factor model actually maps each vertex, vi, into a vector zi = {zi,k; 1 ≤ k ≤ l} in the Rl space. We call the Rl space the factor space. Then, {zi} encodes the information of incoming and outgoing connectivity of vertices {vi}. The factor loadings, U, explain how these observed connections happened based on {zi}. Once we have the vector zi, we can use many traditional classification methods (such as SVMs) or clustering tools (such as K-Means) to perform the analysis. Illustration Based on a Synthetic Problem To further illustrate the advantages of the proposed link matrix factorization Eq. (2), let us consider the graph in Figure 1. Given v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 2: Summarize Figure 1 with a factor graph these observations, we can summarize the graph by grouping as factor graph depicted in Figure 2. In the next we preform the two factorization methods Eq. (2) and Eq. (1) on this link matrix. A good low-rank representation should reveal the structure of the factor graph. First we try PCA-like decomposition, solving Eq. (1) and obtaining Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 1. 0 0 0 0 0 −.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6 −.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 0 .7 .7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 0 0 −0.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6 −.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 We can see that the row vectors of v6 and v7 are the same in Z, indicating that v6 and v7 have the same hub attributes. The row vectors of v2 and v3 are the same in U, indicating that v2 and v3 have the same authority attributes. It is not clear to see the similarity between v4 and v5, because their inlinks (and outlinks) are different. Then, we factorize A by ZUZ via solving Eq. (2), and obtain the results Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.8 −.5 .3 −.1 −.0 −.0 .4 .6 −.1 −.4 −.0 .4 .6 −.1 −.4 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 −.4 .5 .0 −.2 .6 −.4 .5 .0 −.2 .6 −.1 .1 −.4 −.8 −.4 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.1 −.2 −.4 .6 .7 .2 −.5 −.5 −.5 .0 .1 .1 .4 −.4 .3 .1 −.2 −.0 .3 −.1 −.3 .3 −.5 −.4 −.2 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 The resultant Z is very consistent with the clustering structure of vertices: the row vectors of v2 and v3 are the same, those of v4 and v5 are the same, those of v6 and v7 are the same. Even interestingly, if we add constraints to ensure Z and U be nonnegative, we have Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 1. 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 which clearly tells the assignment of vertices to clusters from Z and the links of factor graph from U. When the interpretability is not critical in some tasks, for example, classification, we found that it achieves better accuracies without the nonnegative constraints. Given our above analysis, it is clear that the factorization ZUZ is more expressive than ZU in representing the link matrix A. 3.2 Content Matrix Factorization Now let us consider the content information on the vertices. To combine the link information and content information, we want to use the same latent space to approximate the content as the latent space for the links. Using the bag-of-words approach, we denote the content of web pages by an n×m matrix C, each of whose rows represents a document, each column represents a keyword, where m is the number of keywords. Like the latent semantic indexing (LSI) [8], the l-dimensional latent space for words is denoted by an m × l matrix V . Therefore, we use ZV to approximate matrix C, min V,Z C − ZV 2 F + β V 2 F , (3) where β is a small positive number, β V 2 F serves as a regularization term to improve the robustness. 3.3 Joint Link-Content Matrix Factorization There are many ways to employ both the content and link information for web page classification. Our idea in this paper is not to simply combine them, but rather to fuse them into a single, consistent, and compact feature representation. To achieve this goal, we solve the following problem, min U,V,Z n J (U, V, Z) def = A − ZUZ 2 F + α C − ZV 2 F + γ U 2 F + β V 2 F o . (4) Eq. (4) is the joined matrix factorization of A and C with regularization. The new representation Z is ensured to capture both the structures of the link matrix A and the content matrix C. Once we find the optimal Z, we can apply the traditional classification or clustering methods on vectorial data Z. The relationship among these matrices can be depicted as Figure 3. A Y C U Z V Figure 3: Relationship among the matrices. Node Y is the target of classification. Eq. (4) can be solved using gradient methods, such as the conjugate gradient method and quasi-Newton methods. Then main computation of gradient methods is evaluating the object function J and its gradients against variables, ∂J ∂U = Z ZUZ Z − Z AZ + γU, ∂J ∂V =α V Z Z − C Z + βV, ∂J ∂Z = ZU Z ZU + ZUZ ZU − A ZU − AZU + α ZV V − CV . Because of the sparsity of A, the computational complexity of multiplication of A and Z is O(µAl), where µA is the number of nonzero entries in A. Similarly, the computational complexity of C Z and CV is O(µC l), where µC is the number of nonzero entries in C. The computational complexity of the rest multiplications in the gradient computation is O(nl2 ). Therefore, the total computational complexity in one iteration is O(µAl + µC l + nl2 ). The number of links and the number of words in a web page are relatively small comparing to the number of web pages, and are almost constant as the number of web pages/documents increases, i.e. µA = O(n) and µC = O(n). Therefore, theoretically the computation time is almost linear to the number of web pages/documents, n. 4. SUPERVISED MATRIX FACTORIZATION Consider a web page classification problem. We can solve Eq. (4) to obtain Z as Section 3, then use a traditional classifier to perform classification. However, this approach does not take data labels into account in the first step. Believing that using data labels improves the accuracy by obtaining a better Z for the classification, we consider to use the data labels to guide the matrix factorization, called supervised matrix factorization [22]. Because some data used in the matrix factorization have no label information, the supervised matrix factorization falls into the category of semi-supervised learning. Let C be the set of classes. For simplicity, we first consider binary class problem, i.e. C = {−1, 1}. Assume we know the labels {yi} for vertices in T ⊂ V. We want to find a hypothesis h : V → R, such that we assign vi to 1 when h(vi) ≥ 0, −1 otherwise. We assume a transform from the latent space to R is linear, i.e. h(vi) = w φ(vi) + b = w zi + b, (5) School course dept. faculty other project staff student total Cornell 44 1 34 581 18 21 128 827 Texas 36 1 46 561 20 2 148 814 Washington 77 1 30 907 18 10 123 1166 Wisconsin 85 0 38 894 25 12 156 1210 Table 1: Dataset of WebKB where w and b are parameters to estimate. Here, w is the norm of the decision boundary. Similar to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [7], we can use the hinge loss to measure the loss, X i:vi∈T [1 − yih(vi)]+ , where [x]+ is x if x ≥ 0, 0 if x < 0. However, the hinge loss is not smooth at the hinge point, which makes it difficult to apply gradient methods on the problem. To overcome the difficulty, we use a smoothed version of hinge loss for each data point, g(yih(vi)), (6) where g(x) = 8 >< >: 0 when x ≥ 2, 1 − x when x ≤ 0, 1 4 (x − 2)2 when 0 < x < 2. We reduce a multiclass problem into multiple binary ones. One simple scheme of reduction is the one-against-rest coding scheme. In the one-against-rest scheme, we assign a label vector for each class label. The element of a label vector is 1 if the data point belongs the corresponding class, −1, if the data point does not belong the corresponding class, 0, if the data point is not labeled. Let Y be the label matrix, each column of which is a label vector. Therefore, Y is a matrix of n × c, where c is the number of classes, |C|. Then the values of Eq. (5) form a matrix H = ZW + 1b , (7) where 1 is a vector of size n, whose elements are all one, W is a c × l parameter matrix, and b is a parameter vector of size c. The total loss is proportional to the sum of Eq. (6) over all labeled data points and the classes, LY (W, b, Z) = λ X i:vi∈T ,j∈C g(YijHij), where λ is the parameter to scale the term. To derive a robust solution, we also use Tikhonov regularization for W, ΩW (W) = ν 2 W 2 F , where ν is the parameter to scale the term. Then the supervised matrix factorization problem becomes min U,V,Z,W,b Js(U, V, Z, W, b) (8) where Js(U, V, Z, W, b) = J (U, V, Z) + LY (W, b, Z) + ΩW (W). We can also use gradient methods to solve the problem of Eq. (8). The gradients are ∂Js ∂U = ∂J ∂U , ∂Js ∂V = ∂J ∂V , ∂Js ∂Z = ∂J ∂Z + λGW, ∂Js ∂W =λG Z + νW, ∂Js ∂b =λG 1, where G is an n×c matrix, whose ik-th element is Yikg (YikHik), and g (x) = 8 >< >: 0 when x ≥ 2, −1 when x ≤ 0, 1 2 (x − 2) when 0 < x < 2. Once we obtain w, b, and Z, we can apply h on the vertices with unknown class labels, or apply traditional classification algorithms on Z to get the classification results. 5. EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Data Description In this section, we perform classification on two datasets, to demonstrate the our approach. The two datasets are the WebKB data set[1] and the Cora data set [15]. The WebKB data set consists of about 6000 web pages from computer science departments of four schools (Cornell, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin). The web pages are classified into seven categories. The numbers of pages in each category are shown in Table 1. The Cora data set consists of the abstracts and references of about 34,000 computer science research papers. We use part of them to categorize into one of subfields of data structure (DS), hardware and architecture (HA), machine learning (ML), and programing language (PL). We remove those articles without reference to other articles in the set. The number of papers and the number of subfields in each area are shown in Table 2. area # of papers # of subfields Data structure (DS) 751 9 Hardware and architecture (HA) 400 7 Machine learning (ML) 1617 7 Programing language (PL) 1575 9 Table 2: Dataset of Cora 5.2 Methods The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.

The features are the bag-ofwords and all word are stemmed. This method ignores link structure in the data. Linear SVM is used. The regularization parameter of SVM is selected using the cross-validation method. The implementation of SVM used in the experiments is libSVM[4]. • SVM on links We treat links as the features of each document, i.e. the i-th feature is link-to-pagei. We apply SVM on link features. This method uses link information, but not the link structure. • SVM on link-content We combine the features of the above two methods. We use different weights for these two set of features. The weights are also selected using crossvalidation. • Directed graph regularization This method is described in [25] and [24]. This method is solely based on link structure. • PLSI+PHITS This method is described in [6]. This method combines text content information and link structure for analysis. The PHITS algorithm is in spirit similar to Eq.1, with an additional nonnegative constraint. It models the outgoing and in-coming structures separately. • Link-content MF This is our approach of matrix factorization described in Section 3. We use 50 latent factors for Z. After we compute Z, we train a linear SVM using Z as the feature vectors, then apply SVM on testing portion of Z to obtain the final result, because of the multiclass output. • Link-content sup. MF This method is our approach of the supervised matrix factorization in Section 4. We use 50 latent factors for Z. After we compute Z, we train a linear SVM on the training portion of Z, then apply SVM on testing portion of Z to obtain the final result, because of the multiclass output. We randomly split data into five folds and repeat the experiment for five times, for each time we use one fold for test, four other folds for training. During the training process, we use the crossvalidation to select all model parameters. We measure the results by the classification accuracy, i.e., the percentage of the number of correct classified documents in the entire data set. The results are shown as the average classification accuracies and it standard deviation over the five repeats. 5.3 Results The average classification accuracies for the WebKB data set are shown in Table 3. For this task, the accuracies of SVM on links are worse than that of SVM on content. But the directed graph regularization, which is also based on link alone, achieves a much higher accuracy. This implies that the link structure plays an important role in the classification of this dataset, but individual links in a web page give little information. The combination of link and content using SVM achieves similar accuracy as that of SVM on content alone, which confirms individual links in a web page give little information. Since our approach consider the link structure as well as the content information, our two methods give results a highest accuracies among these approaches. The difference between the results of our two methods is not significant. However in the experiments below, we show the difference between them. The classification accuracies for the Cora data set are shown in Table 4. In this experiment, the accuracies of SVM on the combination of links and content are higher than either SVM on content or SVM on links. This indicates both content and links are infor45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 PLMLHADS accuracy(%) dataset SVM on content SVM on link SVM on link-content Directed graph reg.

The method of directed graph regularization does not perform as good as SVM on link-content, which confirms the importance of the article content in this task. Though our method of link-content matrix factorization perform slightly better than other methods, our method of linkcontent supervised matrix factorization outperform significantly. 5.4 The Number of Factors As we discussed in Section 3, the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors. We perform experiments to study how the number of factors affects the accuracy of predication. We use different numbers of factors for the Cornell data of WebKB data set and the machine learning (ML) data of Cora data set. The result shown in Figure 4(a) and 4(b).

MF link-content MF (b) ML data Figure 4: Accuracy vs number of factors increases as the number of factors increases. It is a different concept from choosing the optimal number of clusters in clustering application. It is how much information to represent in the latent variables. We have considered the regularization over the factors, which avoids the overfit problem for a large number of factors. To choose of the number of factors, we need to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time, which is quadratic to the number of factors. The difference between the method of matrix factorization and that of supervised one decreases as the number of factors increases. This indicates that the usefulness of supervised matrix factorization at lower number of factors. 6. DISCUSSIONS The loss functions LA in Eq. (2) and LC in Eq. (3) use squared loss due to computationally convenience. Actually, squared loss does not precisely describe the underlying noise model, because the weights of adjacency matrix can only take nonnegative values, in our case, zero or one only, and the components of content matrix C can only take nonnegative integers. Therefore, we can apply other types of loss, such as hinge loss or smoothed hinge loss, e.g. LA(U, Z) = µh(A, ZUZ ), where h(A, B) =P i,j [1 − AijBij]+ . In our paper, we mainly discuss the application of classification. A entry of matrix Z means the relationship of a web page and a factor. The values of the entries are the weights of linear model, instead of the probabilities of web pages belonging to latent topics. Therefore, we allow the components take any possible real values. When we come to the clustering application, we can use this model to find Z, then apply K-means to partition the web pages into clusters. Actually, we can use the idea of nonnegative matrix factorization for clustering [20] to directly cluster web pages. As the example with nonnegative constraints shown in Section 3, we represent each cluster by a latent topic, i.e. the dimensionality of the latent space is set to the number of clusters we want. Then the problem of Eq. (4) becomes min U,V,Z J (U, V, Z), s.t.Z ≥ 0. (9) Solving Eq. (9), we can obtain more interpretable results, which could be used for clustering. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we study the problem of how to combine the information of content and links for web page analysis, mainly on classification application. We propose a simple approach using factors to model the text content and link structure of web pages/documents. The directed links are generated from the linear combination of linkage of between source and destination factors. By sharing factors between text content and link structure, it is easy to combine both the content information and link structure. Our experiments show our approach is effective for classification. We also discuss an extension for clustering application. Acknowledgment We would like to thank Dr. Dengyong Zhou for sharing his code of his algorithm.

    "original_translation": "Combinación de contenido y enlace para la clasificación utilizando la factorización de matriz Shenghuo Zhu Kai Yu Yun Chi Yihong Gong {Zsh, Kyu, Ychi, Ygong}@sv.nec-labs.com NEC Laboratories America, Inc. 10080 North Wolfe Road SW3-350 Cupertino, CA CA95014, EE. UU. Resumen La World Wide Web contiene contenidos textuales ricos que están interconectados a través de hipervínculos complejos. Esta enorme base de datos viola la suposición de la mayoría de los métodos estadísticos convencionales que cada página web se considera una muestra independiente e idéntica. Por lo tanto, es difícil aplicar métodos tradicionales de minería o aprendizaje para resolver problemas de minería web, por ejemplo, clasificación de la página web, explotando tanto el contenido como la estructura del enlace. La investigación en esta dirección ha recibido recientemente una atención considerable, pero todavía está en una etapa temprana. Aunque algunos métodos explotan tanto la estructura del enlace como la información de contenido, algunos de ellos combinan la única información de autoridad con la información de contenido, y los otros primero descomponen la estructura del enlace en características de HUB y autoridad, luego aplicanlos como características adicionales de documentos. Siendo prácticamente atractivo para su gran simplicidad, este documento tiene como objetivo diseñar un algoritmo que explote tanto la información de contenido como de enlace, realizando una factorización conjunta tanto en la matriz de adyacencia de enlace como en la matriz a plazo de documentos, y deriva una nueva representación para la webPáginas en un espacio de factores de baja dimensión, sin separarlas explícitamente como contenido, centro o factores de autoridad. Se puede realizar un análisis adicional en función de la representación compacta de las páginas web. En los experimentos, el método propuesto se compara con los métodos de última generación y demuestra una excelente precisión en la clasificación de hipertexto en los puntos de referencia WebKB y Cora. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos: H.3.3 [Sistemas de información]: Búsqueda y recuperación de información Términos generales: Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. Introducción Con el avance de la World Wide Web, cada vez más documentos de hipertexto están disponibles en la web. Algunos ejemplos de dichos datos incluyen páginas web organizacionales y personales (por ejemplo, el conjunto de datos de referencia de WebKB, que contiene páginas web de la universidad), trabajos de investigación (por ejemplo, datos en CitaSeer), artículos de noticias en línea y medios generados por clientes (por ejemplo, blogs). En comparación con los datos en la gestión de la información tradicional, además del contenido, estos datos en la web también contienen enlaces: por ejemplo, hipervínculos de una página de inicio de los estudiantes que señalan la página de inicio de su asesor, citas en papel, fuentes de un artículo de noticias, comentarios de un bloggeren publicaciones de otro blogger, y así sucesivamente. Realizar tareas de gestión de información sobre dichos datos estructurados plantea muchos desafíos de investigación nuevos. En la siguiente discusión, utilizamos la tarea de la clasificación de la página web como un ejemplo de ilustración, mientras que las técnicas que desarrollamos en secciones posteriores son aplicables igualmente bien a muchas otras tareas en la recuperación de información y la minería de datos. Para el problema de clasificación de las páginas web, un enfoque simple es tratar las páginas web como documentos independientes. La ventaja de este enfoque es que muchas herramientas de clasificación estándar se pueden aplicar directamente al problema. Sin embargo, este enfoque se basa solo en el contenido de las páginas web e ignora la estructura de los enlaces entre ellos. Las estructuras de enlace proporcionan información invaluable sobre las propiedades de los documentos, así como las relaciones entre ellos. Por ejemplo, en el conjunto de datos WebKB, la estructura de enlaces proporciona información adicional sobre la relación entre documentos (por ejemplo, enlaces que a menudo apuntan de un estudiante a su asesor o de un miembro de la facultad a sus proyectos). Dado que algunos enlaces entre estos documentos implican la interdependencia entre los documentos, el habitual I.I.D.(Distribuido independiente e idéntico) La suposición de documentos ya no se mantiene más. Desde este punto de vista, los métodos de clasificación tradicionales que ignoran la estructura del enlace pueden no ser adecuados. Por otro lado, algunos estudios, por ejemplo [25], dependen únicamente de las estructuras de enlace. Sin embargo, es un caso muy raro que la información de contenido puede ser ignorable. Por ejemplo, en el conjunto de datos CORA, el contenido de un resumen del artículo de investigación determina en gran medida la categoría del artículo. Para mejorar el rendimiento de la clasificación de la página web, por lo tanto, se debe tener en cuenta tanto la estructura del enlace como la información del contenido. Para lograr este objetivo, un enfoque simple es convertir un tipo de información al otro. Por ejemplo, en la clasificación de blogs spam, Kolari et al.[13] Concatenate Outlink características con las características de contenido del blog. En la clasificación de documentos, Kurland y Lee [14] convierten la similitud de contenido entre documentos en pesos de enlaces. Sin embargo, la información del enlace y el contenido tienen diferentes propiedades. Por ejemplo, un enlace es una evidencia real que representa una relación asimétrica, mientras que la similitud de contenido generalmente se define conceptualmente para cada par de documentos de manera simétrica. Por lo tanto, convertir directamente un tipo de información en el otro generalmente degrada la calidad de la información. Por otro lado, existen algunos estudios, como discutiremos en detalle en el trabajo relacionado, que consideren la información del enlace y la información de contenido por separado y luego los combinen. Argumentamos que este enfoque ignora la consistencia inherente entre el enlace y la información de contenido y, por lo tanto, no combina los dos sin problemas. Algunos trabajan, como [3], incorpora información de enlaces utilizando la similitud de cocitación, pero esto puede no capturar completamente la estructura del enlace global. En la Figura 1, por ejemplo, las páginas web V6 y V7 CO-Cite Web Página V8, lo que implica que V6 y V7 son similares entre sí. En los turnos, V4 y V5 deben ser similares entre sí, ya que V4 y V5 citan páginas web similares V6 y V7, respectivamente. Pero utilizando la similitud de cocitación, la similitud entre V4 y V5 es cero sin considerar otra información.V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 Figura 1: Un ejemplo de estructura de enlace En este documento, proponemos una técnica simple para analizar documentos interconectados, como las páginas web, utilizando el análisis factorial [18]. En la técnica propuesta, tanto la información de contenido como las estructuras de enlaces se combinan perfectamente a través de un solo conjunto de factores latentes. Nuestro modelo contiene dos componentes. El primer componente captura la información de contenido. Este componente tiene una forma similar a la de los temas latentes en la indexación semántica latente (LSI) [8] en la recuperación de información tradicional. Es decir, los documentos se descomponen en temas/factores latentes, que a su vez se representan como vectores de término. El segundo componente captura la información contenida en la estructura de enlace subyacente, como los enlaces de las páginas de inicio de los estudiantes a los de los miembros de la facultad. Un factor puede considerarse libremente como un tipo de documentos (por ejemplo, esas páginas de inicio que pertenecen a los estudiantes). Vale la pena señalar que no definimos explícitamente el semántico de un factor a priori. En cambio, similar a LSI, los factores se aprenden de los datos. El análisis factorial tradicional modela las variables asociadas con las entidades a través de los factores. Sin embargo, en el análisis de las estructuras de enlace, necesitamos modelar la relación de dos extremos de los enlaces, es decir, los bordes entre los pares de vértices. Por lo tanto, el modelo debe involucrar factores de ambos vértices del borde. Esta es una diferencia clave entre el análisis factorial tradicional y nuestro modelo. En nuestro modelo, conectamos dos componentes a través de un conjunto de factores compartidos, es decir, los factores latentes en el segundo componente (para contenido) están vinculados a los factores en el primer componente (para enlaces). Al hacer esto, buscamos un conjunto unificado de factores latentes que mejor explique las estructuras de contenido y enlace simultáneamente y sin problemas. En la formulación, realizamos un análisis factorial basado en la factorización de la matriz: la solución al primer componente se basa en factorizar la matriz de documento de término derivada de las características de contenido;La solución al segundo componente se basa en factorizar la matriz de adyacencia derivada de los enlaces. Debido a que las dos factores comparten una base común, las bases descubiertas (factores latentes) explican tanto la información del contenido como las estructuras de enlaces, y luego se utilizan en tareas de gestión de información más como la clasificación. Este artículo está organizado de la siguiente forma: La Sección 2 revisa el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 3 presenta el enfoque propuesto para analizar la página web en función de la información combinada de enlaces y contenido. La Sección 4 extiende el marco básico y algunas variantes para la melodía. La Sección 5 muestra los resultados del experimento. La Sección 6 analiza los detalles de este enfoque y la Sección 7 concluye.2. Trabajo relacionado En la parte de análisis de contenido, nuestro enfoque está estrechamente relacionado con la indexación semántica latente (LSI) [8]. LSI mapea los documentos en un espacio latente dimensional inferior. El espacio latente captura implícitamente una gran parte de la información de los documentos, por lo tanto, se llama espacio semántico latente. La similitud entre los documentos podría definirse mediante los productos DOT de los vectores correspondientes de documentos en el espacio latente. Las tareas de análisis, como la clasificación, podrían realizarse en el espacio latente. El método de descomposición del valor singular (SVD) comúnmente utilizado garantiza que los puntos de datos en el espacio latente puedan reconstruir de manera óptima los documentos originales. Aunque nuestro enfoque también usa espacio latente para representar páginas web (documentos), consideramos la estructura de enlaces y el contenido de las páginas web. En el enfoque de análisis de enlaces, el marco de centros y autoridades (hits) [12] pone la página web en dos categorías, centros y autoridades. Utilizando la noción recursiva, un centro es una página web con muchos enlaces salientes a las autoridades, mientras que una autoridad es una página web con muchos enlaces entrantes de los centros. En lugar de usar dos categorías, PageRank [17] usa una sola categoría para la noción recursiva, una autoridad es una página web con muchos enlaces entrantes de las autoridades. Él et al.[9] proponer un algoritmo de agrupación para la agrupación de documentos web. El algoritmo incorpora la estructura del enlace y los patrones de co-citación. En el algoritmo, todos los enlaces se tratan como el borde no dirigido del gráfico de enlace. La información de contenido solo se usa para sopesar los enlaces por la similitud textual de ambos extremos de los enlaces. Zhang et al.[23] utiliza el marco de regularización de gráficos no dirigido para la clasificación de documentos. Achlioptas et al [2] descomponen la web en los atributos de Hub y Autoridad y luego los combina con contenido. Zhou et al.[25] y [24] proponen un marco de regularización de gráficos dirigido para el aprendizaje semi-supervisado. El marco combina la información del centro y la autoridad de las páginas web. Pero es difícil combinar la información de contenido en ese marco. Nuestro enfoque considere el contenido y el enlace dirigido entre los temas de las páginas web de origen y destino en un solo paso, lo que implica que el tema combina la información de la página web como autoridades y como centros en un solo conjunto de factores. Cohn y Hofmann [6] construyen el espacio latente a partir de la información de contenido y enlace, utilizando análisis de contenido basado en LSI probabilístico (PLSI) [10] y análisis de enlaces basados en PHIT [5]. La principal diferencia entre el enfoque de [6] (PLSI+PHIT) y nuestro enfoque es por parte del análisis de enlaces. En PLSI+PHIT, el enlace se construye con el enlace desde el tema de la página web de origen a la página web de destino. En el modelo, los enlaces salientes de la página web de destino no tienen ningún efecto en la página web de origen. En otras palabras, la estructura de enlace general no se utiliza en PHIT. En nuestro enfoque, el enlace se construye con el enlace entre el factor de la página web de origen y el factor de la página web de destino, en lugar de la página web de destino. El factor de la página web de destino contiene información de sus enlaces salientes. A su vez, dicha información se pasa al factor de la página web de origen. Como resultado de la factorización de la matriz, el factor forma un gráfico de factor, una miniatura del gráfico original, preservando la estructura principal del gráfico original. Taskar et al.[19] propone redes relacionales de Markov (RMN) para la clasificación de entidades, describiendo una distribución condicional de las clases de entidad dadas los atributos y las relaciones de la entidad. El modelo se aplicó a la clasificación de la página web, donde las páginas web son entidades y los hipervínculos se tratan como relaciones. Los RMN aplican campos aleatorios condicionales para definir un conjunto de funciones potenciales en camarillas de variables aleatorias, donde la estructura de enlace proporciona sugerencias para formar las camarillas. Sin embargo, el modelo no ofrece una solución estándar, porque el éxito depende en gran medida de las artes de diseñar las funciones potenciales. Por otro lado, la inferencia por RMN es intratable y requiere propagación de creencias. Los siguientes son algunos trabajos para combinar documentos y enlaces, pero los métodos están relacionado libremente con nuestro enfoque. Los experimentos de [21] muestran que el uso de términos del documento vinculado mejora la precisión de la clasificación. Chakrabarti et al.[3] Use información de co-citación en su modelo de clasificación. Joachims et al.[11] Combine los núcleos de texto y los núcleos de co-citación para la clasificación. Oh et al [16] usan el marco bayesiano ingenuo para combinar la información de enlace con el contenido.3. Nuestro enfoque en esta sección primero introduciremos un nuevo método de factorización de matriz, que es más adecuado que los métodos de factorización de matriz convencionales para el análisis de enlaces. Luego presentaremos nuestro enfoque que factoriza conjuntamente la matriz de documento a plazo y la matriz de enlace y obtiene factores compactos y altamente indicativos para representar documentos o páginas web.3.1 Factorización de la matriz de enlace Suponga que tenemos un gráfico dirigido g = (v, e), donde el vértice establece v = {vi} n i = 1 representa las páginas web y el conjunto de borde E representa los hipervínculos entre páginas web. Sea A = {ASD} denota la matriz de adyacencia N × N de G, que también se llama matriz de enlaces en este documento. Para un par de vértices, VS y VD, deje que ASD = 1 cuando haya un borde de VS a VD, y ASD = 0, de lo contrario. Tenga en cuenta que A es una matriz asimétrica, porque se dirigen los hipervínculos. La mayoría de los algoritmos de aprendizaje automático asumen una representación de vectores de características de las instancias. Sin embargo, para la clasificación de la página web, el gráfico de enlaces no proporciona fácilmente dicha representación vectorial para páginas web. Si uno usa directamente cada fila o columna de A para el trabajo, sufrirá un costo computacional muy alto porque la dimensionalidad es igual a la cantidad de páginas web. Por otro lado, producirá una precisión de clasificación deficiente (ver nuestros experimentos en la Sección 5), porque A es extremadamente escaso1. La idea de la factorización de la matriz de enlaces es derivar una representación de características de alta calidad Z de páginas web basadas en el análisis de la matriz de enlace A, donde Z es una matriz N × L, siendo cada fila el vector de características ldimensionales de una página web. La nueva representación de las páginas web captura los factores principales de la estructura del enlace y hace que el procesamiento adicional sea más eficiente. Uno puede usar un método similar a LSI, para aplicar el conocido análisis de componentes principales (PCA) para derivar Z de A. El problema de optimización correspondiente 2 es Min Z, U A - Zu 2 F + γ U 2 F (1) donde γ es un pequeño número positivo, U es una matriz L × N y · F es la norma Frobenius. La optimización tiene como objetivo aproximar A por Zu, un producto de dos matrices de bajo rango, con una regularización en U. Al final, el vector de la fila I-Th of Z puede considerarse como el vector de características del cubo de Vertex VI, y el vector de fila de U puede considerarse como la autoridad presenta. Un modelo de generación de enlaces propuesto en [2] es similar al enfoque PCA. Dado que A es una matriz no negativa aquí, también se puede considerar poner restricciones no negativas en U y Z, que produce un algoritmo similar al PLSA [10] y NMF [20].1 Debido a la escasez de A, los enlaces de dos páginas similares pueden no compartir ninguna página objetivo común, lo que hace que parezcan diferentes. Sin embargo, las dos páginas pueden estar indirectamente vinculadas a muchas páginas comunes a través de sus vecinos.2 Otra forma equivalente es Minz, U A - Zu 2 F, s.t.U u = I. La solución z está sujeta idéntica a un factor de escala. Sin embargo, a pesar de su popularidad en el análisis de matriz, PCA (u otros métodos similares como PLSA) es restrictivo para la factorización de la matriz de enlace. El principal problema es que PCA ignora el hecho de que las filas y las columnas de A están indexadas exactamente por el mismo conjunto de objetos (es decir, páginas web). La matriz aproximada ˜a = zu no muestra evidencia de que los enlaces estén dentro del mismo conjunto de objetos. Para ver el inconveniente, consideremos una situación de transitividad de enlace VI → VS → VJ, donde la página I está vinculada a la página S que está vinculada a la página j. Dado que ˜a = zu trata A como enlaces desde las páginas web {vi} a un conjunto diferente de objetos, que se denote por {oi}, ˜a = zu realmente divide un sistema operativo de objetos vinculado de VS y descompone la ruta del enlace haciaDos partes VI → OS y VS → OJ. Obviamente, esto es una interpretación de Miss en la ruta del enlace original. Para superar el problema de PCA, en este documento sugerimos usar una factorización diferente: Min Z, U A - Zuz 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) donde U es una matriz completa L × L. Tenga en cuenta que U no es simétrico, por lo tanto, Zuz produce una matriz asimétrica, que es el caso de A. Nuevamente, cada vector de fila de z corresponde a un vector de características de páginas web. La nueva forma de aproximación ˜A = ZUZ pone un claro significado de que los enlaces están entre el mismo conjunto de objetos, representados por las características Z. El modelo de factor en realidad mapea cada vértice, vi, en un vector zi = {zi, k;1 ≤ k ≤ l} en el espacio RL. Llamamos al espacio RL el espacio del factor. Luego, {Zi} codifica la información de conectividad entrante y saliente de los vértices {vi}. Las cargas de factores, U, explican cómo se produjeron estas conexiones observadas en función de {Zi}. Una vez que tenemos el vector Zi, podemos usar muchos métodos de clasificación tradicionales (como SVM) o herramientas de agrupación (como K-means) para realizar el análisis. Ilustración basada en un problema sintético para ilustrar aún más las ventajas de la factorización de matriz de enlace propuesta Eq.(2), consideremos el gráfico en la Figura 1. Dado V1 V1 V3 V3 V5 V6 V6 V7 V8 Figura 2: Resumir la Figura 1 con un gráfico de factor estas observaciones, podemos resumir el gráfico agrupando como gráfico de factor representado en la Figura 2. En el siguiente realizamos los dos métodos de factorización Eq.(2) y la ecuación.(1) En esta matriz de enlace. Una buena representación de bajo rango debe revelar la estructura del gráfico de factores. Primero probamos la descomposición similar a PCA, resolviendo la ecuación.(1) y obteniendo z = u = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 1. 0 0 0 0 0 0 −.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6−.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 .7 .7 .7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 77 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 0 0 0−0.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6 −.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 77 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 Podemos ver que los vectores de fila de V6 y V7 son los mismos en z, lo que indica que V6 y V7 tienen los mismos atributos de cubo. Los vectores de fila de V2 y V3 son los mismos en U, lo que indica que V2 y V3 tienen los mismos atributos de autoridad. No está claro ver la similitud entre V4 y V5, porque sus incendios (y los ataques) son diferentes. Luego, factorizamos A por zuz mediante la resolución de la ecuación.(2), y obtenga los resultados z = u = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.8 −.5 .3 −.1 −.0 −.0 .4.6 −.1 −.4 −.0 .4 .6 −.1 −.4 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 −.4 .5.0 −.2 .6 −.4 .5 .0 −.2 .6 −.1 .1 −.4 −.8 −.4 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 52 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.1 −.2 −.4 .6 .7 .2 −.5 −.5 −.5 .0 .1 .1 .4 −.4 .3 .1 −.2 −.0 .3 −.1 −.3 .3 −.5 −.4 −.2 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 La z resultante es muy consistente con la estructura de agrupación de los vértices: los vectores de filade V2 y V3 son los mismos, los de V4 y V5 son los mismos, los de V6 y V7 son los mismos. Incluso curiosamente, si agregamos restricciones para garantizar que Z y U no sean negativas, tenemos z = u = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 00 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 77 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 77 7 7 5 que claramente indica la asignación de vértices a grupos de Z y los enlaces del gráfico Factor de U. Cuando la interpretabilidad no es crítica en algunas tareas, por ejemplo, la clasificación, encontramos que logra mejores precisiones sin las restricciones no negativas. Dado nuestro análisis anterior, está claro que la factorización Zuz es más expresiva que Zu al representar la matriz de enlace A. 3.2 Factorización de la matriz de contenido Ahora consideremos la información de contenido en los vértices. Para combinar la información del enlace y la información de contenido, queremos usar el mismo espacio latente para aproximar el contenido que el espacio latente para los enlaces. Usando el enfoque de la bolsa de palabras, denotamos el contenido de las páginas web por una matriz C N × M, cada una de cuyas filas representa un documento, cada columna representa una palabra clave, donde M es el número de palabras clave. Al igual que la indexación semántica latente (LSI) [8], el espacio latente L-dimensional para palabras se denota mediante una matriz M × L v. Por lo tanto, usamos ZV para aproximar la matriz C, Min V, Z C - ZV 2 F + β V 2 F, (3) donde β es un pequeño número positivo, β V 2 F sirve como un término de regularización para mejorar la robustez.3.3 Factorización de matriz de contenido de enlace conjunto Hay muchas formas de emplear la información de contenido y enlace para la clasificación de la página web. Nuestra idea en este documento no es simplemente combinarlos, sino más bien fusionarlos en una sola representación de características compacta y compacta. Para lograr este objetivo, resolvemos el siguiente problema, Min U, V, Z N J (U, V, Z) def = A - Zuz 2 F + α C - ZV 2 F + γ U 2 F + β V 2 Fo.(4) Eq.(4) es la factorización de matriz unida de A y C con regularización. La nueva representación z se garantiza para capturar las estructuras de la matriz de enlace A y la matriz de contenido C. Una vez que encontramos la Z óptima, podemos aplicar los métodos de clasificación o agrupación tradicionales en los datos vectoriales Z. La relación entre estas matrices se puede representar como la Figura 3. A Y C U Z V Figura 3: Relación entre las matrices. El nodo Y es el objetivo de clasificación. Ec.(4) se puede resolver utilizando métodos de gradiente, como el método de gradiente conjugado y los métodos cuasi-newton. Entonces el cálculo principal de los métodos de gradiente es evaluar la función del objeto j y sus gradientes contra las variables, ∂j ∂u = z zuz z - z az + γu, ∂j ∂v = α v z - c z + βV, ∂j ∂z = zuZ zu + zuz zu - a zu - azu + α zv v - cv. Debido a la escasez de A, la complejidad computacional de la multiplicación de A y Z es O (µal), donde µA es el número de entradas distintas de cero en A. Del mismo modo, la complejidad computacional de C Z y CV es O (µC L), donde µC es el número de entradas distintas de cero en C. La complejidad computacional de las multiplicaciones REST en el cálculo de gradiente es O (NL2). Por lo tanto, la complejidad computacional total en una iteración es O (µal + µC L + NL2). El número de enlaces y el número de palabras en una página web son relativamente pequeñas en comparación con el número de páginas web, y son casi constantes a medida que aumenta el número de páginas/documentos web, es decir, µA = o (n) y µc = o ((norte). Por lo tanto, teóricamente el tiempo de cálculo es casi lineal para el número de páginas web/documentos, n.4. Factorización de matriz supervisada Considere un problema de clasificación de la página web. Podemos resolver la ecuación.(4) Para obtener Z como Sección 3, luego use un clasificador tradicional para realizar la clasificación. Sin embargo, este enfoque no tiene en cuenta las etiquetas de datos en el primer paso. Creyendo que el uso de etiquetas de datos mejora la precisión al obtener una Z mejor para la clasificación, consideramos usar las etiquetas de datos para guiar la factorización de la matriz, llamada factorización de matriz supervisada [22]. Debido a que algunos datos utilizados en la factorización de la matriz no tienen información de etiqueta, la factorización de matriz supervisada cae en la categoría de aprendizaje semi-supervisado. Sea C el conjunto de clases. Para simplificar, primero consideramos el problema de la clase binaria, es decir, C = {−1, 1}. Suponga que conocemos las etiquetas {yi} para los vértices en T ⊂ V. Queremos encontrar una hipótesis H: V → R, de modo que asignamos vi a 1 cuando h (vi) ≥ 0, −1 de lo contrario. Asumimos que una transformación del espacio latente a R es lineal, es decir, H (VI) = W φ (VI) + B = W Zi + B, (5) Departamento de curso escolar.Facultad Otro Estudiante del Estudiante del Proyecto Total Cornell 44 1 34 581 18 21 128 827 Texas 36 1 46 561 20 2 148 814 Washington 77 1 30 907 18 10 123 1166 Wisconsin 85 0 38 894 25 12 156 1210 Tabla 1: DataSet of WebKB donde Wy B son parámetros para estimar. Aquí, W es la norma del límite de decisión. Similar a las máquinas vectoriales de soporte (SVM) [7], podemos usar la pérdida de bisagra para medir la pérdida, x I: Vi∈T [1 - yih (vi)]+, donde [x]+ es x si x ≥ 0, 0 si x <0. Sin embargo, la pérdida de bisagra no es suave en el punto de bisagra, lo que dificulta la aplicación de métodos de gradiente sobre el problema. Para superar la dificultad, usamos una versión suavizada de la pérdida de bisagra para cada punto de datos, g (yih (vi)), (6) donde g (x) = 8> <>: 0 cuando x ≥ 2, 1 - x cuandox ≤ 0, 1 4 (x - 2) 2 cuando 0 <x <2. Reducimos un problema multiclase en múltiples binarios. Un simple esquema de reducción es el esquema de codificación de un solo descanso. En el esquema de un solo restablecimiento, asignamos un vector de etiqueta para cada etiqueta de clase. El elemento de un vector de etiqueta es 1 si el punto de datos pertenece a la clase correspondiente, −1, si el punto de datos no pertenece a la clase correspondiente, 0, si el punto de datos no está etiquetado. Sea Y la matriz de etiqueta, cada columna de la cual es un vector de etiqueta. Por lo tanto, y es una matriz de N × C, donde C es el número de clases, | C |. Entonces los valores de la ecuación.(5) Formar una matriz H = ZW + 1B, (7) donde 1 es un vector de tamaño N, cuyos elementos son todos uno, W es una matriz de parámetros C × L, y B es un vector de parámetro de tamaño c.La pérdida total es proporcional a la suma de la ecuación.(6) Sobre todos los puntos de datos etiquetados y las clases, ly (w, b, z) = λ x i: vi∈T, j∈C g (yijhij), donde λ es el parámetro para escalar el término. Para obtener una solución robusta, también usamos la regularización de tikhonov para w, ωw (w) = ν 2 w 2 f, donde ν es el parámetro para escalar el término. Luego, el problema de factorización de la matriz supervisada se convierte en Min U, V, Z, W, B JS (U, V, Z, W, B) (8) donde JS (U, V, Z, W, B) = J (U,V, Z) + ly (W, B, Z) + Ωw (W). También podemos usar métodos de gradiente para resolver el problema de la ecuación.(8). Los gradientes son ∂js ∂u = ∂j ∂u, ∂js ∂v = ∂j ∂v, ∂js ∂z = ∂j ∂z + λgw, ∂js ∂w = λg z + νw, ∂js ∂B =λg 1, donde G es una matriz n × C, cuyo elemento ik-th es yikg (yikhik), y g (x) = 8> <>: 0 cuando x ≥ 2, −1 cuando x ≤ 0, 1 2 (x - 2) cuando 0 <x <2. Una vez que obtenemos W, B y Z, podemos aplicar H en los vértices con etiquetas de clase desconocidas, o aplicar algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales en z para obtener los resultados de clasificación.5. Experimentos 5.1 Descripción de los datos En esta sección, realizamos la clasificación en dos conjuntos de datos, para demostrar el enfoque de nuestro enfoque. Los dos conjuntos de datos son el conjunto de datos WebKB [1] y el conjunto de datos CORA [15]. El conjunto de datos WebKB consta de aproximadamente 6000 páginas web de los departamentos de informática de cuatro escuelas (Cornell, Texas, Washington y Wisconsin). Las páginas web se clasifican en siete categorías. Los números de páginas en cada categoría se muestran en la Tabla 1. El conjunto de datos CORA consta de los resúmenes y referencias de aproximadamente 34,000 trabajos de investigación de informática. Utilizamos parte de ellos para clasificar en uno de los subcampos de la estructura de datos (DS), el hardware y la arquitectura (HA), el aprendizaje automático (ML) y el lenguaje de programación (PL). Eliminamos esos artículos sin referencia a otros artículos en el conjunto. El número de documentos y el número de subcampos en cada área se muestran en la Tabla 2.

Las características son las palabras de la bolsa y todas las palabras son vistas. Este método ignora la estructura del enlace en los datos. Se usa SVM lineal. El parámetro de regularización de SVM se selecciona utilizando el método de validación cruzada. La implementación de SVM utilizada en los experimentos es libsvm [4].• SVM en enlaces tratamos los enlaces como las características de cada documento, es decir, la característica I-Th es Link to Pagei. Aplicamos SVM en las funciones de enlace. Este método utiliza información de enlaces, pero no la estructura del enlace.• SVM en el contenido del enlace Combinamos las características de los dos métodos anteriores. Usamos diferentes pesos para estos dos conjuntos de características. Los pesos también se seleccionan mediante validación cruzada.• Regularización de gráficos dirigidos Este método se describe en [25] y [24]. Este método se basa únicamente en la estructura del enlace.• PLSI+Phits Este método se describe en [6]. Este método combina información de contenido de texto y estructura de enlaces para el análisis. El algoritmo PHITS es en un espíritu similar a la ecuación 1, con una restricción no negativa adicional. Modela las estructuras salientes y entrantes por separado.• El contenido de enlace MF Este es nuestro enfoque de la factorización de la matriz descrita en la Sección 3. Usamos 50 factores latentes para Z. Después de calcular la Z, entrenamos un SVM lineal usando Z como vectores de características, luego aplicamos SVM en la parte de prueba de Z para obtener el resultado final, debido a la salida multiclase.• Sup. Link-Content Sup. MF Este método es nuestro enfoque de la factorización de matriz supervisada en la Sección 4. Usamos 50 factores latentes para Z. Después de calcular la Z, entrenamos un SVM lineal en la parte de entrenamiento de Z, luego aplicamos SVM en la parte de prueba de Z para obtener el resultado final, debido a la salida multiclase. Divendemos aleatoriamente los datos en cinco pliegues y repitemos el experimento por cinco veces, por cada vez que usamos un pliegue para la prueba, otros cuatro pliegues para el entrenamiento. Durante el proceso de capacitación, utilizamos la validación cruzada para seleccionar todos los parámetros del modelo. Medimos los resultados por precisión de clasificación, es decir, el porcentaje del número de documentos clasificados correctos en todo el conjunto de datos. Los resultados se muestran como las precisiones de clasificación promedio y la desviación estándar de TI en las cinco repeticiones.5.3 Resultados Las precisiones de clasificación promedio para el conjunto de datos WebKB se muestran en la Tabla 3. Para esta tarea, las precisiones de SVM en los enlaces son peores que las de SVM en el contenido. Pero la regularización del gráfico dirigido, que también se basa solo en el enlace, logra una precisión mucho mayor. Esto implica que la estructura de enlaces juega un papel importante en la clasificación de este conjunto de datos, pero los enlaces individuales en una página web dan poca información. La combinación de enlaces y contenido que usa SVM logra una precisión similar a la de SVM solo en el contenido, lo que confirma que los enlaces individuales en una página web brindan poca información. Dado que nuestro enfoque considere la estructura del enlace y la información del contenido, nuestros dos métodos dan a los resultados una mayor precisión entre estos enfoques. La diferencia entre los resultados de nuestros dos métodos no es significativa. Sin embargo, en los experimentos a continuación, mostramos la diferencia entre ellos. Las precisiones de clasificación para el conjunto de datos CORA se muestran en la Tabla 4. En este experimento, las precisiones de SVM en la combinación de enlaces y contenido son más altas que SVM en contenido o SVM en enlaces. Esto indica que tanto el contenido como los enlaces son infor45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 PLMLHADS Precisión (%) DataSet SVM en Content SVM en el enlace SVM en el contenido de enlace Reg.

El método de regularización de gráficos dirigidos no funciona tan bien como SVM en el contenido de enlace, lo que confirma la importancia del contenido del artículo en esta tarea. Aunque nuestro método de factorización de matriz de contenido de enlace funciona ligeramente mejor que otros métodos, nuestro método de factorización de matriz supervisada de LinkContent superan significativamente.5.4 El número de factores Como discutimos en la Sección 3, la complejidad computacional de cada iteración para resolver el problema de optimización es cuadrático al número de factores. Realizamos experimentos para estudiar cómo el número de factores afecta la precisión de la predicación. Utilizamos diferentes números de factores para los datos de Cornell del conjunto de datos WebKB y los datos de aprendizaje automático (ML) del conjunto de datos CORA. El resultado que se muestra en la Figura 4 (a) y 4 (b). Las cifras muestran que la precisión 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 0 10 20 30 30 40 50 Precisión (%) Número de factores Sup.

Es un concepto diferente de elegir el número óptimo de grupos en la aplicación de agrupación. Es cuánta información representar en las variables latentes. Hemos considerado la regularización sobre los factores, lo que evita el problema de sobre fáctica para una gran cantidad de factores. Para elegir el número de factores, debemos considerar la compensación entre la precisión y el tiempo de cálculo, lo cual es cuadrático para el número de factores. La diferencia entre el método de factorización de la matriz y la supervisada disminuye a medida que aumenta el número de factores. Esto indica que la utilidad de la factorización de la matriz supervisada a un número menor de factores.6. Discusiones Las funciones de pérdida en la ecuación.(2) y LC en la ecuación.(3) Use la pérdida al cuadrado debido a la conveniencia computacional. En realidad, la pérdida al cuadrado no describe con precisión el modelo de ruido subyacente, porque los pesos de la matriz de adyacencia solo pueden tomar valores no negativos, en nuestro caso, cero o uno solo, y los componentes de la matriz de contenido C solo pueden tomar enteros no negativos. Por lo tanto, podemos aplicar otros tipos de pérdida, como pérdida de bisagra o pérdida de bisagra suavizada, p. La (u, z) = µH (a, zuz), donde h (a, b) = p i, j [1 - aijbij]+. En nuestro artículo, discutimos principalmente la aplicación de la clasificación. Una entrada de Matrix Z significa la relación de una página web y un factor. Los valores de las entradas son los pesos del modelo lineal, en lugar de las probabilidades de las páginas web que pertenecen a temas latentes. Por lo tanto, permitimos que los componentes tomen posibles valores reales. Cuando llegamos a la aplicación de agrupación, podemos usar este modelo para encontrar Z, luego aplicar K-Means para dividir las páginas web en grupos. En realidad, podemos usar la idea de factorización de matriz no negativa para la agrupación [20] para agrupar las páginas web directamente. Como el ejemplo con restricciones no negativas que se muestran en la Sección 3, representamos cada grupo por un tema latente, es decir, la dimensionalidad del espacio latente se establece en el número de grupos que queremos. Entonces el problema de la ecuación.(4) se convierte en Min U, V, Z J (U, V, Z), S.T.Z ≥ 0. (9) Resolviendo la ecuación.(9), podemos obtener resultados más interpretables, que podrían usarse para la agrupación.7. Conclusiones En este documento, estudiamos el problema de cómo combinar la información de contenido y enlaces para el análisis de la página web, principalmente en la aplicación de clasificación. Proponemos un enfoque simple utilizando factores para modelar el contenido de texto y la estructura de enlace de las páginas/documentos web. Los enlaces dirigidos se generan a partir de la combinación lineal de vinculación entre los factores de origen y de destino. Al compartir factores entre el contenido de texto y la estructura del enlace, es fácil combinar tanto la información del contenido como la estructura del enlace. Nuestros experimentos muestran que nuestro enfoque es efectivo para la clasificación. También discutimos una extensión para la aplicación de agrupación.

        "Combining Content and Link for Classification using Matrix Factorization Shenghuo Zhu Kai Yu Yun Chi Yihong Gong {zsh,kyu,ychi,ygong}@sv.nec-labs.com NEC Laboratories America, Inc. 10080 North Wolfe Road SW3-350 Cupertino, CA 95014, USA ABSTRACT The world wide web contains rich textual contents that are interconnected via complex hyperlinks.",
        "This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample.",
        "It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure.",
        "The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.",
        "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
        "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
        "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",
        "In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION With the advance of the World Wide Web, more and more hypertext documents become available on the Web.",
        "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
        "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
        "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
        "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
        "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
        "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
        "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
        "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
        "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
        "From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
        "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
        "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
        "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
        "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
        "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
        "For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
        "In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
        "However, link and content information have different properties.",
        "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
        "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
        "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
        "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
        "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
        "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",
        "In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively.",
        "But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18].",
        "In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors.",
        "Our model contains two components.",
        "The first component captures the content information.",
        "This component has a form similar to that of the latent topics in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8] in traditional information retrieval.",
        "That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors.",
        "The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members.",
        "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
        "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",
        "Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.",
        "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",
        "However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the relationship of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs.",
        "Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge.",
        "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
        "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
        "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
        "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
        "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work.",
        "Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content.",
        "Section 4 extends the basic framework and a few variants for fine tune.",
        "Section 5 shows the experiment results.",
        "Section 6 discusses the details of this approach and Section 7 concludes. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8].",
        "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
        "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
        "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
        "Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space.",
        "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
        "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
        "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
        "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
        "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",
        "He et al. [9] propose a clustering algorithm for web document clustering.",
        "The algorithm incorporates link structure and the co-citation patterns.",
        "In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph.",
        "The content information is only used for weighing the links by the textual similarity of both ends of the links.",
        "Zhang et al. [23] uses the undirected graph regularization framework for document classification.",
        "Achlioptas et al[2] decompose the web into hub and authority attributes then combine them with content.",
        "Zhou et al. [25] and [24] propose a directed graph regularization framework for semi-supervised learning.",
        "The framework combines the hub and authority information of web pages.",
        "But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework.",
        "Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors.",
        "Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5].",
        "The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.",
        "In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.",
        "In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page.",
        "In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS.",
        "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
        "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
        "In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page.",
        "As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph.",
        "Taskar et al. [19] propose relational Markov networks (RMNs) for entity classification, by describing a conditional distribution of entity classes given entity attributes and relationships.",
        "The model was applied to web page classification, where web pages are entities and hyperlinks are treated as relationships.",
        "RMNs apply conditional random fields to define a set of potential functions on cliques of random variables, where the link structure provides hints to form the cliques.",
        "However the model does not give an off-the-shelf solution, because the success highly depends on the arts of designing the potential functions.",
        "On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation.",
        "The following are some work on combining documents and links, but the methods are loosely related to our approach.",
        "The experiments of [21] show that using terms from the linked document improves the classification accuracy.",
        "Chakrabarti et al. [3] use co-citation information in their classification model.",
        "Joachims et al. [11] combine text kernels and co-citation kernels for classification.",
        "Oh et al [16] use the Naive Bayesian frame to combine link information with content. 3.",
        "OUR APPROACH In this section we will first introduce a novel matrix factorization method, which is more suitable than conventional matrix factorization methods for link analysis.",
        "Then we will introduce our approach that jointly factorizes the document-term matrix and link matrix and obtains compact and highly indicative factors for representing documents or web pages. 3.1 Link Matrix Factorization Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V, E), where the vertex set V = {vi}n i=1 represents the web pages and the edge set E represents the hyperlinks between web pages.",
        "Let A = {asd} denotes the n×n adjacency matrix of G, which is also called the link matrix in this paper.",
        "For a pair of vertices, vs and vd, let asd = 1 when there is an edge from vs to vd, and asd = 0, otherwise.",
        "Note that A is an asymmetric matrix, because hyperlinks are directed.",
        "Most machine learning algorithms assume a feature-vector representation of instances.",
        "For web page classification, however, the link graph does not readily give such a vector representation for web pages.",
        "If one directly uses each row or column of A for the job, she will suffer a very high computational cost because the dimensionality equals to the number of web pages.",
        "On the other hand, it will produces a poor classification accuracy (see our experiments in Section 5), because A is extremely sparse1 .",
        "The idea of link matrix factorization is to derive a high-quality feature representation Z of web pages based on analyzing the link matrix A, where Z is an n × l matrix, with each row being the ldimensional feature vector of a web page.",
        "The new representation of web pages captures the principal factors of the link structure and makes further processing more efficient.",
        "One may use a method similar to LSI, to apply the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) for deriving Z from A.",
        "The corresponding optimization problem 2 is min Z,U A − ZU 2 F + γ U 2 F (1) where γ is a small positive number, U is an l ×n matrix, and · F is the Frobenius norm.",
        "The optimization aims to approximate A by ZU , a product of two low-rank matrices, with a regularization on U.",
        "In the end, the i-th row vector of Z can be thought as the hub feature vector of vertex vi, and the row vector of U can be thought as the authority features.",
        "A link generation model proposed in [2] is similar to the PCA approach.",
        "Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20]. 1 Due to the sparsity of A, links from two similar pages may not share any common target pages, which makes them to appear dissimilar.",
        "However the two pages may be indirectly linked to many common pages via their neighbors. 2 Another equivalent form is minZ,U A − ZU 2 F , s. t. U U = I.",
        "The solution Z is identical subject to a scaling factor.",
        "However, despite its popularity in matrix analysis, PCA (or other similar methods like PLSA) is restrictive for link matrix factorization.",
        "The major problem is that, PCA ignores the fact that the rows and columns of A are indexed by exactly the same set of objects (i.e., web pages).",
        "The approximating matrix ˜A = ZU shows no evidence that links are within the same set of objects.",
        "To see the drawback, lets consider a link transitivity situation vi → vs → vj, where page i is linked to page s which itself is linked to page j.",
        "Since ˜A = ZU treats A as links from web pages {vi} to a different set of objects, let it be denoted by {oi}, ˜A = ZU actually splits an linked object os from vs and breaks down the link path into two parts vi → os and vs → oj.",
        "This is obviously a miss interpretation to the original link path.",
        "To overcome the problem of PCA, in this paper we suggest to use a different factorization: min Z,U A − ZUZ 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) where U is an l × l full matrix.",
        "Note that U is not symmetric, thus ZUZ produces an asymmetric matrix, which is the case of A.",
        "Again, each row vector of Z corresponds to a feature vector of a web pages.",
        "The new approximating form ˜A = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects, represented by features Z.",
        "The factor model actually maps each vertex, vi, into a vector zi = {zi,k; 1 ≤ k ≤ l} in the Rl space.",
        "We call the Rl space the factor space.",
        "Then, {zi} encodes the information of incoming and outgoing connectivity of vertices {vi}.",
        "The factor loadings, U, explain how these observed connections happened based on {zi}.",
        "Once we have the vector zi, we can use many traditional classification methods (such as SVMs) or clustering tools (such as K-Means) to perform the analysis.",
        "Illustration Based on a Synthetic Problem To further illustrate the advantages of the proposed link matrix factorization Eq. (2), let us consider the graph in Figure 1.",
        "Given v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 2: Summarize Figure 1 with a factor graph these observations, we can summarize the graph by grouping as factor graph depicted in Figure 2.",
        "In the next we preform the two factorization methods Eq. (2) and Eq. (1) on this link matrix.",
        "A good low-rank representation should reveal the structure of the factor graph.",
        "First we try PCA-like decomposition, solving Eq. (1) and obtaining Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 1. 0 0 0 0 0 −.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6 −.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 0 .7 .7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 .5 −.5 0 0 0 0 0 −0.6 −.7 .1 0 0 .0 .6 −.0 0 0 .8 −.4 .3 0 0 .2 −.2 −.9 .7 .7 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 We can see that the row vectors of v6 and v7 are the same in Z, indicating that v6 and v7 have the same hub attributes.",
        "The row vectors of v2 and v3 are the same in U, indicating that v2 and v3 have the same authority attributes.",
        "It is not clear to see the similarity between v4 and v5, because their inlinks (and outlinks) are different.",
        "Then, we factorize A by ZUZ via solving Eq. (2), and obtain the results Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.8 −.5 .3 −.1 −.0 −.0 .4 .6 −.1 −.4 −.0 .4 .6 −.1 −.4 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 .3 −.2 .3 −.4 .3 −.4 .5 .0 −.2 .6 −.4 .5 .0 −.2 .6 −.1 .1 −.4 −.8 −.4 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 −.1 −.2 −.4 .6 .7 .2 −.5 −.5 −.5 .0 .1 .1 .4 −.4 .3 .1 −.2 −.0 .3 −.1 −.3 .3 −.5 −.4 −.2 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 The resultant Z is very consistent with the clustering structure of vertices: the row vectors of v2 and v3 are the same, those of v4 and v5 are the same, those of v6 and v7 are the same.",
        "Even interestingly, if we add constraints to ensure Z and U be nonnegative, we have Z = U = 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 .9 0 0 0 0 0 1. 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .7 0 0 0 0 0 1. 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 which clearly tells the assignment of vertices to clusters from Z and the links of factor graph from U.",
        "When the interpretability is not critical in some tasks, for example, classification, we found that it achieves better accuracies without the nonnegative constraints.",
        "Given our above analysis, it is clear that the factorization ZUZ is more expressive than ZU in representing the link matrix A. 3.2 Content Matrix Factorization Now let us consider the content information on the vertices.",
        "To combine the link information and content information, we want to use the same latent space to approximate the content as the latent space for the links.",
        "Using the bag-of-words approach, we denote the content of web pages by an n×m matrix C, each of whose rows represents a document, each column represents a keyword, where m is the number of keywords.",
        "Like the latent semantic indexing (LSI) [8], the l-dimensional latent space for words is denoted by an m × l matrix V .",
        "Therefore, we use ZV to approximate matrix C, min V,Z C − ZV 2 F + β V 2 F , (3) where β is a small positive number, β V 2 F serves as a regularization term to improve the robustness. 3.3 Joint Link-Content Matrix Factorization There are many ways to employ both the content and link information for web page classification.",
        "Our idea in this paper is not to simply combine them, but rather to fuse them into a single, consistent, and compact feature representation.",
        "To achieve this goal, we solve the following problem, min U,V,Z n J (U, V, Z) def = A − ZUZ 2 F + α C − ZV 2 F + γ U 2 F + β V 2 F o . (4) Eq. (4) is the joined matrix factorization of A and C with regularization.",
        "The new representation Z is ensured to capture both the structures of the link matrix A and the content matrix C. Once we find the optimal Z, we can apply the traditional classification or clustering methods on vectorial data Z.",
        "The relationship among these matrices can be depicted as Figure 3.",
        "A Y C U Z V Figure 3: Relationship among the matrices.",
        "Node Y is the target of classification.",
        "Eq. (4) can be solved using gradient methods, such as the conjugate gradient method and quasi-Newton methods.",
        "Then main computation of gradient methods is evaluating the object function J and its gradients against variables, ∂J ∂U = Z ZUZ Z − Z AZ + γU, ∂J ∂V =α V Z Z − C Z + βV, ∂J ∂Z = ZU Z ZU + ZUZ ZU − A ZU − AZU + α ZV V − CV .",
        "Because of the sparsity of A, the computational complexity of multiplication of A and Z is O(µAl), where µA is the number of nonzero entries in A.",
        "Similarly, the computational complexity of C Z and CV is O(µC l), where µC is the number of nonzero entries in C. The computational complexity of the rest multiplications in the gradient computation is O(nl2 ).",
        "Therefore, the total computational complexity in one iteration is O(µAl + µC l + nl2 ).",
        "The number of links and the number of words in a web page are relatively small comparing to the number of web pages, and are almost constant as the number of web pages/documents increases, i.e. µA = O(n) and µC = O(n).",
        "Therefore, theoretically the computation time is almost linear to the number of web pages/documents, n. 4.",
        "SUPERVISED MATRIX FACTORIZATION Consider a web page classification problem.",
        "We can solve Eq. (4) to obtain Z as Section 3, then use a traditional classifier to perform classification.",
        "However, this approach does not take data labels into account in the first step.",
        "Believing that using data labels improves the accuracy by obtaining a better Z for the classification, we consider to use the data labels to guide the matrix factorization, called supervised matrix factorization [22].",
        "Because some data used in the matrix factorization have no label information, the supervised matrix factorization falls into the category of semi-supervised learning.",
        "Let C be the set of classes.",

        "C = {−1, 1}.",
        "Assume we know the labels {yi} for vertices in T ⊂ V. We want to find a hypothesis h : V → R, such that we assign vi to 1 when h(vi) ≥ 0, −1 otherwise.",

        "Here, w is the norm of the decision boundary.",
        "Similar to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [7], we can use the hinge loss to measure the loss, X i:vi∈T [1 − yih(vi)]+ , where [x]+ is x if x ≥ 0, 0 if x < 0.",
        "However, the hinge loss is not smooth at the hinge point, which makes it difficult to apply gradient methods on the problem.",
        "To overcome the difficulty, we use a smoothed version of hinge loss for each data point, g(yih(vi)), (6) where g(x) = 8 >< >: 0 when x ≥ 2, 1 − x when x ≤ 0, 1 4 (x − 2)2 when 0 < x < 2.",
        "We reduce a multiclass problem into multiple binary ones.",

                "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
                "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
                "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",

                "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
                "From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
                "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
                "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
                "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
                "For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
                "In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
                "However, link and content information have different properties.",
                "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",

                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",

                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample.",
                "It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page <br>classification</br>, by exploiting both the content and the link structure.",
                "The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.",
                "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
                "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
                "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",

                "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page <br>classification</br> as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the <br>classification</br> problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf <br>classification</br> tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
                "From this point of view, the traditional <br>classification</br> methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
                "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
                "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
                "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
                "To improve the performance of web page <br>classification</br>, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
                "For example, in spam blog <br>classification</br>, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
                "In document <br>classification</br>, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
                "However, link and content information have different properties.",
                "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
                "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",
                "In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively.",
                "But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18].",
                "In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors.",
                "Our model contains two components.",

                "That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors.",
                "The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members.",
                "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",
                "Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.",
                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",
                "However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the relationship of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs.",
                "Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge.",
                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as <br>classification</br>.",
                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 reviews related work.",
                "Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content.",
                "Section 4 extends the basic framework and a few variants for fine tune.",
                "Section 5 shows the experiment results.",
                "Section 6 discusses the details of this approach and Section 7 concludes. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8].",
                "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
                "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
                "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
                "Analysis tasks, such as <br>classification</br>, could be performed on the latent space.",
                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
                "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
                "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",

                "The algorithm incorporates link structure and the co-citation patterns.",
                "In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph.",
                "The content information is only used for weighing the links by the textual similarity of both ends of the links.",
                "Zhang et al. [23] uses the undirected graph regularization framework for document <br>classification</br>.",

                "The framework combines the hub and authority information of web pages.",
                "But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework.",
                "Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors.",
                "Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5].",
                "The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.",
                "In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.",
                "In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page.",
                "In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS.",
                "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
                "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
                "In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page.",
                "As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph.",
                "Taskar et al. [19] propose relational Markov networks (RMNs) for entity <br>classification</br>, by describing a conditional distribution of entity classes given entity attributes and relationships.",

                "However the model does not give an off-the-shelf solution, because the success highly depends on the arts of designing the potential functions.",
                "On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation.",

                "This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample.",
                "It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving <br>web mining problem</br>s, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure.",
                "The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.",
                "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
                "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
                "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",
                "In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION With the advance of the World Wide Web, more and more hypertext documents become available on the Web.",
                "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
                "From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
                "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
                "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
                "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
                "For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
                "In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
                "However, link and content information have different properties.",
                "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
                "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",
                "In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively.",
                "But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18].",
                "In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors.",
                "Our model contains two components.",
                "The first component captures the content information.",
                "This component has a form similar to that of the latent topics in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8] in traditional information retrieval.",
                "That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors.",
                "The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members.",
                "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",
                "Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.",
                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",
                "However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the relationship of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs.",
                "Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge.",
                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",
                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 reviews related work.",
                "Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content.",
                "Section 4 extends the basic framework and a few variants for fine tune.",
                "Section 5 shows the experiment results.",
                "Section 6 discusses the details of this approach and Section 7 concludes. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8].",
                "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
                "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
                "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
                "Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space.",
                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
                "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
                "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",
                "He et al. [9] propose a clustering algorithm for web document clustering.",
                "The algorithm incorporates link structure and the co-citation patterns.",
                "In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph.",
                "The content information is only used for weighing the links by the textual similarity of both ends of the links.",
                "Zhang et al. [23] uses the undirected graph regularization framework for document classification.",
                "Achlioptas et al[2] decompose the web into hub and authority attributes then combine them with content.",
                "Zhou et al. [25] and [24] propose a directed graph regularization framework for semi-supervised learning.",
                "The framework combines the hub and authority information of web pages.",
                "But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework.",
                "Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors.",
                "Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5].",
                "The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.",
                "In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.",
                "In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page.",
                "In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS.",
                "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
                "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
                "In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page.",
                "As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph.",
                "Taskar et al. [19] propose relational Markov networks (RMNs) for entity classification, by describing a conditional distribution of entity classes given entity attributes and relationships.",
                "The model was applied to web page classification, where web pages are entities and hyperlinks are treated as relationships.",
                "RMNs apply conditional random fields to define a set of potential functions on cliques of random variables, where the link structure provides hints to form the cliques.",
                "However the model does not give an off-the-shelf solution, because the success highly depends on the arts of designing the potential functions.",
                "On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation.",
                "The following are some work on combining documents and links, but the methods are loosely related to our approach.",
                "The experiments of [21] show that using terms from the linked document improves the classification accuracy.",
                "Chakrabarti et al. [3] use co-citation information in their classification model.",
                "Joachims et al. [11] combine text kernels and co-citation kernels for classification.",
                "Oh et al [16] use the Naive Bayesian frame to combine link information with content. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In this section we will first introduce a novel matrix factorization method, which is more suitable than conventional matrix factorization methods for link analysis.",
                "Then we will introduce our approach that jointly factorizes the document-term matrix and link matrix and obtains compact and highly indicative factors for representing documents or web pages. 3.1 Link Matrix Factorization Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V, E), where the vertex set V = {vi}n i=1 represents the web pages and the edge set E represents the hyperlinks between web pages.",
                "Let A = {asd} denotes the n×n adjacency matrix of G, which is also called the link matrix in this paper.",
                "For a pair of vertices, vs and vd, let asd = 1 when there is an edge from vs to vd, and asd = 0, otherwise.",
                "Note that A is an asymmetric matrix, because hyperlinks are directed.",
                "Most machine learning algorithms assume a feature-vector representation of instances.",
                "For web page classification, however, the link graph does not readily give such a vector representation for web pages.",
                "If one directly uses each row or column of A for the job, she will suffer a very high computational cost because the dimensionality equals to the number of web pages.",
                "On the other hand, it will produces a poor classification accuracy (see our experiments in Section 5), because A is extremely sparse1 .",
                "The idea of link matrix factorization is to derive a high-quality feature representation Z of web pages based on analyzing the link matrix A, where Z is an n × l matrix, with each row being the ldimensional feature vector of a web page.",
                "The new representation of web pages captures the principal factors of the link structure and makes further processing more efficient.",
                "One may use a method similar to LSI, to apply the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) for deriving Z from A.",
                "The corresponding optimization problem 2 is min Z,U A − ZU 2 F + γ U 2 F (1) where γ is a small positive number, U is an l ×n matrix, and · F is the Frobenius norm.",
                "The optimization aims to approximate A by ZU , a product of two low-rank matrices, with a regularization on U.",
                "In the end, the i-th row vector of Z can be thought as the hub feature vector of vertex vi, and the row vector of U can be thought as the authority features.",
                "A link generation model proposed in [2] is similar to the PCA approach.",
                "Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20]. 1 Due to the sparsity of A, links from two similar pages may not share any common target pages, which makes them to appear dissimilar.",
                "However the two pages may be indirectly linked to many common pages via their neighbors. 2 Another equivalent form is minZ,U A − ZU 2 F , s. t. U U = I.",
                "The solution Z is identical subject to a scaling factor.",
                "However, despite its popularity in matrix analysis, PCA (or other similar methods like PLSA) is restrictive for link matrix factorization.",
                "The major problem is that, PCA ignores the fact that the rows and columns of A are indexed by exactly the same set of objects (i.e., web pages).",
                "The approximating matrix ˜A = ZU shows no evidence that links are within the same set of objects.",
                "To see the drawback, lets consider a link transitivity situation vi → vs → vj, where page i is linked to page s which itself is linked to page j.",
                "Since ˜A = ZU treats A as links from web pages {vi} to a different set of objects, let it be denoted by {oi}, ˜A = ZU actually splits an linked object os from vs and breaks down the link path into two parts vi → os and vs → oj.",
                "This is obviously a miss interpretation to the original link path.",
                "To overcome the problem of PCA, in this paper we suggest to use a different factorization: min Z,U A − ZUZ 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) where U is an l × l full matrix.",
                "Note that U is not symmetric, thus ZUZ produces an asymmetric matrix, which is the case of A.",
                "Again, each row vector of Z corresponds to a feature vector of a web pages.",
                "The new approximating form ˜A = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects, represented by features Z.",
                "The factor model actually maps each vertex, vi, into a vector zi = {zi,k; 1 ≤ k ≤ l} in the Rl space.",
                "We call the Rl space the factor space.",
                "Then, {zi} encodes the information of incoming and outgoing connectivity of vertices {vi}.",
                "The factor loadings, U, explain how these observed connections happened based on {zi}.",
                "Once we have the vector zi, we can use many traditional classification methods (such as SVMs) or clustering tools (such as K-Means) to perform the analysis.",
                "Illustration Based on a Synthetic Problem To further illustrate the advantages of the proposed link matrix factorization Eq. (2), let us consider the graph in Figure 1.",
                "Given v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 2: Summarize Figure 1 with a factor graph these observations, we can summarize the graph by grouping as factor graph depicted in Figure 2.",

                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and <br>content information</br> should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",

                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and <br>content information</br> separately and then combine them.",

                "This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample.",
                "It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure.",
                "The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.",
                "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only <br>authority information</br> with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
                "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
                "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",
                "In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION With the advance of the World Wide Web, more and more hypertext documents become available on the Web.",
                "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
                "From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
                "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
                "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
                "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
                "For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
                "In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
                "However, link and content information have different properties.",
                "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric relationship whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
                "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",
                "In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively.",
                "But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18].",
                "In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors.",
                "Our model contains two components.",
                "The first component captures the content information.",
                "This component has a form similar to that of the latent topics in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8] in traditional information retrieval.",
                "That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors.",
                "The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members.",
                "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",
                "Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.",
                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",
                "However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the relationship of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs.",
                "Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge.",
                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",
                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 reviews related work.",
                "Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content.",
                "Section 4 extends the basic framework and a few variants for fine tune.",
                "Section 5 shows the experiment results.",
                "Section 6 discusses the details of this approach and Section 7 concludes. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8].",
                "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
                "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
                "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
                "Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space.",
                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
                "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
                "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",
                "He et al. [9] propose a clustering algorithm for web document clustering.",
                "The algorithm incorporates link structure and the co-citation patterns.",
                "In the algorithm, all links are treated as undirected edge of the link graph.",
                "The content information is only used for weighing the links by the textual similarity of both ends of the links.",
                "Zhang et al. [23] uses the undirected graph regularization framework for document classification.",
                "Achlioptas et al[2] decompose the web into hub and authority attributes then combine them with content.",
                "Zhou et al. [25] and [24] propose a directed graph regularization framework for semi-supervised learning.",
                "The framework combines the hub and <br>authority information</br> of web pages.",
                "But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework.",
                "Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors.",
                "Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5].",
                "The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.",
                "In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.",
                "In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page.",
                "In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS.",
                "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
                "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
                "In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page.",
                "As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph.",
                "Taskar et al. [19] propose relational Markov networks (RMNs) for entity classification, by describing a conditional distribution of entity classes given entity attributes and relationships.",
                "The model was applied to web page classification, where web pages are entities and hyperlinks are treated as relationships.",
                "RMNs apply conditional random fields to define a set of potential functions on cliques of random variables, where the link structure provides hints to form the cliques.",
                "However the model does not give an off-the-shelf solution, because the success highly depends on the arts of designing the potential functions.",
                "On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation.",
                "The following are some work on combining documents and links, but the methods are loosely related to our approach.",
                "The experiments of [21] show that using terms from the linked document improves the classification accuracy.",
                "Chakrabarti et al. [3] use co-citation information in their classification model.",

                "Oh et al [16] use the Naive Bayesian frame to combine link information with content. 3.",
                "OUR APPROACH In this section we will first introduce a novel matrix factorization method, which is more suitable than conventional matrix factorization methods for link analysis.",
                "Then we will introduce our approach that jointly factorizes the document-term matrix and link matrix and obtains compact and highly indicative factors for representing documents or web pages. 3.1 Link Matrix Factorization Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V, E), where the vertex set V = {vi}n i=1 represents the web pages and the edge set E represents the hyperlinks between web pages.",
                "Let A = {asd} denotes the n×n adjacency matrix of G, which is also called the link matrix in this paper.",
                "For a pair of vertices, vs and vd, let asd = 1 when there is an edge from vs to vd, and asd = 0, otherwise.",
                "Note that A is an asymmetric matrix, because hyperlinks are directed.",
                "Most machine learning algorithms assume a feature-vector representation of instances.",
                "For web page classification, however, the link graph does not readily give such a vector representation for web pages.",
                "If one directly uses each row or column of A for the job, she will suffer a very high computational cost because the dimensionality equals to the number of web pages.",
                "On the other hand, it will produces a poor classification accuracy (see our experiments in Section 5), because A is extremely sparse1 .",
                "The idea of link matrix factorization is to derive a high-quality feature representation Z of web pages based on analyzing the link matrix A, where Z is an n × l matrix, with each row being the ldimensional feature vector of a web page.",
                "The new representation of web pages captures the principal factors of the link structure and makes further processing more efficient.",
                "One may use a method similar to LSI, to apply the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) for deriving Z from A.",
                "The corresponding optimization problem 2 is min Z,U A − ZU 2 F + γ U 2 F (1) where γ is a small positive number, U is an l ×n matrix, and · F is the Frobenius norm.",
                "The optimization aims to approximate A by ZU , a product of two low-rank matrices, with a regularization on U.",
                "In the end, the i-th row vector of Z can be thought as the hub feature vector of vertex vi, and the row vector of U can be thought as the authority features.",
                "A link generation model proposed in [2] is similar to the PCA approach.",
                "Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20]. 1 Due to the sparsity of A, links from two similar pages may not share any common target pages, which makes them to appear dissimilar.",
                "However the two pages may be indirectly linked to many common pages via their neighbors. 2 Another equivalent form is minZ,U A − ZU 2 F , s. t. U U = I.",
                "The solution Z is identical subject to a scaling factor.",
                "However, despite its popularity in matrix analysis, PCA (or other similar methods like PLSA) is restrictive for link matrix factorization.",
                "The major problem is that, PCA ignores the fact that the rows and columns of A are indexed by exactly the same set of objects (i.e., web pages).",
                "The approximating matrix ˜A = ZU shows no evidence that links are within the same set of objects.",
                "To see the drawback, lets consider a link transitivity situation vi → vs → vj, where page i is linked to page s which itself is linked to page j.",
                "Since ˜A = ZU treats A as links from web pages {vi} to a different set of objects, let it be denoted by {oi}, ˜A = ZU actually splits an linked object os from vs and breaks down the link path into two parts vi → os and vs → oj.",
                "This is obviously a miss interpretation to the original link path.",
                "To overcome the problem of PCA, in this paper we suggest to use a different factorization: min Z,U A − ZUZ 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) where U is an l × l full matrix.",
                "Note that U is not symmetric, thus ZUZ produces an asymmetric matrix, which is the case of A.",
                "Again, each row vector of Z corresponds to a feature vector of a web pages.",
                "The new approximating form ˜A = ZUZ puts a clear meaning that the links are between the same set of objects, represented by features Z.",
                "The factor model actually maps each vertex, vi, into a vector zi = {zi,k; 1 ≤ k ≤ l} in the Rl space.",
                "We call the Rl space the factor space.",
                "Then, {zi} encodes the information of incoming and outgoing connectivity of vertices {vi}.",
                "The factor loadings, U, explain how these observed connections happened based on {zi}.",
                "Once we have the vector zi, we can use many traditional classification methods (such as SVMs) or clustering tools (such as K-Means) to perform the analysis.",
                "Illustration Based on a Synthetic Problem To further illustrate the advantages of the proposed link matrix factorization Eq. (2), let us consider the graph in Figure 1.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",

                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",

                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",

                "Therefore, we can apply other types of loss, such as hinge loss or smoothed hinge loss, e.g.",
                "LA(U, Z) = µh(A, ZUZ ), where h(A, B) =P i,j [1 − AijBij]+ .",

                "The values of the entries are the weights of linear model, instead of the probabilities of web pages belonging to latent topics.",
                "Therefore, we allow the components take any possible real values.",
                "When we come to the clustering application, we can use this model to find Z, then apply K-means to partition the web pages into clusters.",
                "Actually, we can use the idea of nonnegative matrix factorization for clustering [20] to directly cluster web pages.",
                "As the example with nonnegative constraints shown in Section 3, we represent each cluster by a latent topic, i.e. the dimensionality of the latent space is set to the number of clusters we want.",
                "Then the problem of Eq. (4) becomes min U,V,Z J (U, V, Z), s.t.Z ≥ 0. (9) Solving Eq. (9), we can obtain more interpretable results, which could be used for clustering. 7.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",

                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",

                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",

                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",

                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",

                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",

                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",

                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",

                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",

                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",

                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",

                "This huge database violates the assumption held by most of conventional statistical methods that each web page is considered as an independent and identical sample.",
                "It is thus difficult to apply traditional mining or learning methods for solving web mining problems, e.g., web page classification, by exploiting both the content and the link structure.",
                "The research in this direction has recently received considerable attention but are still in an early stage.",
                "Though a few methods exploit both the link structure or the content information, some of them combine the only authority information with the content information, and the others first decompose the link structure into hub and authority features, then apply them as additional document features.",
                "Being practically attractive for its great simplicity, this paper aims to design an algorithm that exploits both the content and linkage information, by carrying out a joint factorization on both the linkage adjacency matrix and the document-term matrix, and derives a new representation for web pages in a low-dimensional factor space, without explicitly separating them as content, hub or authority factors.",
                "Further analysis can be performed based on the compact representation of web pages.",
                "In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates an excellent accuracy in hypertext classification on the WebKB and Cora benchmarks.",

                "INTRODUCTION With the advance of the World Wide Web, more and more hypertext documents become available on the Web.",
                "Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages (e.g, the WebKB benchmark data set, which contains university web pages), research papers (e.g., data in CiteSeer), online news articles, and customer-generated media (e.g., blogs).",
                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the <br>relationship</br> among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",
                "From this point of view, the traditional classification methods that ignore the link structure may not be suitable.",
                "On the other hand, a few studies, for example [25], rely solely on link structures.",
                "It is however a very rare case that content information can be ignorable.",
                "For example, in the Cora dataset, the content of a research article abstract largely determines the category of the article.",
                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",
                "For example, in spam blog classification, Kolari et al. [13] concatenate outlink features with the content features of the blog.",
                "In document classification, Kurland and Lee [14] convert content similarity among documents into weights of links.",
                "However, link and content information have different properties.",
                "For example, a link is an actual piece of evidence that represents an asymmetric <br>relationship</br> whereas the content similarity is usually defined conceptually for every pair of documents in a symmetric way.",
                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using cocitation similarity, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
                "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",
                "In turns, v4 and v5 should be similar to each other, since v4 and v5 cite similar web pages v6 and v7, respectively.",
                "But using cocitation similarity, the similarity between v4 and v5 is zero without considering other information. v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 Figure 1: An example of link structure In this paper, we propose a simple technique for analyzing inter-connected documents, such as web pages, using factor analysis[18].",
                "In the proposed technique, both content information and link structures are seamlessly combined through a single set of latent factors.",
                "Our model contains two components.",
                "The first component captures the content information.",
                "This component has a form similar to that of the latent topics in the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8] in traditional information retrieval.",
                "That is, documents are decomposed into latent topics/factors, which in turn are represented as term vectors.",
                "The second component captures the information contained in the underlying link structure, such as links from homepages of students to those of faculty members.",
                "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",
                "Instead, similar to LSI, the factors are learned from the data.",
                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",
                "However, in analysis of link structures, we need to model the <br>relationship</br> of two ends of links, i.e., edges between vertex pairs.",
                "Therefore, the model should involve factors of both vertices of the edge.",
                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",
                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 reviews related work.",
                "Section 3 presents the proposed approach to analyze the web page based on the combined information of links and content.",

                "RELATED WORK In the content analysis part, our approach is closely related to Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [8].",
                "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
                "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
                "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
                "Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space.",
                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
                "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
                "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",

                "But it is difficult to combine the content information into that framework.",
                "Our approach consider the content and the directed linkage between topics of source and destination web pages in one step, which implies the topic combines the information of web page as authorities and as hubs in a single set of factors.",
                "Cohn and Hofmann [6] construct the latent space from both content and link information, using content analysis based on probabilistic LSI (PLSI) [10] and link analysis based on PHITS [5].",
                "The major difference between the approach of [6] (PLSI+PHITS) and our approach is in the part of link analysis.",
                "In PLSI+PHITS, the link is constructed with the linkage from the topic of the source web page to the destination web page.",
                "In the model, the outgoing links of the destination web page have no effect on the source web page.",
                "In other words, the overall link structure is not utilized in PHITS.",
                "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
                "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
                "In turn, such information is passed to the factor of the source web page.",
                "As the result of matrix factorization, the factor forms a factor graph, a miniature of the original graph, preserving the major structure of the original graph.",

                "On the other hand, the inference for RMNs is intractable and requires belief propagation.",
                "The following are some work on combining documents and links, but the methods are loosely related to our approach.",

                "On the other hand, it will produces a poor classification accuracy (see our experiments in Section 5), because A is extremely sparse1 .",
                "The idea of link matrix factorization is to derive a high-quality feature representation Z of web pages based on analyzing the link matrix A, where Z is an n × l matrix, with each row being the ldimensional feature vector of a web page.",

                "The optimization aims to approximate A by ZU , a product of two low-rank matrices, with a regularization on U.",
                "In the end, the i-th row vector of Z can be thought as the hub feature vector of vertex vi, and the row vector of U can be thought as the authority features.",
                "A link generation model proposed in [2] is similar to the PCA approach.",
                "Since A is a nonnegative matrix here, one can also consider to put nonnegative constraints on U and Z, which produces an algorithm similar to PLSA [10] and NMF [20]. 1 Due to the sparsity of A, links from two similar pages may not share any common target pages, which makes them to appear dissimilar.",
                "However the two pages may be indirectly linked to many common pages via their neighbors. 2 Another equivalent form is minZ,U A − ZU 2 F , s. t. U U = I.",

                "Since ˜A = ZU treats A as links from web pages {vi} to a different set of objects, let it be denoted by {oi}, ˜A = ZU actually splits an linked object os from vs and breaks down the link path into two parts vi → os and vs → oj.",
                "This is obviously a miss interpretation to the original link path.",
                "To overcome the problem of PCA, in this paper we suggest to use a different factorization: min Z,U A − ZUZ 2 F + γ U 2 F (2) where U is an l × l full matrix.",

                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "Comparing to data in traditional information management, in addition to content, these data on the Web also contain links: e.g., hyperlinks from a students homepage pointing to the homepage of her advisor, paper citations, sources of a news article, comments of one blogger on posts from another blogger, and so on.",
                "Performing information management tasks on such structured data raises many new research challenges.",
                "In the following discussion, we use the task of web page classification as an illustrating example, while the techniques we develop in later sections are applicable equally well to many other tasks in information retrieval and data mining.",
                "For the classification problem of web pages, a simple approach is to treat web pages as independent documents.",
                "The advantage of this approach is that many off-the-shelf classification tools can be directly applied to the problem.",
                "However, this approach relies only on the content of web pages and ignores the structure of links among them.",
                "Link structures provide invaluable information about properties of the documents as well as relationships among them.",
                "For example, in the WebKB dataset, the link structure provides additional insights about the relationship among documents (e.g., links often pointing from a student to her advisor or from a faculty member to his projects).",
                "Since some links among these documents imply the inter-dependence among the documents, the usual i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) assumption of documents does not hold any more.",

                "To improve the performance of web page classification, therefore, both link structure and content information should be taken into consideration.",
                "To achieve this goal, a simple approach is to convert one type of information to the other.",

                "Therefore, directly converting one type of information to the other usually degrades the quality of information.",
                "On the other hand, there exist some studies, as we will discuss in detail in related work, that consider link information and content information separately and then combine them.",
                "We argue that such an approach ignores the inherent consistency between link and content information and therefore fails to combine the two seamlessly.",
                "Some work, such as [3], incorporates link information using <br>cocitation similarity</br>, but this may not fully capture the global link structure.",
                "In Figure 1, for example, web pages v6 and v7 co-cite web page v8, implying that v6 and v7 are similar to each other.",

                "A factor can be loosely considered as a type of documents (e.g., those homepages belonging to students).",
                "It is worth noting that we do not explicitly define the semantic of a factor a priori.",

                "Traditional factor analysis models the variables associated with entities through the factors.",

                "This is a key difference between traditional factor analysis and our model.",
                "In our model, we connect two components through a set of shared factors, that is, the latent factors in the second component (for contents) are tied to the factors in the first component (for links).",
                "By doing this, we search for a unified set of latent factors that best explains both content and link structures simultaneously and seamlessly.",
                "In the formulation, we perform factor analysis based on matrix factorization: solution to the first component is based on factorizing the term-document matrix derived from content features; solution to the second component is based on factorizing the adjacency matrix derived from links.",
                "Because the two factorizations share a common base, the discovered bases (latent factors) explain both content information and link structures, and are then used in further information management tasks such as classification.",

                "LSI maps documents into a lower dimensional latent space.",
                "The latent space implicitly captures a large portion of information of documents, therefore it is called the latent semantic space.",
                "The similarity between documents could be defined by the dot products of the corresponding vectors of documents in the latent space.",
                "Analysis tasks, such as classification, could be performed on the latent space.",
                "The commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method ensures that the data points in the latent space can optimally reconstruct the original documents.",
                "Though our approach also uses latent space to represent web pages (documents), we consider the link structure as well as the content of web pages.",
                "In the link analysis approach, the framework of hubs and authorities (HITS) [12] puts web page into two categories, hubs and authorities.",
                "Using recursive notion, a hub is a web page with many outgoing links to authorities, while an authority is a web page with many incoming links from hubs.",
                "Instead of using two categories, PageRank [17] uses a single category for the recursive notion, an authority is a web page with many incoming links from authorities.",

                "In our approach, the link is constructed with the linkage between the factor of the source web page and the factor of the destination web page, instead of the destination web page itself.",
                "The factor of the destination web page contains information of its outgoing links.",
