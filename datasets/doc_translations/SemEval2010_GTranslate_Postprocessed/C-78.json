To a large extent, such systems operate proactively and independently of direct human control driven by the perception of the environment and the ability to organize respective computations dynamically. The challenging characteristics of these applications include sentience and autonomy of components, issues of responsiveness and safety criticality, geographical dispersion, mobility and evolution. A crucial design decision is the choice of the appropriate abstractions and interaction mechanisms. Looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical components, hardware and software and a network interface, thus these components have different characteristics compared to pure software components. They are able to spontaneously disseminate information in response to events observed in the physical environment or to events received from other component via the network interface. Larger autonomous components may be composed recursively from these building blocks.

INTRODUCTION In recent years we have seen the continuous improvement of technologies that are relevant for the construction of distributed embedded systems, including trustworthy visual, auditory, and location sensing [11], communication and processing. We believe that in a future networked physical world a new class of applications will emerge, composed of a myriad of smart sensors and actuators to assess and control aspects of their environments and autonomously act in response to it. The anticipated challenging characteristics of these applications include autonomy, responsiveness and safety criticality, large scale, geographical dispersion, mobility and evolution. In order to deal with these challenges, it is of fundamental importance to use adequate high-level models, abstractions and interaction paradigms. Unfortunately, when facing the specific characteristics of the target systems, the shortcomings of current architectures and middleware interaction paradigms become apparent. Looking to the basic building blocks of such systems we may find components which comprise mechanical parts, hardware, software and a network interface. However, classical event/object models are usually software oriented and, as such, when trans28 ported to a real-time, embedded systems setting, their harmony is cluttered by the conflict between, on the one side, send/receive of software events (message-based), and on the other side, input/output of hardware or real-world events, register-based. In terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security. This paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware, supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on event-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the system. When choosing the appropriate interaction paradigm it is of fundamental importance to address the challenging issues of the envisaged sentient applications. Unlike classical approaches that confine the possible interactions to the application boundaries, i.e. to its components, we consider that the environment surrounding the application also plays a relevant role in this respect. Therefore, the paper starts by clarifying several issues concerning our view of the system, about the interactions that may take place and about the information flows. This view is complemented by providing an outline of the component-based system construction and, in particular, by showing that it is possible to compose larger applications from basic components, following an hierarchical composition approach. This provides the necessary background to introduce the Generic-Events Architecture (GEAR), which describes the event-based interaction between the components via a generic event layer while allowing the seamless integration of physical and computer information flows. In fact, the generic event layer hides the different communication channels, including the interactions through the environment. Additionally, the event layer abstraction is also adequate for the proper handling of the non-functional requirements, namely reliability and timeliness, which are particularly stringent in real-time settings. The paper devotes particular attention to this issue by discussing the temporal aspects of interactions and the needs for predictability. An appropriate middleware is presented which reflects these needs and allows to specify events which have quality attributes to express temporal constraints. This is complemented by the notion of Event Channels (EC), which are abstractions of the underlying network while being abstracted by the event layer. In fact, event channels play a fundamental role in securing the functional and non-functional (e.g. reliability and timeliness) properties of the envisaged applications, that is, in allowing the enforcement of quality attributes. They are established prior to interaction to reserve the needed computational and network resources for highly predictable event dissemination. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we introduce the fundamental notions and abstractions that we adopt in this work to describe the interactions taking place in the system. Then, in Section 4, we describe the componentbased approach that allows composition of objects. GEAR is then described in Section 5 and Section 6 focuses on temporal aspects of the interactions. Section 7 describes the COSMIC middleware, which may be used to specify the interaction between sentient objects. A simple example to highlight the ideas presented in the paper appears in Section 8 and Section 9 concludes the paper. 2. RELATED WORK Our work considers a wired physical world in which a very large number of autonomous components cooperate. It is inspired by many research efforts in very different areas. Event-based systems in general have been introduced to meet the requirements of applications in which entities spontaneously generate information and disseminate it [1, 25, 22]. Intended for large systems and requiring quite complex infrastructures, these event systems do not consider stringent quality aspects like timeliness and dependability issues. Secondly, they are not created to support inter-operability between tiny smart devices with substantial resource constraints. In [10] a real-time event system for CORBA has been introduced. The events are routed via a central event server which provides scheduling functions to support the real-time requirements. Such a central component is not available in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture and the developed middleware TAO (The Ace Orb) is quite complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart devices. There are efforts to implement CORBA for control networks, tailored to connect sensor and actuator components [15, 19]. They are targeted for the CAN-Bus [9], a popular network developed for the automotive industry. However, in these approaches the support for timeliness or dependability issues does not exist or is only very limited. A new scheme to integrate smart devices in a CORBA environment is proposed in [17] and has lead to the proposal of a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) [26]. Smart transducers are organized in clusters that are connected to a CORBA system by a gateway. The clusters form isolated subnetworks. A special master node enforces the temporal properties in the cluster subnet. A CORBA gateway allows to access sensor data and write actuator data by means of an interface file system (IFS). The basic structure is similar to the WAN-of-CANs structure which has been introduced in the CORTEX project [4]. Islands of tight control may be realized by a control network and cooperate via wired or wireless networks covering a large number of these subnetworks. However, in contrast to the event channel model introduced in this paper, all communication inside a cluster relies on a single technical solution of a synchronous communication channel. Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3. INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5]. As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it. These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12]. Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects. Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein. Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes. The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space. The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation. Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter. Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction. We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects. The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries. Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door. On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it). The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators. We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1). Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2. State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system. In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model. Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic. A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it. Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects. In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors. Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path. In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment. It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30]. Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs. On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions. As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4. SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task. We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events. This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator. Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle. Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary. On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated. Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network. Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object. However, there is a subtle difference between both cases. While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter. In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects. To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots. Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers. Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object. On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body. This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body. From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world. As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object. However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting. Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture. Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely. Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones. Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics. Consider a platoon of cooperating vehicles. Inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] or LIN [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth. On the other hand, the vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link. Finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer. At the abstraction level of sentient objects, such heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment. At the network level, we assume the WAN-of-CANs structure [27] to model the different networks. The notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively defined component-based object model. A body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service container for the sentient objects inside. On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a certain CAN. A CAN defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects. In the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see Figure 1). Correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone. At the network level, the wireless network represents the respective CAN. However, several platoons united by their CANs may interact with each other and objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of WAN-of-CANs. The notions of body-environment and WAN-of-CANs are very useful when defining interaction properties across such boundaries. Their introduction obeyed to our belief that a single mechanism to provide quality measures for interactions is not appropriate. Instead, a high level construct for interaction across boundaries is needed which allows to specify the quality of dissemination and exploits the knowledge about body and environment to assess the feasibility of quality constraints. As we will see in the following section, the notion of an event channel represents this construct in our architecture. It disseminates events and allows the network independent specification of quality attributes. These attributes must be mapped to the respective properties of the underlying network structure. 5. A GENERIC EVENTS ARCHITECTURE In order to successfully apply event-based object-oriented models, addressing the challenges enumerated in the introduction of this paper, it is necessary to use adequate architectural constructs, which allow the enforcement of fundamental properties such as timeliness or reliability. We propose the Generic-Events Architecture (GEAR), depicted in Figure 2, which we briefly describe in what follows (for a more detailed description please refer to [29]). The L-shaped structure is crucial to ensure some of the properties described. Environment: The physical surroundings, remote and close, solid and etherial, of sentient objects. 31 C o m m sC o m m sC o m m s T r a n s l a t i o n L a y e r T r a n s l a t i o n L a y e r B o d y E n v i r o n m e n t B o d y E n v i r o n m e n t B o d y E n v i r o n m e n t ( i n c l u d i n g o p e r a t i o n a l n e t w o r k ) ( o f o b j e c t o r o b j e c t c o m p o u n d ) T r a n s l a t i o n L a y e r T r a n s l a t i o n S e n t i e n t O b j e c t S e n t i e n t O b j e c t S e n t i e n t O b j e c t R e g u l a r N e t w o r k c o n s u m ep r o d u c e E v e n t L a y e r E v e n t L a y e r E v e n t L a y e r S e n t i e n t O b j e c t Figure 2: Generic-Events architecture. Body: The physical embodiment of a sentient object (e.g., the hardware where a mechatronic controller resides, the physical structure of a car). Note that due to the compositional approach taken in our model, part of what is environment to a smaller object seen individually, becomes body for a larger, containing object. In fact, the body is the internal environment of the object. This architecture layering allows composition to take place seamlessly, in what concerns information flow. Inside a body there may also be implicit knowledge, which can be exploited to make interaction more efficient, like the knowledge about the number of cooperating entities, the existence of a specific communication network or the simple fact that all components are co-located and thus the respective events do not need to specify location in their context attributes. Such intrinsic information is not available outside a body and, therefore, more explicit information has to be carried by an event. Translation Layer: The layer responsible for physical event transformation from/to their native form to event channel dialect, between environment/body and an event channel. Essentially one doing observation and actuation operations on the lower side, and doing transactions of event descriptions on the other. On the lower side this layer may also interact with dumb sensors or actuators, therefore talking the language of the specific device. These interactions are done through operational networks (hence the antenna symbol in the figure). Event Layer: The layer responsible for event propagation in the whole system, through several Event Channels (EC):. In concrete terms, this layer is a kind of middleware that provides important event-processing services which are crucial for any realistic event-based system. For example, some of the services that imply the processing of events may include publishing, subscribing, discrimination (zoning, filtering, fusion, tracing), and queuing. Communication Layer: The layer responsible for wrapping events (as a matter of fact, event descriptions in EC dialect) into carrier event-messages, to be transported to remote places. For example, a sensing event generated by a smart sensor is wrapped in an event-message and disseminated, to be caught by whoever is concerned. The same holds for an actuation event produced by a sentient object, to be delivered to a remote smart actuator. Likewise, this may apply to an event-message from one sentient object to another. Dumb sensors and actuators do not send event-messages, since they are unable to understand the EC dialect (they do not have an event layer neither a communication layer- they communicate, if needed, through operational networks). Regular Network: This is represented in the horizontal axis of the block diagram by the communication layer, which encompasses the usual LAN, TCP/IP, and realtime protocols, desirably augmented with reliable and/or ordered broadcast and other protocols. The GEAR introduces some innovative ideas in distributed systems architecture. While serving an object model based on production and consumption of generic events, it treats events produced by several sources (environment, body, objects) in a homogeneous way. This is possible due to the use of a common basic dialect for talking about events and due to the existence of the translation layer, which performs the necessary translation between the physical representation of a real-time entity and the EC compliant format. Crucial to the architecture is the event layer, which uses event channels to propagate events through regular network infrastructures. The event layer is realized by the COSMIC middleware, as described in Section 7. 5.1 Information Flow in GEAR The flow of information (external environment and computational part) is seamlessly supported by the L-shaped architecture. It occurs in a number of different ways, which demonstrates the expressiveness of the model with regard to the necessary forms of information encountered in real-time cooperative and embedded systems. Smart sensors produce events which report on the environment. Body sensors produce events which report on the body. They are disseminated by the local event layer module, on an event channel (EC) propagated through the regular network, to any relevant remote event layer modules where entities showed an interest on them, normally, sentient objects attached to the respective local event layer modules. Sentient objects consume events they are interested in, process them, and produce other events. Some of these events are destined to other sentient objects. They are published on an EC using the same EC dialect that serves, e.g., sensor originated events. However, these events are semantically of a kind such that they are to be subscribed by the relevant sentient objects, for example, the sentient objects composing a robot controller system, or, at a higher level, the sentient objects composing the actual robots in 32 a cooperative application. Smart actuators, on the other hand, merely consume events produced by sentient objects, whereby they accept and execute actuation commands. Alternatively to talking to other sentient objects, sentient objects can produce events of a lower level, for example, actuation commands on the body or environment. They publish these exactly the same way: on an event channel through the local event layer representative. Now, if these commands are of concern to local actuator units (e.g., body, including internal operational networks), they are passed on to the local translation layer. If they are of concern to a remote smart actuator, they are disseminated through the distributed event layer, to reach the former. In any case, if they are also of interest to other entities, such as other sentient objects that wish to be informed of the actuation command, then they are also disseminated through the EC to these sentient objects. A key advantage of this architecture is that event-messages and physical events can be globally ordered, if necessary, since they all pass through the event layer. The model also offers opportunities to solve a long lasting problem in realtime, computer control, and embedded systems: the inconsistency between message passing and the feedback loop information flow subsystems. 6. TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF THE INTERACTIONS Any interaction needs some form of predictability. If safety critical scenarios are considered as it is done in CORTEX, temporal aspects become crucial and have to be made explicit. The problem is how to define temporal constraints and how to enforce them by appropriate resource usage in a dynamic ad-hoc environment. In an system where interactions are spontaneous, it may be also necessary to determine temporal properties dynamically. To do this, the respective temporal information must be stated explicitly and available during run-time. Secondly, it is not always ensured that temporal properties can be fulfilled. In these cases, adaptations and timing failure notification must be provided [2, 28]. In most real-time systems, the notion of a deadline is the prevailing scheme to express and enforce timeliness. However, a deadline only weakly reflect the temporal characteristics of the information which is handled. Secondly, a deadline often includes implicit knowledge about the system and the relations between activities. In a rather well defined, closed environment, it is possible to make such implicit assumptions and map these to execution times and deadlines. E.g. the engineer knows how long a vehicle position can be used before the vehicle movement outdates this information. Thus he maps this dependency between speed and position on a deadline which then assures that the position error can be assumed to be bounded. In a open environment, this implicit mapping is not possible any more because, as an obvious reason, the relation between speed and position, and thus the error bound, cannot easily be reverse engineered from a deadline. Therefore, our event model includes explicit quality attributes which allow to specify the temporal attributes for every individual event. This is of course an overhead compared to the use of implicit knowledge, but in a dynamic environment such information is needed. To illustrate the problem, consider the example of the position of a vehicle. A position is a typical example for time, value entity [30]. Thus, the position is useful if we can determine an error bound which is related to time, e.g. if we want a position error below 10 meters to establish a safety property between cooperating cars moving with 5 m/sec, the position has a validity time of 2 seconds. In a time, value entity entity we can trade time against the precision of the value. This is known as value over time and time over value [18]. Once having established the time-value relation and captured in event attributes, subscribers of this event can locally decide about the usefulness of an information. In the GEAR architecture temporal validity is used to reason about safety properties in a event-based system [29]. We will briefly review the respective notions and see how they are exploited in our COSMIC event middleware. Consider the timeline of generating an event representing some real-time entity [18] from its occurrence to the notification of a certain sentient object (Figure 3). The real-time entity is captured at the sensor interface of the system and has to be transformed in a form which can be treated by a computer. During the time interval t0 the sensor reads the real-time entity and a time stamp is associated with the respective value. The derived time, value entity represents an observation. It may be necessary to perform substantial local computations to derive application relevant information from the raw sensor data. However, it should be noted that the time stamp of the observation is associated with the capture time and thus independent from further signal processing and event generation. This close relationship between capture time and the associated value is supported by smart sensors described above. The processed sensor information is assembled in an event data structure after ts to be published to an event channel. As is described later, the event includes the time stamp of generation and the temporal validity as attributes. The temporal validity is an application defined measure for the expiration of a time, value . As we explained in the example of a position above, it may vary dependent on application parameters. Temporal validity is a more general concept than that of a deadline. It is independent of a certain technical implementation of a system. While deadlines may be used to schedule the respective steps in an event generation and dissemination, a temporal validity is an intrinsic property of a time, value entity carried in an event. A temporal validity allows to reason about the usefulness of information and is beneficial even in systems in which timely dissemination of events cannot be enforced because it enables timing failure detection at the event consumer. It is obvious that deadlines or periods can be derived from the temporal validity of an event. To set a deadline, knowledge of an implementation, worst case execution times or message dissemination latencies is necessary. Thus, in the timeline of Figure 3 every interval may have a deadline. Event dissemination through soft real-time channels in COSMIC exploits the temporal validity to define dissemination deadlines. Quality attributes can be defined, for instance, in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs. These allow to characterize the usefulness of the event for a certain application, in a certain context. Because of that, quality attributes of an event clearly depend on higher level issues, such as the nature of the sentient object or of the smart sensor that produced the event. For instance, an event containing an indication of some vehicle speed must have different quality attributes depending on the kind of vehicle 33 real-world event observation: <time stamp, value> event generated ready to be transmitted event received notification , to t event producer communication network event consumer event channel push <event> , ts , tm , tt , tn , t o : t i m e t o o b t a i n a n o b s e r v a t i o n , t s : t i m e t o p r o c e s s s e n s o r r e a d i n g , t m : t i m e t o a s s e m b l e a n e v e n t m e s s a g e , t t : t i m e t o t r a n s f e r t h e e v e n t o n t h e r e g u l a r n e t w o r k , t n : t i m e f o r n o t i f i c a t i o n o n t h e c o n s u m e r s i t e Figure 3: Event processing and dissemination. from which it originated, or depending on its current speed. The same happens with the position event of the car example above, whose validity depends on the current speed and on a predefined required precision. However, since quality attributes are strictly related with the semantics of the application or, at least, with some high level knowledge of the purpose of the system (from which the validity of the information can be derived), the definition of these quality attributes may be done by exploiting the information provided at the programming interface. Therefore, it is important to understand how the system programmer can specify non-functional requirements at the API, and how these requirements translate into quality attributes assigned to events. While temporal validity is identified as an intrinsic event property, which is exploited to decide on the usefulness of data at a certain point in time, it is still necessary to provide a communication facility which can disseminate the event before the validity is expired. In a WAN-of-CANs network structure we have to cope with very different network characteristics and quality of service properties. Therefore, when crossing the network boundaries the quality of service guarantees available in a certain network will be lost and it will be very hard, costly and perhaps impossible to achieve these properties in the next larger area of the WAN-of CANs structure. CORTEX has a couple of abstractions to cope with this situation (network zones, body/environment) which have been discussed above. From the temporal point of view we need a high level abstraction like the temporal validity for the individual event now to express our quality requirements of the dissemination over the network. The bound, coverage pair, introduced in relation with the TCB [28] seems to be an appropriate approach. It considers the inherent uncertainty of networks and allows to trade the quality of dissemination against the resources which are needed. In relation with the event channel model discussed later, the bound, coverage pair allows to specify the quality properties of an event channel independently of specific technical issues. Given the typical environments in which sentient applications will operate, where it is difficult or even impossible to provide timeliness or reliability guarantees, we proposed an alternative way to handle non-functional application requirements, in relation with the TCB approach [28]. The proposed approach exploits intrinsic characteristics of applications, such as fail-safety, or time-elasticity, in order to secure QoS specifications of the form bound, coverage . Instead of constructing systems that rely on guaranteed bounds, the idea is to use (possibly changing) bounds that are secured with a constant probability all over the execution. This obviously requires an application to be able to adapt to changing conditions (and/or changing bounds) or, if this is not possible, to be able to perform some safety procedures when the operational conditions degrade to an unbearable level. The bounds we mentioned above refer essentially to timeliness bounds associated to the execution of local or distributed activities, or combinations thereof. From these bounds it is then possible to derive the quality attributes, in particular validity intervals, that characterize the events published in the event channel. 6.1 The Role of Smart Sensors and Actuators Smart devices encapsulate hardware, software and mechanical components and provide information and a set of well specified functions and which are closely related to the interaction with the environment. The built-in computational components and the network interface enable the implementation of a well-defined high level interface that does not just provide raw transducer data, but a processed, application-related set of events. Moreover, they exhibit an autonomous spontaneous behaviour. They differ from general purpose nodes because they are dedicated to a certain functionality which complies to their sensing and actuating capabilities while general purpose node may execute any program. Concerning the sentient object model, smart sensors and actuators may be basic sentient objects themselves, consuming events from the real-world environment and producing the respective generic events for the systems event layer or, 34 vice versa consuming a generic event and converting it to a real-world event by an actuation. Smart components therefore constitute the periphery, i.e. the real-world interface of a more complex sentient object. The model of sentient objects also constitutes the framework to built more complex virtual sensors by relating multiple (primary, i.e. sensors which directly sense a physical entity) sensors. Smart components translate events of the environment to an appropriate form available at the event layer or, vice versa, transform a system event into an actuation. For smart components we can assume that: • Smart components have dedicated resources to perform a specific function. • These resources are not used for other purposes during normal real-time operation. • No local temporal conflicts occur that will change the observable temporal behaviour. • The functions of a component can usually only be changed during a configuration procedure which is not performed when the component is involved in critical operations. • An observation of the environment as a time,value pair can be obtained with a bounded jitter in time. Many predictability and scheduling problems arise from the fact, that very low level timing behaviours have to be handled on a single processor. Here, temporal encapsulation of activities is difficult because of the possible side effects when sharing a single processor resource. Consider the control of a simple IR-range detector which is used for obstacle avoidance. Dependent on its range and the speed of a vehicle, it has to be polled to prevent the vehicle from crashing into an obstacle. On a single central processor, this critical activity has to be coordinated with many similar, possibly less critical functions. It means that a very fine grained schedule has to be derived based purely on the artifacts of the low level device control. In a smart sensor component, all this low level timing behaviour can be optimized and encapsulated. Thus we can assume temporal encapsulation similar to information hiding in the functional domain. Of course, there is still the problem to guarantee that an event will be disseminated and recognized in due time by the respective system components, but this relates to application related events rather than the low artifacts of a device timing. The main responsibility to provide timeliness guarantees is shifted to the event layer where these events are disseminated. Smart sensors thus lead to network centric system model. The network constitute the shared resource which has to be scheduled in a predictable way. The COSMIC middleware introduced in the next section is an approach to provide predictable event dissemination for a network of smart sensors and actuators. 7. AN EVENT MODEL ANDMIDDLEWARE FOR COOPERATING SMART DEVICES An event model and a middleware suitable for smart components must support timely and reliable communication and also must be resource efficient. COSMIC (COoperating Smart devices) is aimed at supporting the interaction between those components according to the concepts introduced so far. Based on the model of a WAN-of-CANs, we assume that the components are connected to some form of CAN as a fieldbus or a special wireless sensor network which provides specific network properties. E.g. a fieldbus developed for control applications usually includes mechanisms for predictable communication while other networks only support a best effort dissemination. A gateway connects these CANs to the next level in the network hierarchy. The event system should allow the dynamic interaction over a hierarchy of such networks and comply with the overall CORTEX generic event model. Events are typed information carriers and are disseminated in a publisher/ subscriber style [24, 7], which is particularly suitable because it supports generative, anonymous communication [3] and does not create any artificial control dependencies between producers of information and the consumers. This decoupling in space (no references or names of senders or receivers are needed for communication) and the flow decoupling (no control transfer occurs with a data transfer) are well known [24, 7, 14] and crucial properties to maintain autonomy of components and dynamic interactions. It is obvious that not all networks can provide the same QoS guarantees and secondly, applications may have widely differing requirements for event dissemination. Additionally, when striving for predictability, resources have to be reserved and data structures must be set up before communication takes place. Thus, these things can not predictably be made on the fly while disseminating an event. Therefore, we introduced the notion of an event channel to cope with differing properties and requirements and have an object to which we can assign resources and reservations. The concept of an event channel is not new [10, 25], however, it has not yet been used to reflect the properties of the underlying heterogeneous communication networks and mechanisms as described by the GEAR architecture. Rather, existing event middleware allows to specify the priorities or deadlines of events handled in an event server. Event channels allow to specify the communication properties on the level of the event system in a fine grained way. An event channel is defined by: event channel := subject, quality attributeList, handlers The subject determines the types of events event which may be issued to the channel. The quality attributes model the properties of the underlying communication network and dissemination scheme. These attributes include latency specifications, dissemination constraints and reliability parameters. The notion of zones which represent a guaranteed quality of service in a subnetwork support this approach. Our goal is to handle the temporal specifications as bound, coverage pairs [28] orthogonal to the more technical questions of how to achieve a certain synchrony property of the dissemination infrastructure. Currently, we support quality attributes of event channels in a CAN-Bus environment represented by explicit synchrony classes. The COSMIC middleware maps the channel properties to lower level protocols of the regular network. Based on our previous work on predictable protocols for the CAN-Bus, COSMIC defines an abstract network which provides hard, soft and non real-time message classes [21]. Correspondingly, we distinguish three event channel classes according to their synchrony properties: hard real-time channels, soft real-time channels and non-real-time channels. Hard real-time channels (HRTC) guarantee event propagation within the defined time constraints in the presence 35 of a specified number of omission faults. HRTECs are supported by a reservation scheme which is similar to the scheme used in time-triggered protocols like TTP [16][31], TTP/A [17], and TTCAN [8]. However, a substantial advantage over a TDMA scheme is that due to CAN-Bus properties, bandwidth which was reserved but is not needed by a HRTEC can be used by less critical traffic [21]. Soft real-time channels (SRTC) exploit the temporal validity interval of events to derive deadlines for scheduling. The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent. Therefore, in a real-time system an event is useless after this point and may me discarded. The transmission deadline (DL) is defined as the latest point in time when a message has to be transmitted and is specified in a time interval which is derived from the expiration time: tevent ready < DL < texpiration − ∆notification texpiration defines the point in time when the temporal validity expires. ∆notification is the expected end-to-end latency which includes the transfer time over the network and the time the event may be delayed by the local event handling in the nodes. As said before, event deadlines are used to schedule the dissemination by SRTECs. However, deadlines may be missed in transient overload situations or due to arbitrary arrival times of events. On the publisher side the applications exception handler is called whenever the event deadline expires before event transmission. At this point in time the event is also not expected to arrive at the subscriber side before the validity expires. Therefore, the event is removed from the sending queue. On the subscriber side the expiration time is used to schedule the delivery of the event. If the event cannot be delivered until its expiration time it is removed from the respective queues allocated by the COSMIC middleware. This prevents the communication system to be loaded by outdated messages. Non-real-time channels do not assume any temporal specification and disseminate events in a best effort manner. An instance of an event channel is created locally, whenever a publisher makes an announcement for publication or a subscriber subscribes for an event notification. When a publisher announces publication, the respective data structures of an event channel are created by the middleware. When a subscriber subscribes to an event channel, it may specify context attributes of an event which are used to filter events locally. E.g. a subscriber may only be interested in events generated at a certain location. Additionally the subscriber specifies quality properties of the event channel. A more detailed description of the event channels can be found in [13]. Currently, COSMIC handles all event channels which disseminate events beyond the CAN network boundary as non real-time event channels. This is mainly because we use the TCP/IP protocol to disseminate events over wireless links or to the standard Ethernet. However, there are a number of possible improvements which can easily be integrated in the event channel model. The Timely Computing Base (TCB) [28] can be exploited for timing failure detection and thus would provide awareness for event dissemination in environments where timely delivery of events cannot be enforced. Additionally, there are wireless protocols which can provide timely and reliable message delivery [6, 23] which may be exploited for the respective event channel classes. Events are the information carriers which are exchanged between sentient objects through event channels. To cope with the requirements of an ad-hoc environment, an event includes the description of the context in which it has been generated and quality attributes defining requirements for dissemination. This is particularly important in an open, dynamic environment where an event may travel over multiple networks. An event instance is specified as: event := subject, context attributeList, quality attributeList, contents A subject defines the type of the event and is related to the event contents. It supports anonymous communication and is used to route an event. The subject has to match to the subject of the event channel through which the event is disseminated. Attributes are complementary to the event contents. They describe individual functional and non-functional properties of the event. The context attributes describe the environment in which the event has been generated, e.g. a location, an operational mode or a time of occurrence. The quality attributes specify timeliness and dependability aspects in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs. The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent [18]. As described above, the temporal validity can be mapped to a deadline. However, usually a deadline is an engineering artefact which is used for scheduling while the temporal validity is a general property of a time, value entity. In a environment where a deadline cannot be enforced, a consumer of an event eventually must decide whether the event still is temporally consistent, i.e. represents a valid time, value entity. 7.1 The Architecture of the COSMIC Middleware On the architectural level, COSMIC distinguish three layers roughly depicted in Figure 4. Two of them, the event layer and the abstract network layer are implemented by the COSMIC middleware. The event layer provides the API for the application and realizes the abstraction of event and event channels. The abstract network implements real-time message classes and adapts the quality requirements to the underlying real network. An event channel handler resides in every node. It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication. Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved. It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14]. The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications. It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide. Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees. In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus. As can be seen in Figure 4, the hard real-time (HRT) message class is supported by a dedicated handler which is able to provide the time triggered message dissemination. 36 \u0014 event notifications HRT-msg list SRT-msg queue NRT-msg queue HRT-msg calendar HRTC Handler S/NRTC Handler Abstract Network Layer CAN Layer RX Buffer TX Buffer RX, TX, error interrupts Event Channel Specs.

The HRT handler maintains the HRT message list, which contains an entry for each local HRT message to be sent. The entry holds the parameters for the message, the activation status and the binding information. Messages are scheduled on the bus according to the HRT message calendar which comprises the precise start time for each time slot allocated for a message. Soft real-time message queues order outgoing messages according to their transmission deadlines derived from the temporal validity interval. If the transmission deadline is exceeded, the event message is purged out of the queue. The respective application is notified via the exception notification interface and can take actions like trying to publish the event again or publish it to a channel of another class. Incoming event messages are ordered according to their temporal validity. If an event message arrive, the respective applications are notified. At the moment, an outdated message is deleted from the queue and if the queue runs out of space, the oldest message is discarded. However, there are other policies possible depending on event attributes and available memory space. Non real-time messages are FIFO ordered in a fixed size circular buffer. 7.2 Status of COSMIC The goal for developing COSMIC was to provide a platform to seamlessly integrate smart tiny components in a large system. Therefore, COSMIC should run also on the small, resource constraint devices which are built around 16Bit or even 8-Bit micro-controllers. The distributed COSMIC middleware has been implemented and tested on various platforms. Under RT-Linux, we support the real-time channels over the CAN Bus as described above. The RTLinux version runs on Pentium processors and is currently evaluated before we intent to port it to a smart sensor or actuator. For the interoperability in a WAN-of-CANs environment, we only provide non real-time channels at the moment. This version includes a gateway between the CANbus and a TCP/IP network. It allows us to use a standard wireless 802.11 network. The non real-time version of COSMIC is available on Linux, RT-Linux and on the microcontroller families C167 (Infineon) and 68HC908 (Motorola). Both micro-controllers have an on-board CAN controller and thus do not require additional hardware components for the network. The memory footprint of COSMIC is about 13 Kbyte on a C167 and slightly more on the 68HC908 where it fits into the on-board flash memory without problems. Because only a few channels are required on such a smart sensor or actuator component, the requirement of RAM (which is a scarce resource on many single chip systems) to hold the dynamic data structures of a channel is low. The COSMIC middleware makes it very easy to include new smart sensors in an existing system. Particularly, the application running on a smart sensor to condition and process the raw physical data must not be aware of any low level network specific details. It seamlessly interacts with other components of the system exclusively via event channels. The demo example, briefly described in the next chapter, is using a distributed infrastructure of tiny smart sensors and actuators directly cooperating via event channels over heterogeneous networks. 8. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE A simple example for many important properties of the proposed system showing the coordination through the environment and events disseminated over the network is the demo of two cooperating robots depicted in Figure 5. Each robot is equipped with smart distance sensors, speed sensors, acceleration sensors and one of the robots (the guide (KURT2) in front (Figure 5)) has a tracking camera allowing to follow a white line. The robots form a WAN-of-CANs system in which their local CANs are interconnected via a wireless 802.11 network. COSMIC provides the event layer for seamless interaction. The blind robot (N.N.) is searching the guide randomly. Whenever the blind robot detects (by its front distance sensors) an obstacle, it checks whether this may be the guide. For this purpose, it dynamically subscribes to the event channel disseminating distance events from rear distance sensors of the guide(s) and compares these with the distance events from its local front sensors. If the distance is approximately the same it infers that it is really behind a guide. Now N.N. also subscribes to the event channels of the tracking camera and the speed sensors 37 Figure 5: Cooperating robots. to follow the guide. The demo application highlights the following properties of the system: 1. Dynamic interaction of robots which is not known in advance. In principle, any two a priori unknown robots can cooperate. All what publishers and subscribers have to know to dynamically interact in this environment is the subject of the respective event class. A problem will be to receive only the events of the robot which is closest. A robot identity does not help much to solve this problem. Rather, the position of the event generation entity which is captured in the respective attributes can be evaluated to filter the relevant event out of the event stream. A suitable wireless protocol which uses proximity to filter events has been proposed by Meier and Cahill [22] in the CORTEX project. 2. Interaction through the environment. The cooperation between the robots is controlled by sensing the distance between the robots. If the guide detects that the distance grows, it slows down. Respectively, if the blind robot comes too close it reduces its speed. The local distance sensors produce events which are disseminated through a low latency, highly predictable event channel. The respective reaction time can be calculated as function of the speed and the distance of the robots and define a dynamic dissemination deadline for events. Thus, the interaction through the environment will secure the safety properties of the application, i.e. the follower may not crash into the guide and the guide may not loose the follower. Additionally, the robots have remote subscriptions to the respective distance events which are used to check it with the local sensor readings to validate that they really follow the guide which they detect with their local sensors. Because there may be longer latencies and omissions, this check occasionally will not be possible. The unavailability of the remote events will decrease the quality of interaction and probably and slow down the robots, but will not affect safety properties. 3. Cooperative sensing. The blind robot subscribes to the events of the line tracking camera. Thus it can see through the eye of the guide. Because it knows the distance to the guide and the speed as well, it can foresee the necessary movements. The proposed system provides the architectural framework for such a cooperation. The respective sentient object controlling the actuation of the robot receives as input the position and orientation of the white line to be tracked. In the case of the guide robot, this information is directly delivered as a body event with a low latency and a high reliability over the internal network. For the follower robot, the information comes also via an event channel but with different quality attributes. These quality attributes are reflected in the event channel description. The sentient object controlling the actuation of the follower is aware of the increased latency and higher probability of omission. 9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The paper addresses problems of building large distributed systems interacting with the physical environment and being composed from a huge number of smart components. We cannot assume that the network architecture in such a system is homogeneous. Rather multiple edge- networks are fused to a hierarchical, heterogeneous wide area network. They connect the tiny sensors and actuators perceiving the environment and providing sentience to the application. Additionally, mobility and dynamic deployment of components require the dynamic interaction without fixed, a priori known addressing and routing schemes. The work presented in the paper is a contribution towards the seamless interaction in such an environment which should not be restricted by technical obstacles. Rather it should be possible to control the flow of information by explicitly specifying functional and temporal dissemination constraints. The paper presented the general model of a sentient object to describe composition, encapsulation and interaction in such an environment and developed the Generic Event Architecture GEAR which integrates the interaction through the environment and the network. While appropriate abstractions and interaction models can hide the functional heterogeneity of the networks, it is impossible to hide the quality differences. Therefore, one of the main concerns is to define temporal properties in such an open infrastructure. The notion of an event channel has been introduced which allows to specify quality aspects explicitly. They can be verified at subscription and define a boundary for event dissemination. The COSMIC middleware is a first attempt to put these concepts into operation. COSMIC allows the interoperability of tiny components over multiple network boundaries and supports the definition of different real-time event channel classes. There are many open questions that emerged from our work. One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain. Additionally, the provision of timing failure detection for the adaptation of interactions will be in the focus of our research. To reduce network traffic and only disseminate those events to the subscribers which they are really interested in and which have a chance to arrive timely, the encapsulation and scoping schemes have to be transformed into respective multi-level filtering rules. The event attributes which describe aspects of the context and temporal constraints for the dissemination will be exploited for this purpose. Finally, it is intended to integrate the results in the COSMIC middleware to enable experimental assessment. 38 10. REFERENCES [1] J. Bacon, K. Moody, J. Bates, R. Hayton, C. Ma, A. McNeil, O.

Introducción En los últimos años, hemos visto la mejora continua de las tecnologías que son relevantes para la construcción de sistemas integrados distribuidos, incluidos la sensación de confianza, auditiva y de ubicación confiable [11], comunicación y procesamiento. Creemos que en un mundo físico en red en red surgirá una nueva clase de aplicaciones, compuesta por una miríada de sensores y actuadores inteligentes para evaluar y controlar aspectos de sus entornos y actuar autónomos en respuesta a ello. Las características desafiantes anticipadas de estas aplicaciones incluyen autonomía, capacidad de respuesta y criticidad de seguridad, gran escala, dispersión geográfica, movilidad y evolución. Para enfrentar estos desafíos, es de importancia fundamental utilizar modelos, abstracciones y paradigmas de interacción de alto nivel adecuados. Desafortunadamente, cuando se enfrenta a las características específicas de los sistemas objetivo, las deficiencias de las arquitecturas actuales y los paradigmas de interacción de middleware se hacen evidentes. Mirando a los bloques de construcción básicos de tales sistemas, podemos encontrar componentes que comprenden piezas mecánicas, hardware, software y una interfaz de red. Sin embargo, los modelos clásicos de eventos/objetos suelen estar orientados al software y, como tal, cuando Trans28 se transfiere a una configuración de sistemas integrados en tiempo real, su armonía está abarrotada por el conflicto entre, por un lado, enviar/recibir eventos de software (basado en mensajes), y por otro lado, entrada/salida de hardware o eventos del mundo real, basados en registros. En términos de paradigmas de interacción, y aunque el uso de modelos basados en eventos parece ser una solución conveniente [10, 22], a menudo carecen del soporte apropiado para requisitos no funcionales como confiabilidad, puntualidad o seguridad. Este documento describe un marco arquitectónico y un middleware, que admite un sistema basado en componentes y una visión integrada sobre la comunicación basada en eventos que comprende los eventos del mundo real y los eventos generados en el sistema. Al elegir el paradigma de interacción apropiado, es de importancia fundamental abordar los problemas desafiantes de las solicitudes sensibles previstas. A diferencia de los enfoques clásicos que limitan las posibles interacciones a los límites de la aplicación, es decir, a sus componentes, consideramos que el entorno que rodea la aplicación también juega un papel relevante a este respecto. Por lo tanto, el documento comienza aclarando varios problemas relacionados con nuestra visión del sistema, sobre las interacciones que pueden tener lugar y sobre los flujos de información. Esta vista se complementa al proporcionar un esquema de la construcción del sistema basada en componentes y, en particular, al demostrar que es posible componer aplicaciones más grandes a partir de componentes básicos, siguiendo un enfoque de composición jerárquica. Esto proporciona los antecedentes necesarios para introducir la arquitectura de eventos genéricos (Gear), que describe la interacción basada en eventos entre los componentes a través de una capa de evento genérico al tiempo que permite la integración perfecta de los flujos de información física e informática. De hecho, la capa de evento genérico oculta los diferentes canales de comunicación, incluidas las interacciones a través del entorno. Además, la abstracción de la capa de eventos también es adecuada para el manejo adecuado de los requisitos no funcionales, a saber, la confiabilidad y la puntualidad, que son particularmente estrictas en los entornos en tiempo real. El documento dedica especial atención a este problema al discutir los aspectos temporales de las interacciones y las necesidades de previsibilidad. Se presenta un middleware apropiado que refleja estas necesidades y permite especificar eventos que tienen atributos de calidad para expresar restricciones temporales. Esto se complementa con la noción de canales de eventos (CE), que son abstracciones de la red subyacente mientras la capa de eventos abstrae. De hecho, los canales de eventos juegan un papel fundamental en la obtención de las propiedades funcionales y no funcionales (por ejemplo, confiabilidad y puntualidad) de las aplicaciones previstas, es decir, para permitir la aplicación de los atributos de calidad. Se establecen antes de la interacción para reservar los recursos computacionales y de red necesarios para la difusión de eventos altamente predecible. El papel está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 3 presentamos las nociones y abstracciones fundamentales que adoptamos en este trabajo para describir las interacciones que tienen lugar en el sistema. Luego, en la Sección 4, describimos el enfoque basado en componentes que permite la composición de objetos. El equipo se describe luego en la Sección 5 y la Sección 6 se centra en aspectos temporales de las interacciones. La Sección 7 describe el middleware cósmico, que puede usarse para especificar la interacción entre objetos sensibles. Un ejemplo simple para resaltar las ideas presentadas en el documento aparece en la Sección 8 y la Sección 9 concluye el documento.2. Trabajo relacionado Nuestro trabajo considera un mundo físico cableado en el que cooperan una gran cantidad de componentes autónomos. Está inspirado en muchos esfuerzos de investigación en áreas muy diferentes. Se han introducido sistemas basados en eventos en general para cumplir con los requisitos de las aplicaciones en las que las entidades generan información y la difunden [1, 25, 22]. Destinados a sistemas grandes y que requieren infraestructuras bastante complejas, estos sistemas de eventos no consideran aspectos de calidad estrictos como la puntualidad y los problemas de confiabilidad. En segundo lugar, no se crean para apoyar la interoperabilidad entre pequeños dispositivos inteligentes con limitaciones sustanciales de recursos. En [10] se ha introducido un sistema de eventos en tiempo real para Corba. Los eventos se enrutan a través de un servidor de eventos centrales que proporciona funciones de programación para admitir los requisitos en tiempo real. Tal componente central no está disponible en una infraestructura prevista en la arquitectura de nuestro sistema y el Tao de middleware desarrollado (el orbe ACE) es bastante complejo e inadecuado para estar directamente integrado en dispositivos inteligentes. Hay esfuerzos para implementar CORBA para redes de control, adaptadas para conectar los componentes del sensor y el actuador [15, 19]. Están dirigidos al bus CAN [9], una red popular desarrollada para la industria automotriz. Sin embargo, en estos enfoques, el apoyo a los problemas de puntualidad o confiabilidad no existe o solo es muy limitado. Se propone un nuevo esquema para integrar dispositivos inteligentes en un entorno CORBA en [17] y ha llevado a la propuesta de un estándar por parte del grupo de gestión de objetos (OMG) [26]. Los transductores inteligentes están organizados en grupos que están conectados a un sistema CORBA por una puerta de enlace. Los grupos forman subredes aislados. Un nodo maestro especial impone las propiedades temporales en la subred de clúster. Una puerta de enlace de Corba permite acceder a los datos del sensor y escribir datos del actuador mediante un sistema de archivos de interfaz (IFS). La estructura básica es similar a la estructura WAN de CANS que se ha introducido en el Proyecto Cortex [4]. Las islas de control estricto pueden ser realizados por una red de control y cooperar a través de redes cableadas o inalámbricas que cubren una gran cantidad de estas subredes. Sin embargo, en contraste con el modelo de canal de eventos introducido en este documento, toda la comunicación dentro de un clúster se basa en una sola solución técnica de un canal de comunicación sincrónica. En segundo lugar, aunque el comportamiento temporal de un solo clúster está rigurosamente definido, no se proporciona ningún modelo para especificar propiedades temporales para las interacciones ClusterTo-Corba o Cluster-to Cluster.3. Flujo de información y modelo de interacción En este documento consideramos un modelo de sistema basado en componentes que incorpora trabajos previos desarrollados en el contexto del proyecto IST Cortex [5]. Como se mencionó anteriormente, una idea fundamental subyacente al enfoque es que las aplicaciones pueden estar compuestas por una gran cantidad de componentes inteligentes que pueden sentir su entorno circundante e interactuar con él. Estos componentes se denominan objetos sensibles, una metáfora elaborada en la corteza e inspirada en el concepto genérico de informática sensible introducida en [12]. Los objetos sintientes aceptan eventos de entrada de una variedad de fuentes diferentes (incluidos los sensores, pero no limitados a eso), procesanlos y producen eventos de salida, por lo que actúan sobre el entorno y/o interactúan con otros objetos. Por lo tanto, los siguientes tipos de interacciones pueden tener lugar en el sistema: interacciones de entorno a objeto: corresponden a un flujo de información del entorno a los objetos de aplicación, informando sobre el estado de la primera y/o notificación sobre los eventos que tienen lugaren esto. Interacciones de objeto a objeto: corresponde a un flujo de información entre objetos sensibles, cumpliendo dos propósitos. El primero está relacionado con la complementación de la evaluación de cada objeto individual sobre el estado del espacio circundante. El segundo está relacionado con la colaboración, en el que el objeto intenta influir en otros objetos para que contribuyan a un objetivo común, o a reaccionar a una situación inesperada. Interacciones de objeto a ambiente: corresponde a un flujo de información de un objeto al entorno, con el propósito de forzar un cambio en el estado de este último. Antes de continuar, necesitamos aclarar algunos problemas con respecto a estas posibles formas de interacción. Consideramos que el entorno puede ser un productor o consumidor de información mientras interactúa con objetos sensibles. El entorno es el mundo real (físico) que rodea un objeto, no necesariamente cerca del objeto o limitado a ciertos límites. Claramente, la información producida por el entorno corresponde a la representación física de las entidades en tiempo real, de las cuales los ejemplos típicos incluyen temperatura, distancia o el estado de una puerta. Por otro lado, la actuación en el medio ambiente implica la manipulación de estas entidades en tiempo real, como aumentar la temperatura (aplicar más calor), cambiar la distancia (aplicando algún movimiento) o cambiar el estado de la puerta (cerrar o abrirla). Las transformaciones requeridas entre las representaciones del sistema de estas entidades en tiempo real y sus representaciones físicas se realizan, genéricamente, por sensores y actuadores. Además, consideramos que puede existir sensores y actuadores tontos, que interactúan con los objetos mediante la difusión o captura de la información del transductor sin procesar, y los sensores y actuadores inteligentes, con capacidades de procesamiento mejoradas, capaces de hablar un dialecto de eventos más elaborado (consulte las Secciones 5 y 6.1). Por lo tanto, la interacción con el entorno se realiza a través de sensores y actuadores, que pueden o no ser parte de objetos sensibles, como se discutió en la Sección 4.2. Los cambios de estado o estado en el medio ambiente se consideran eventos, capturados por sensores (en el entorno o dentro de los objetos sensibles) y se difunden aún más a otros objetos sensibles potencialmente interesados en el sistema. En consecuencia, es bastante natural basar la comunicación y la interacción entre los objetos sensibles y con el medio ambiente en un modelo de comunicación basado en eventos. Además, las propiedades típicas de los modelos basados en eventos, como la comunicación anónima y no bloqueada, son altamente deseables en los sistemas donde los objetos sensibles pueden ser móviles y donde las interacciones son naturalmente muy dinámicas. Un aspecto distintivo de nuestro trabajo de muchos de los enfoques existentes es que consideramos que los objetos sintientes pueden comunicarse indirectamente entre sí a través del medio ambiente, cuando actúan en consecuencia. Por lo tanto, el entorno constituye un canal de interacción y comunicación y está en el bucle de control y conciencia de los objetos. En otras palabras, cuando un objeto sensible actúe en el entorno, podrá observar los cambios de estado en el entorno mediante eventos capturados por los sensores. Claramente, otros objetos también podrían capturar los mismos eventos, estableciendo así la ruta de comunicación indirecta mencionada anteriormente. En los sistemas que involucran interacciones con el entorno, es muy importante considerar la posibilidad de comunicación a través del medio ambiente. Se ha demostrado que los canales ocultos que se desarrollan a través de este último (por ejemplo, bucles de retroalimentación) pueden obstaculizar los algoritmos basados en software que los ignoran [30]. Por lo tanto, cualquier solución al problema requiere la definición de abstracciones convenientes y construcciones arquitectónicas apropiadas. Por otro lado, para lidiar con el flujo de información a través de todo el sistema informático y el entorno de una manera perfecta, manejando un software y eventos de hardware de manera uniforme, también es necesario encontrar abstracciones adecuadas. Como se discutió en la Sección 5, la arquitectura de eventos genéricos introduce el concepto de evento genérico y una abstracción de la capa de eventos que tiene como objetivo tratar, entre otros, con estos problemas.4. Composición de objetos sensibles En esta sección, analizamos los problemas más relevantes relacionados con el paradigma de los objetos sintientes y la construcción de sistemas compuestos por objetos sensibles.4.1 Construcción del sistema basado en componentes Los objetos sensibles pueden tomar varias formas diferentes: simplemente pueden ser componentes basados en software, pero también pueden comprender piezas mecánicas y/o de hardware, entre las cuales el aparato muy sensorial que correge la sensibilidad, mezclados con los componentes de software.cumplir con su tarea. Refinamos esta noción considerando un objeto sensible como una entidad encapsulante, un componente con lógica interna y elementos de procesamiento activo, capaz de recibir, transformar y producir nuevos eventos. Esta interfaz oculta la estructura interna de hardware/software del objeto, que puede ser compleja, y protege el sistema de los detalles funcionales y temporales de bajo nivel de controlar un sensor o actuador específico. Además, dada la complejidad inherente de las aplicaciones previstas, el número de eventos de entrada simultáneos y el tamaño interno de los objetos sensibles pueden volverse demasiado grandes y difíciles de manejar. Por lo tanto, debería ser posible considerar la composición jerárquica de objetos sensibles para que la lógica de la aplicación pueda separarse en tan pocos o tantos objetos como sea necesario. Por otro lado, la composición de objetos sensibles normalmente debe estar limitado por la estructura de componentes de hardware real, evitando la posibilidad de componer arbitrariamente objetos sensibles. Esto se ilustra en la Figura 1, donde un objeto sensible se compone internamente de algunos otros objetos sensibles, cada uno de ellos consumiendo y produciendo eventos, algunos de los cuales solo se propagaron internamente. Observando la figura y recordando nuestra discusión anterior sobre las posibles interacciones, identificamos todas ellas aquí: una interacción de objeto a ambiente ocurre entre el objeto que controla un transmisor WLAN y algún receptor WLAN en el entorno;Una interacción de entorno a objeto tiene lugar cuando el objeto responsable del GPS 30 G P S R E C E P T I O N W I R E L E S S T R A N S M I S S I O N D O P P P L E R R A D A R P H Y S I C A L F E E E D B A C K O B J E C T T S B O D Y I N T E R N A L N E T W O R K FIGURA 1: COMPONELE.La recepción de la señal utiliza la información transmitida por los satélites;Finalmente, las interacciones explícitas del objeto al objeto ocurren internamente en el objeto del contenedor, a través de una red de comunicación interna. Además, es interesante observar que también puede ocurrir una comunicación implícita, si la retroalimentación física se desarrolla a través del entorno interno al objeto del contenedor (como se muestra) o a través del entorno externo a este objeto. Sin embargo, hay una diferencia sutil entre ambos casos. Mientras que en el primero, la retroalimentación solo puede ser percibida por objetos internos del contenedor, limitando la medida en que se debe garantizar la consistencia, tales límites no existen en el último. De hecho, la noción de objeto sintiente como entidad encapsulante puede cumplir con otros fines (por ejemplo, el confinamiento de la retroalimentación y la propagación de los eventos), más allá de la mera composición jerárquica de los objetos. Para dar un ejemplo más concreto de dicha composición del objeto consciente de los componentes, consideramos un escenario de robots cooperantes. Cada robot está hecho de varios componentes, correspondientes, por ejemplo, a los controladores de eje y manipulador. Junto con el software de control, cada uno de estos controladores puede ser un objeto sensible. Por otro lado, un robot en sí es un objeto sensible, compuesto por los objetos materializados por los controladores, y el entorno interno a su propia estructura o cuerpo. Esto significa que debería ser posible definir actividades de cooperación utilizando los eventos producidos por los objetos sensibles de los robots, sin la necesidad de conocer la estructura interna de los robots, o los eventos producidos por los objetos del cuerpo o por sensores inteligentes dentro del cuerpo. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista de la ingeniería, esto también significa que el objeto sensible del robot puede tener que generar nuevos eventos que reflejen su estado interno, lo que requiere la definición de una puerta de enlace para hacer el puente entre los entornos internos y externos.4.2 Encapsulación y alcance Ahora una pregunta importante es sobre cómo representar y difundir eventos en un mundo en red a gran escala. Como hemos visto anteriormente, cualquier evento generado por un objeto sensible podría, en principio, ser visible en cualquier parte del sistema y, por lo tanto, recibido por cualquier otro objeto sensible. Sin embargo, existen obstáculos sustanciales para tales interacciones universales, que se originan en la heterogeneidad de los componentes en tal entorno a gran escala. En primer lugar, los componentes pueden tener restricciones de rendimiento severas, particularmente porque queremos integrar sensores y actuadores inteligentes en dicha arquitectura. En segundo lugar, el ancho de banda de las redes participantes puede variar en gran medida. Dichas redes pueden ser de baja potencia, negocios de campo de bajo ancho de banda o redes inalámbricas más potentes, así como columnas de alta velocidad. En tercer lugar, las redes pueden tener características de confiabilidad y puntualidad muy diferentes. Considere un pelotón de vehículos cooperantes. Dentro de un vehículo puede haber un bus de campo como CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] o LIN [20], con un ancho de banda relativamente bajo. Por otro lado, los vehículos se comunican con otros en el pelotón a través de un enlace inalámbrico directo. Finalmente, puede haber múltiples pelotones de vehículos que están coordinados por una capa de red inalámbrica adicional. En el nivel de abstracción de objetos sensibles, dicha heterogeneidad se refleja por la noción de cuerpo-ambiente. En el nivel de red, asumimos que la estructura WAN-of-CANS [27] modela las diferentes redes. La noción de cuerpo y entorno se deriva del modelo de objetos basado en componentes recursivamente definidos. Un cuerpo es similar a una membrana celular y representa un contenedor de calidad de servicio para los objetos sensibles en el interior. En el nivel de red, puede estar asociado con los componentes acoplados por cierto CAN. A CAN define la calidad de difusión que los objetos cooperantes pueden esperar. En el ejemplo anterior, un vehículo puede ser un objeto sensible, cuyo cuerpo está compuesto por los respectivos objetos de nivel inferior (sensores y actuadores) que están conectados por la red interna (ver Figura 1). En consecuencia, el pelotón puede verse a sí mismo como un objeto compuesto por una colección de vehículos cooperantes, siendo su cuerpo el entorno encapsulado por la zona de pelotón. En el nivel de red, la red inalámbrica representa la lata respectiva. Sin embargo, varios pelotones unidos por sus latas pueden interactuar entre sí y objetos más lejos, a través de un sustrato de red fijo de rango más amplio, posible, de ahí el concepto de WAN-of-CANS. Las nociones de ambiente corporal y WAN de CAN son muy útiles al definir las propiedades de interacción a través de tales límites. Su introducción obedeció a nuestra creencia de que un solo mecanismo para proporcionar medidas de calidad para las interacciones no es apropiada. En cambio, se necesita una construcción de alto nivel para la interacción entre los límites que permite especificar la calidad de la difusión y explotar el conocimiento sobre el cuerpo y el medio ambiente para evaluar la viabilidad de las limitaciones de calidad. Como veremos en la siguiente sección, la noción de un canal de eventos representa esta construcción en nuestra arquitectura. Difusión de eventos y permite la especificación independiente de la red de atributos de calidad. Estos atributos deben asignarse a las propiedades respectivas de la estructura de red subyacente.5. Una arquitectura de eventos genéricos Para aplicar con éxito modelos orientados a objetos basados en eventos, que aborda los desafíos enumerados en la introducción de este documento, es necesario utilizar construcciones arquitectónicas adecuadas que permitan la aplicación de propiedades fundamentales como la oportunidad o la confiabilidad. Proponemos la arquitectura de eventos genéricos (Gear), representados en la Figura 2, que describimos brevemente en lo que sigue (para una descripción más detallada, consulte [29]). La estructura en forma de L es crucial para garantizar algunas de las propiedades descritas. Medio ambiente: el entorno físico, remoto y cercano, sólido y eterial, de objetos sensibles.31 c o m m sc o m m sc o m m s t r a n s l a t i o n l a y e r t r a n s l a t i o n l a y e r b o d y e n v i r o n m e n t b o d y e n v i r o n m e n t b o d y e n v i r o n m e n t (i n c l u d i n g o p e r a r a n o n o n o o o o o o o n o n o o o o o o o o o o n n) j e c t o r o b j e c t c o m p o u n d) t r a n s l a t i o n l a y e r t r a n s l a t i o n s e n t i e n t o b j e c t s e n t i e n t o b j e c t se n t i e n t o b j e c t r e g u l a r n e t w o r k c o n s u m ep r o d u c e e v e n t l a y e r e v e n t l a y e r e v e n t l a y e r s e n t i e n t o b j e c t th figura 2: arquitectura de evaluación de genics. Cuerpo: la realización física de un objeto sensible (por ejemplo, el hardware donde reside un controlador mecatrónico, la estructura física de un automóvil). Tenga en cuenta que debido al enfoque compositivo adoptado en nuestro modelo, parte de lo que es entorno a un objeto más pequeño visto individualmente, se convierte en cuerpo para un objeto que contiene más grande. De hecho, el cuerpo es el entorno interno del objeto. Esta capas de arquitectura permite que la composición tenga lugar sin problemas, en lo que se refiere al flujo de información. Dentro de un cuerpo también puede haber un conocimiento implícito, que puede explotarse para hacer que la interacción sea más eficiente, como el conocimiento sobre el número de entidades cooperantes, la existencia de una red de comunicación específica o el hecho simple de que todos los componentes están ubicados y, por lo tanto,Los eventos respectivos no necesitan especificar la ubicación en sus atributos de contexto. Dicha información intrínseca no está disponible fuera de un cuerpo y, por lo tanto, una información más explícita debe ser llevada por un evento. Capa de traducción: la capa responsable de la transformación de eventos físicos de/a su forma nativa al dialecto del canal de eventos, entre el entorno/cuerpo y un canal de eventos. Esencialmente, uno que realiza operaciones de observación y actuación en el lado inferior, y realiza transacciones de descripciones de eventos en el otro. En el lado inferior, esta capa también puede interactuar con sensores de tontos o actuadores, por lo tanto, hablar el lenguaje del dispositivo específico. Estas interacciones se realizan a través de redes operativas (de ahí el símbolo de la antena en la figura). Capa de eventos: la capa responsable de la propagación de eventos en todo el sistema, a través de varios canales de eventos (EC):. En términos concretos, esta capa es un tipo de middleware que proporciona importantes servicios de procesamiento de eventos que son cruciales para cualquier sistema realista basado en eventos. Por ejemplo, algunos de los servicios que implican el procesamiento de eventos pueden incluir publicar, suscribirse, discriminación (zonificación, filtrado, fusión, rastreo) y cola. Capa de comunicación: la capa responsable de envolver eventos (de hecho, descripciones de eventos en el dialecto EC) en mensajes de eventos de transporte, que se transportará a lugares remotos. Por ejemplo, un evento de detección generado por un sensor inteligente está envuelto en un mensaje de evento y difundido, para ser atrapado por quien esté preocupado. Lo mismo se mantiene para un evento de actuación producido por un objeto sensible, para ser entregado a un actuador inteligente remoto. Del mismo modo, esto puede aplicarse a un mensaje de eventos de un objeto sensible a otro. Los sensores tontos y los actuadores no envían mensajes de eventos, ya que no pueden comprender el dialecto EC (no tienen una capa de eventos ni una capa de comunicación: se comunican, si es necesario, a través de redes operativas). Red regular: esto se representa en el eje horizontal del diagrama de bloques por la capa de comunicación, que abarca los protocolos habituales de LAN, TCP/IP y tiempo real, aumentados deseablemente con transmisión confiable y/u ordenada y otros protocolos. El Gear presenta algunas ideas innovadoras en la arquitectura de sistemas distribuidos. Mientras sirve un modelo de objetos basado en la producción y el consumo de eventos genéricos, trata los eventos producidos por varias fuentes (medio ambiente, cuerpo, objetos) de manera homogénea. Esto es posible debido al uso de un dialecto básico común para hablar de eventos y debido a la existencia de la capa de traducción, que realiza la traducción necesaria entre la representación física de una entidad en tiempo real y el formato compatible con la CE. Crucial a la arquitectura es la capa de eventos, que utiliza canales de eventos para propagar eventos a través de infraestructuras de red regulares. La capa de eventos se realiza por el middleware cósmico, como se describe en la Sección 7. 5.1 Flujo de información En marcha El flujo de información (entorno externo y parte computacional) es compatible con la arquitectura en forma de L. Ocurre de diferentes maneras, lo que demuestra la expresividad del modelo con respecto a las formas necesarias de información encontradas en los sistemas cooperativos e integrados en tiempo real. Los sensores inteligentes producen eventos que informan sobre el entorno. Los sensores corporales producen eventos que informan sobre el cuerpo. Se diseminan por el módulo de capa de eventos local, en un canal de eventos (EC) propagado a través de la red regular, a cualquier módulo de capa de eventos remoto relevante donde las entidades mostraban un interés en ellos, normalmente, objetos sensibles adjuntos a los respectivos módulos de eventos locales de eventos locales.. Los objetos sintientes consumen eventos que están interesados, los procesan y producen otros eventos. Algunos de estos eventos están destinados a otros objetos sensibles. Se publican en una CE utilizando el mismo dialecto EC que sirve, por ejemplo, eventos originados por el sensor. Sin embargo, estos eventos son semánticamente de un tipo de tal manera que deben ser suscritos por los objetos sensibles relevantes, por ejemplo, los objetos sensibles que componen un sistema de controlador de robot o, en un nivel superior, los objetos sensibles que componen los robots reales en 32una aplicación cooperativa. Los actuadores inteligentes, por otro lado, simplemente consumen eventos producidos por objetos sensibles, por los cuales aceptan y ejecutan comandos de actuación. Alternativamente, para hablar con otros objetos sensibles, los objetos sensibles pueden producir eventos de un nivel inferior, por ejemplo, comandos de actuación en el cuerpo o el entorno. Publican estos exactamente de la misma manera: en un canal de eventos a través del representante local de la capa de eventos. Ahora, si estos comandos son preocupantes para las unidades de actuador local (por ejemplo, cuerpo, incluidas las redes operativas internas), se transmiten a la capa de traducción local. Si son preocupantes para un actuador inteligente remoto, se difunden a través de la capa de eventos distribuidos, para llegar a la primera. En cualquier caso, si también son de interés para otras entidades, como otros objetos sensibles que desean ser informados del comando de actuación, también se diseminan a través de la CE a estos objetos sensibles. Una ventaja clave de esta arquitectura es que los mensajes de eventos y los eventos físicos se pueden ordenar a nivel mundial, si es necesario, ya que todos pasan por la capa de eventos. El modelo también ofrece oportunidades para resolver un problema duradero en tiempo real, control de la computadora y sistemas integrados: la inconsistencia entre los subsistemas de flujo de información del bucle de mensajes de retroalimentación.6. Aspectos temporales de las interacciones Cualquier interacción necesita alguna forma de previsibilidad. Si se consideran escenarios críticos de seguridad como se realiza en la corteza, los aspectos temporales se vuelven cruciales y deben hacerse explícitos. El problema es cómo definir restricciones temporales y cómo hacerlas cumplir con el uso apropiado de recursos en un entorno ad-hoc dinámico. En un sistema donde las interacciones son espontáneas, también puede ser necesario determinar dinámicamente las propiedades temporales. Para hacer esto, la información temporal respectiva debe establecerse explícitamente y disponible durante el tiempo de ejecución. En segundo lugar, no siempre se asegura que se puedan cumplir las propiedades temporales. En estos casos, se deben proporcionar adaptaciones y notificación de falla de tiempo [2, 28]. En la mayoría de los sistemas en tiempo real, la noción de una fecha límite es el esquema predominante para expresar y hacer cumplir la puntualidad. Sin embargo, una fecha límite solo refleja débilmente las características temporales de la información que se maneja. En segundo lugar, una fecha límite a menudo incluye conocimiento implícito sobre el sistema y las relaciones entre las actividades. En un entorno cerrado bastante bien definido, es posible hacer tales suposiciones implícitas y asignarlos a los tiempos de ejecución y los plazos. P.ej.El ingeniero sabe cuánto tiempo se puede usar una posición de vehículo antes de que el movimiento del vehículo se desanime con esta información. Por lo tanto, mapea esta dependencia entre la velocidad y la posición en una fecha límite que luego asegura que se suponga que el error de posición está limitado. En un entorno abierto, este mapeo implícito ya no es posible porque, como una razón obvia, la relación entre la velocidad y la posición, y por lo tanto el error, el error, no puede ser fácilmente diseñado a reverso desde una fecha límite. Por lo tanto, nuestro modelo de evento incluye atributos de calidad explícitos que permiten especificar los atributos temporales para cada evento individual. Esto es, por supuesto, una sobrecarga en comparación con el uso del conocimiento implícito, pero en un entorno dinámico se necesita dicha información. Para ilustrar el problema, considere el ejemplo de la posición de un vehículo. Una posición es un ejemplo típico para el tiempo, la entidad de valor [30]. Por lo tanto, la posición es útil si podemos determinar un límite de error que está relacionado con el tiempo, p.Si queremos un error de posición por debajo de 10 metros para establecer una propiedad de seguridad entre los automóviles cooperantes que se mueven con 5 m/seg, la posición tiene un tiempo de validez de 2 segundos. En una entidad de entidad de valor, podemos intercambiar el tiempo con la precisión del valor. Esto se conoce como valor en el tiempo y el tiempo sobre el valor [18]. Una vez que haya establecido la relación de valor en el tiempo y capturado en los atributos del evento, los suscriptores de este evento pueden decidir localmente sobre la utilidad de una información. En la arquitectura de Gear Architecture, la validez temporal se utiliza para razonar sobre las propiedades de seguridad en un sistema basado en eventos [29]. Revisaremos brevemente las nociones respectivas y veremos cómo se explotan en nuestro middleware de evento cósmico. Considere la línea de tiempo de generar un evento que representa una entidad en tiempo real [18] desde su ocurrencia hasta la notificación de un cierto objeto sensible (Figura 3). La entidad en tiempo real se captura en la interfaz del sensor del sistema y debe transformarse en una forma que pueda ser tratada por una computadora. Durante el intervalo de tiempo T0, el sensor lee la entidad en tiempo real y una marca de tiempo se asocia con el valor respectivo. El tiempo derivado, la entidad de valor representa una observación. Puede ser necesario realizar cálculos locales sustanciales para obtener información relevante de la aplicación de los datos del sensor sin procesar. Sin embargo, debe tenerse en cuenta que la marca de tiempo de la observación está asociada con el tiempo de captura y, por lo tanto, independiente del procesamiento de señales y la generación de eventos. Esta estrecha relación entre el tiempo de captura y el valor asociado es compatible con los sensores inteligentes descritos anteriormente. La información del sensor procesada se ensambla en una estructura de datos de eventos después de que TS se publique en un canal de eventos. Como se describe más adelante, el evento incluye la marca de tiempo de generación y la validez temporal como atributos. La validez temporal es una medida definida por la aplicación para la expiración de un valor, valor. Como explicamos en el ejemplo de una posición anterior, puede variar dependiendo de los parámetros de aplicación. La validez temporal es un concepto más general que el de una fecha límite. Es independiente de una cierta implementación técnica de un sistema. Si bien los plazos pueden usarse para programar los pasos respectivos en una generación y difusión de eventos, una validez temporal es una propiedad intrínseca de una entidad de valor de tiempo transportada en un evento. Una validez temporal permite razonar sobre la utilidad de la información y es beneficioso incluso en sistemas en los que no se puede aplicar la difusión oportuna de los eventos porque permite la detección de fallas de tiempo en el consumidor del evento. Es obvio que los plazos o períodos pueden derivarse de la validez temporal de un evento. Es necesario establecer una fecha límite, el conocimiento de una implementación, los peores tiempos de ejecución de los casos o las latencias de difusión de mensajes. Por lo tanto, en la línea de tiempo de la Figura 3, cada intervalo puede tener una fecha límite. Difusión de eventos a través de canales suaves en tiempo real en explotación cósmica de la validez temporal para definir los plazos de difusión. Los atributos de calidad se pueden definir, por ejemplo, en términos de intervalo de validez, pares de grado de omisión. Estos permiten caracterizar la utilidad del evento para una determinada aplicación, en un determinado contexto. Debido a eso, los atributos de calidad de un evento dependen claramente de problemas de nivel superior, como la naturaleza del objeto sensible o del sensor inteligente que produjo el evento. Por ejemplo, un evento que contiene una indicación de alguna velocidad del vehículo debe tener atributos de calidad diferentes dependiendo del tipo de observación del evento del mundo real: <Sello de tiempo> Valor> Evento generado listo para ser transmitido Notificación de evento recibido, a T Productor de eventoscommunication network event consumer event channel push <event> , ts , tm , tt , tn , t o : t i m e t o o b t a i n a n o b s e r v a t i o n , t s : t i m e t o p r o c e s s s e n s o r r e a d i n g , t m : t i m e t o a s s e m b l e a n e v e n t m e s s a g e , t t : t i m e t o t r a n s f e r t h e e v e n t o n t h e r e g u l a r n e t w o r k , t n : t i m e f o r n o t i f i c a t i o n o n t h e c o n s u m e r s i t e Figure 3: Event processing and dissemination.desde el cual se originó, o dependiendo de su velocidad actual. Lo mismo ocurre con el evento de posición del ejemplo del automóvil anterior, cuya validez depende de la velocidad actual y de una precisión previamente requerida. Sin embargo, dado que los atributos de calidad están estrictamente relacionados con la semántica de la aplicación o, al menos, con algún conocimiento de alto nivel del propósito del sistema (a partir del cual se puede derivar la validez de la información), la definición de estos atributos de calidad puedehacerse explotando la información proporcionada en la interfaz de programación. Por lo tanto, es importante comprender cómo el programador del sistema puede especificar requisitos no funcionales en la API y cómo estos requisitos se traducen en atributos de calidad asignados a los eventos. Si bien la validez temporal se identifica como una propiedad de eventos intrínsecos, que se explota para decidir sobre la utilidad de los datos en un cierto momento, todavía es necesario proporcionar una instalación de comunicación que pueda difundir el evento antes de que la validez expire. En una estructura de red WAN-of-CANS tenemos que hacer frente a las características de la red muy diferentes y la calidad de las propiedades de servicio. Por lo tanto, al cruzar los límites de la red, se perderán las garantías de calidad de servicio disponibles en una determinada red y será muy difícil, costoso y quizás imposible lograr estas propiedades en la siguiente área más grande de la estructura WAN-de Cails. Cortex tiene un par de abstracciones para hacer frente a esta situación (zonas de red, cuerpo/entorno) que se han discutido anteriormente. Desde el punto de vista temporal, necesitamos una abstracción de alto nivel como la validez temporal para el evento individual ahora para expresar nuestros requisitos de calidad de la difusión sobre la red. El par de cobertura límite, introducido en relación con el TCB [28] parece ser un enfoque apropiado. Considera la incertidumbre inherente de las redes y permite intercambiar la calidad de la difusión contra los recursos necesarios. En relación con el modelo de canal de eventos discutido más adelante, el par de cobertura límite permite especificar las propiedades de calidad de un canal de eventos independientemente de problemas técnicos específicos. Dados los entornos típicos en los que operarán las aplicaciones sensibles, donde es difícil o incluso imposible proporcionar garantías de puntualidad o confiabilidad, propusimos una forma alternativa de manejar los requisitos de aplicación no funcionales, en relación con el enfoque TCB [28]. El enfoque propuesto explota las características intrínsecas de las aplicaciones, como la seguridad fallida o la elasticidad del tiempo, para asegurar las especificaciones de QoS de la cobertura de forma unida. En lugar de construir sistemas que se basan en límites garantizados, la idea es usar (posiblemente cambiando) límites que están asegurados con una probabilidad constante en toda la ejecución. Obviamente, esto requiere una aplicación para poder adaptarse a las condiciones cambiantes (y/o los límites cambiantes) o, si esto no es posible, para poder realizar algunos procedimientos de seguridad cuando las condiciones operativas se degradan a un nivel insoportable. Los límites que mencionamos anteriormente se refieren esencialmente a los límites de la puntualidad asociados a la ejecución de actividades locales o distribuidas, o combinaciones de los mismos. De estos límites es posible derivar los atributos de calidad, en particular los intervalos de validez que caracterizan los eventos publicados en el canal de eventos.6.1 El papel de los sensores y actuadores inteligentes de los dispositivos inteligentes encapsulan el hardware, el software y los componentes mecánicos y proporcionan información y un conjunto de funciones bien especificadas y que están estrechamente relacionadas con la interacción con el entorno. Los componentes computacionales incorporados y la interfaz de red permiten la implementación de una interfaz de alto nivel bien definida que no solo proporciona datos de transductor sin procesar, sino un conjunto de eventos procesados y relacionados con la aplicación. Además, exhiben un comportamiento espontáneo autónomo. Se diferencian de los nodos de propósito general porque están dedicados a una determinada funcionalidad que cumple con sus capacidades de detección y actuación, mientras que el nodo de propósito general puede ejecutar cualquier programa. Con respecto al modelo de objetos sintientes, los sensores y actuadores inteligentes pueden ser objetos sensibles básicos en sí mismos, consumiendo eventos del entorno del mundo real y produciendo los eventos genéricos respectivos para la capa de eventos de sistemas o 34 viceversa que consumen un evento genérico y la convierte en unEvento del mundo real por una actuación. Por lo tanto, los componentes inteligentes constituyen la periferia, es decir, la interfaz del mundo real de un objeto sensible más complejo. El modelo de objetos sensibles también constituye el marco para construir sensores virtuales más complejos al relacionar múltiples sensores (es decir, sensores que detectan directamente una entidad física) sensores. Los componentes inteligentes traducen eventos del entorno a una forma apropiada disponible en la capa de eventos o, viceversa, transforman un evento del sistema en una actuación. Para los componentes inteligentes podemos suponer que: • Los componentes inteligentes tienen recursos dedicados para realizar una función específica.• Estos recursos no se utilizan para otros fines durante la operación normal en tiempo real.• No se producen conflictos temporales locales que cambiarán el comportamiento temporal observable.• Las funciones de un componente generalmente solo se pueden cambiar durante un procedimiento de configuración que no se realiza cuando el componente está involucrado en operaciones críticas.• Una observación del entorno como un par, se puede obtener un par de valor con una jitter acotada en el tiempo. Muchos problemas de previsibilidad y programación surgen del hecho de que los comportamientos de tiempo de muy bajo nivel deben manejarse en un solo procesador. Aquí, la encapsulación temporal de las actividades es difícil debido a los posibles efectos secundarios al compartir un solo recurso de procesador. Considere el control de un detector de rango IR simple que se utiliza para evitar obstáculos. Dependiendo de su rango y la velocidad de un vehículo, debe ser encuestado para evitar que el vehículo se caiga en un obstáculo. En un solo procesador central, esta actividad crítica debe coordinarse con muchas funciones similares, posiblemente menos críticas. Significa que un horario de grano muy fino debe derivarse basándose exclusivamente en los artefactos del control del dispositivo de bajo nivel. En un componente de sensor inteligente, todo este comportamiento de tiempo de bajo nivel se puede optimizar y encapsularse. Por lo tanto, podemos asumir una encapsulación temporal similar a la información oculta en el dominio funcional. Por supuesto, todavía existe el problema que garantiza que los componentes del sistema respectivos se difundan y reconocerán un evento a su debido tiempo, pero esto se relaciona con eventos relacionados con la aplicación en lugar de los bajos artefactos de un momento de tiempo. La responsabilidad principal de proporcionar garantías de puntualidad se transfiere a la capa de eventos donde se difunden estos eventos. Los sensores inteligentes conducen al modelo de sistema centrado en la red. La red constituye el recurso compartido que debe programarse de manera predecible. El middleware cósmico introducido en la siguiente sección es un enfoque para proporcionar una difusión de eventos predecibles para una red de sensores y actuadores inteligentes.7. Un modelo de evento y Middleware para dispositivos inteligentes cooperantes Un modelo de evento y un middleware adecuado para componentes inteligentes deben admitir una comunicación oportuna y confiable y también debe ser eficiente en los recursos. Cosmic (dispositivos inteligentes cooperantes) tiene como objetivo apoyar la interacción entre esos componentes de acuerdo con los conceptos introducidos hasta ahora. Basado en el modelo de una WAN de CAN, suponemos que los componentes están conectados a alguna forma de CAN como un bus de campo o una red de sensores inalámbricos especiales que proporciona propiedades de red específicas. P.ej.Una bus de campo desarrollada para aplicaciones de control generalmente incluye mecanismos para la comunicación predecible, mientras que otras redes solo admiten la mejor difusión de esfuerzo. Una puerta de enlace conecta estas latas al siguiente nivel en la jerarquía de red. El sistema de eventos debe permitir la interacción dinámica sobre una jerarquía de tales redes y cumplir con el modelo general de eventos genéricos de la corteza. Los eventos son portadores de información escrita y se difunden en un estilo de editor/ suscriptor [24, 7], que es particularmente adecuado porque admite la comunicación generativa y anónima [3] y no crea dependencias de control artificiales entre los productores de información y los consumidores. Este desacoplamiento en el espacio (no se necesitan referencias ni nombres de remitentes o receptores para la comunicación) y el desacoplamiento de flujo (no se produce transferencia de control con una transferencia de datos) son bien conocidos [24, 7, 14] y propiedades cruciales para mantener la autonomía de los componentese interacciones dinámicas. Es obvio que no todas las redes pueden proporcionar las mismas garantías de QoS y, en segundo lugar, las aplicaciones pueden tener requisitos muy diferentes para la difusión de eventos. Además, cuando se esfuerza por la previsibilidad, los recursos deben reservarse y las estructuras de datos deben configurarse antes de que se realice la comunicación. Por lo tanto, estas cosas no se pueden hacer previsiblemente sobre la marcha mientras difunden un evento. Por lo tanto, introdujimos la noción de un canal de eventos para hacer frente a diferentes propiedades y requisitos y tenemos un objeto al que podemos asignar recursos y reservas. El concepto de un canal de eventos no es nuevo [10, 25], sin embargo, aún no se ha utilizado para reflejar las propiedades de las redes y mecanismos de comunicación heterogéneos subyacentes según lo descrito por la arquitectura de engranajes. Más bien, el evento de eventos existente permite especificar las prioridades o plazos de eventos manejados en un servidor de eventos. Los canales de eventos permiten especificar las propiedades de comunicación en el nivel del sistema de eventos de manera fina. Un canal de eventos se define por: canal de eventos: = sujeto, atributante de calidad, manejadores, el sujeto determina los tipos de eventos que se pueden emitir al canal. Los atributos de calidad modelan las propiedades de la red de comunicación subyacente y el esquema de difusión. Estos atributos incluyen especificaciones de latencia, restricciones de difusión y parámetros de confiabilidad. La noción de zonas que representan una calidad de servicio garantizada en una subred admite este enfoque. Nuestro objetivo es manejar las especificaciones temporales como unidos, pares de cobertura [28] ortogonales a las preguntas más técnicas sobre cómo lograr una cierta propiedad de sincronía de la infraestructura de difusión. Actualmente, apoyamos los atributos de calidad de los canales de eventos en un entorno Can-Bus representado por clases de sincronía explícitas. El middleware cósmico mapea las propiedades del canal a los protocolos de nivel inferior de la red regular. Basado en nuestro trabajo anterior sobre protocolos predecibles para el bus CAN, Cosmic define una red abstracta que proporciona clases de mensajes duros, suaves y no en tiempo real [21]. En consecuencia, distinguimos tres clases de canales de eventos de acuerdo con sus propiedades de sincronía: canales duros en tiempo real, canales suaves en tiempo real y canales no en tiempo real. Los canales duros en tiempo real (HRTC) garantizan la propagación del evento dentro de las limitaciones de tiempo definidas en presencia 35 de un número especificado de fallas de omisión. Los HRTEC están respaldados por un esquema de reserva que es similar al esquema utilizado en protocolos activados por el tiempo como TTP [16] [31], TTP/A [17] y TTCAN [8]. Sin embargo, una ventaja sustancial sobre un esquema TDMA es que debido a las propiedades del bus de canales, el ancho de banda que fue reservado pero que no es necesario por un HRTEC puede ser utilizado por un tráfico menos crítico [21]. Los canales suaves en tiempo real (SRTC) explotan el intervalo de validez temporal de los eventos para obtener plazos para la programación. El intervalo de validez define el punto en el tiempo después del cual un evento se vuelve temporalmente inconsistente. Por lo tanto, en un sistema en tiempo real, un evento es inútil después de este punto y que me descarte. La fecha límite de transmisión (DL) se define como el último punto en el tiempo en que un mensaje debe transmitirse y se especifica en un intervalo de tiempo que se deriva del tiempo de vencimiento: Tevent Ready <dl <texpiration - ∆notification Texpiration define el punto entiempo en que expira la validez temporal.Lanotificación es la latencia esperada de extremo a extremo que incluye el tiempo de transferencia a través de la red y el tiempo en que el evento puede retrasarse mediante el manejo de eventos locales en los nodos. Como se dijo antes, los plazos de eventos se utilizan para programar la difusión de SRTEC. Sin embargo, los plazos pueden perderse en situaciones de sobrecarga transitoria o debido a los tiempos de llegada arbitrarios de los eventos. Por el lado del editor, el controlador de excepciones de aplicaciones se llama cada vez que la fecha límite del evento expira antes de la transmisión del evento. En este momento, tampoco se espera que el evento llegue al lado del suscriptor antes de que expire la validez. Por lo tanto, el evento se elimina de la cola de envío. Por el lado del suscriptor, el tiempo de vencimiento se utiliza para programar la entrega del evento. Si el evento no se puede entregar hasta su tiempo de vencimiento, se elimina de las colas respectivas asignadas por el middleware cósmico. Esto evita que el sistema de comunicación se cargue por mensajes obsoletos. Los canales que no son de tiempo real no asumen ninguna especificación temporal y difunen eventos de la mejor manera. Se crea una instancia de un canal de eventos localmente, cada vez que un editor hace un anuncio para su publicación o un suscriptor de suscriptor para una notificación de eventos. Cuando un editor anuncia la publicación, el middleware crea las estructuras de datos respectivas de un canal de eventos. Cuando un suscriptor se suscribe a un canal de eventos, puede especificar los atributos de contexto de un evento que se utilizan para filtrar eventos localmente. P.ej.Un suscriptor solo puede estar interesado en los eventos generados en un lugar determinado. Además, el suscriptor especifica las propiedades de calidad del canal de eventos. Se puede encontrar una descripción más detallada de los canales de eventos en [13]. Actualmente, Cosmic maneja todos los canales de eventos que difunden eventos más allá del límite de la red CAN como canales de eventos no en tiempo real. Esto se debe principalmente a que usamos el protocolo TCP/IP para difundir eventos sobre enlaces inalámbricos o al Ethernet estándar. Sin embargo, hay una serie de mejoras posibles que se pueden integrar fácilmente en el modelo de canal de eventos. La base de computación oportuna (TCB) [28] puede explotarse para la detección de fallas de sincronización y, por lo tanto, proporcionaría conciencia sobre la diseminación de eventos en entornos donde no se puede aplicar la entrega oportuna de eventos. Además, hay protocolos inalámbricos que pueden proporcionar una entrega de mensajes oportuna y confiable [6, 23] que pueden explotarse para las clases de canales de eventos respectivas. Los eventos son los operadores de información que se intercambian entre objetos sensibles a través de canales de eventos. Para hacer frente a los requisitos de un entorno ad-hoc, un evento incluye la descripción del contexto en el que se ha generado y los atributos de calidad que definen los requisitos para la difusión. Esto es particularmente importante en un entorno abierto y dinámico donde un evento puede viajar a través de múltiples redes. Se especifica una instancia de evento como: Evento: = Sujeto, Contexto Atributelista, Attributalista de calidad, Contenido Un sujeto define el tipo de evento y está relacionado con el contenido del evento. Admite la comunicación anónima y se utiliza para enrutar un evento. El sujeto tiene que coincidir con el tema del canal del evento a través del cual se difunde el evento. Los atributos son complementarios al contenido del evento. Describen propiedades funcionales y no funcionales individuales del evento. Los atributos de contexto describen el entorno en el que se ha generado el evento, p.una ubicación, un modo operativo o un momento de ocurrencia. Los atributos de calidad especifican aspectos de puntualidad y confiabilidad en términos de intervalo de validez, pares de grado de omisión. El intervalo de validez define el punto en el tiempo después del cual un evento se vuelve temporalmente inconsistente [18]. Como se describió anteriormente, la validez temporal se puede asignar a una fecha límite. Sin embargo, generalmente un plazo es un artefacto de ingeniería que se utiliza para la programación, mientras que la validez temporal es una propiedad general de una entidad de valor de tiempo. En un entorno en el que no se puede hacer cumplir un plazo, un consumidor de un evento eventualmente debe decidir si el evento aún es temporalmente consistente, es decir, representa una entidad de valor válida de tiempo.7.1 La arquitectura del middleware cósmico a nivel arquitectónico, cósmico distinga tres capas representadas aproximadamente en la Figura 4. Dos de ellos, la capa de eventos y la capa de red abstracta son implementadas por el middleware cósmico. La capa de eventos proporciona la API para la aplicación y se da cuenta de la abstracción de los canales de eventos y eventos. La red abstracta implementa clases de mensajes en tiempo real y adapta los requisitos de calidad a la red real subyacente. Un controlador de canales de eventos reside en cada nodo. Admite la interfaz de programación y proporciona las estructuras de datos necesarias para la comunicación basada en eventos. Cada vez que un objeto se suscribe a un canal o un editor anuncia un canal, el controlador de canales de eventos está involucrado. Inicia la unión del sujeto de los canales, que está representado por un identificador único independiente de la red a una dirección de la red abstracta subyacente para habilitar la comunicación [14]. El controlador de canales del evento luego coopera estrechamente con los respectivos manejadores de la capa de red abstracta para difundir eventos o recibir notificaciones de eventos. Cabe señalar que las propiedades de QoS de la capa de eventos en general dependen de lo que pueda proporcionar la capa de red abstracta. Por lo tanto, no siempre es posible, p.Admite canales de eventos en tiempo real duros porque la capa de red abstracta no puede proporcionar las garantías respectivas. En [13], describimos los protocolos y servicios de la capa de red abstracta, particularmente para el bus CAN. Como se puede ver en la Figura 4, la clase de mensaje en tiempo real (HRT) es compatible con un controlador dedicado que puede proporcionar la difusión de mensajes activados por el tiempo.36 Notificaciones de eventos Lista HRT-MSG SRT-MSG Queue NRT-MSG Queue HRT-MSG Calendario HRTC Handler S/NRTC La capa de red abstracta de control puede capacitar el búfer RX Buffer TX RX, TX, Error interrumpe las especificaciones del canal de eventos.

El controlador HRT mantiene la lista de mensajes HRT, que contiene una entrada para cada mensaje HRT local que se enviará. La entrada contiene los parámetros para el mensaje, el estado de activación y la información de enlace. Los mensajes están programados en el bus de acuerdo con el calendario de mensajes HRT que comprende la hora de inicio precisa para cada intervalo de tiempo asignado para un mensaje. Las colas de mensajes en tiempo real suave ordenan mensajes salientes de acuerdo con sus plazos de transmisión derivados del intervalo de validez temporal. Si se excede la fecha límite de transmisión, el mensaje del evento se purga de la cola. La aplicación respectiva se notifica a través de la interfaz de notificación de excepción y puede tomar medidas como tratar de publicar el evento nuevamente o publicarlo en un canal de otra clase. Los mensajes de eventos entrantes se ordenan de acuerdo con su validez temporal. Si llega un mensaje de evento, se notifican las aplicaciones respectivas. Por el momento, se elimina un mensaje obsoleto de la cola y si la cola se queda sin espacio, el mensaje más antiguo se descarta. Sin embargo, hay otras políticas posibles según los atributos del evento y el espacio de memoria disponible. Los mensajes que no son en tiempo real se ordenan FIFO en un búfer circular de tamaño fijo.7.2 Estado de Cosmic El objetivo para desarrollar Cosmic era proporcionar una plataforma para integrar perfectamente componentes pequeños inteligentes en un sistema grande. Por lo tanto, Cosmic debe funcionar también en los pequeños dispositivos de restricción de recursos que se construyen alrededor de 16 bits o incluso microcontroladores de 8 bits. El middleware cósmico distribuido se ha implementado y probado en varias plataformas. Bajo RT-Linux, apoyamos los canales en tiempo real sobre el bus de lata como se describió anteriormente. La versión RTLinux se ejecuta en procesadores Pentium y actualmente se evalúa antes de que intentemos transferirla a un sensor o actuador inteligente. Para la interoperabilidad en un entorno WAN-of-CANS, solo proporcionamos canales no en tiempo real en este momento. Esta versión incluye una puerta de enlace entre el Canbus y una red TCP/IP. Nos permite usar una red inalámbrica 802.11 estándar. La versión no en tiempo real de Cosmic está disponible en Linux, RT-Linux y en las familias de microcontroladores C167 (Infineon) y 68HC908 (Motorola). Ambos microcontroladores tienen un controlador de lata integrado y, por lo tanto, no requieren componentes de hardware adicionales para la red. La huella de memoria de Cosmic es de aproximadamente 13 kbyte en un C167 y un poco más en el 68HC908 donde encaja en la memoria flash a bordo sin problemas. Debido a que solo se requieren unos pocos canales en un sensor de este tipo o componente de actuador, el requisito de RAM (que es un recurso escaso en muchos sistemas de chips individuales) para mantener las estructuras de datos dinámicas de un canal es bajo. El middleware cósmico hace que sea muy fácil incluir nuevos sensores inteligentes en un sistema existente. En particular, la aplicación que se ejecuta en un sensor inteligente para acondicionar y procesar los datos físicos sin procesar no debe tener en cuenta ningún detalle específico de red de bajo nivel. Interactúa sin problemas con otros componentes del sistema exclusivamente a través de canales de eventos. El ejemplo de demostración, descrito brevemente en el próximo capítulo, es utilizar una infraestructura distribuida de pequeños sensores inteligentes y actuadores que cooperan directamente a través de canales de eventos a través de redes heterogéneas.8. Un ejemplo ilustrativo, un ejemplo simple para muchas propiedades importantes del sistema propuesto que muestra la coordinación a través del entorno y los eventos difundidos sobre la red es la demostración de dos robots cooperantes representados en la Figura 5. Cada robot está equipado con sensores de distancia inteligentes, sensores de velocidad, sensores de aceleración y uno de los robots (la guía (KURT2) al frente (Figura 5)) tiene una cámara de seguimiento que permite seguir una línea blanca. Los robots forman un sistema WAN-of-CANS en el que sus latas locales están interconectadas a través de una red inalámbrica 802.11. Cosmic proporciona la capa de eventos para una interacción perfecta. El robot ciego (N.N.) está buscando en la guía al azar. Cada vez que el robot ciego detecta (por sus sensores de distancia frontal) un obstáculo, verifica si esta puede ser la guía. Para este propósito, se suscribe dinámicamente al canal de eventos que difunden eventos de distancia desde los sensores de distancia traseros de las guías y los compara con los eventos de distancia desde sus sensores frontales locales. Si la distancia es aproximadamente la misma, infiere que realmente está detrás de una guía. Ahora N.N.También se suscribe a los canales de eventos de la cámara de seguimiento y los sensores de velocidad 37 Figura 5: robots cooperantes.Para seguir la guía. La aplicación de demostración destaca las siguientes propiedades del sistema: 1. Interacción dinámica de robots que no se conoce de antemano. En principio, los dos robots desconocidos a priori pueden cooperar. Todo lo que los editores y suscriptores deben saber para interactuar dinámicamente en este entorno es el tema de la clase de eventos respectivas. Un problema será recibir solo los eventos del robot que está más cerca. Una identidad robot no ayuda mucho a resolver este problema. Más bien, la posición de la entidad de generación de eventos que se captura en los atributos respectivos se puede evaluar para filtrar el evento relevante fuera del flujo de eventos. Meier y Cahill [22] han propuesto un protocolo inalámbrico adecuado que utiliza proximidad a los eventos de filtro en el proyecto Cortex.2. Interacción a través del medio ambiente. La cooperación entre los robots se controla detectando la distancia entre los robots. Si la guía detecta que la distancia crece, se ralentiza. Respectivamente, si el robot ciego se acerca demasiado, reduce su velocidad. Los sensores de distancia locales producen eventos que se difunden a través de un canal de eventos de baja latencia y altamente predecible. El tiempo de reacción respectivo se puede calcular como función de la velocidad y la distancia de los robots y definir una fecha límite de difusión dinámica para los eventos. Por lo tanto, la interacción a través del entorno asegurará las propiedades de seguridad de la aplicación, es decir, el seguidor no se bloqueará en la guía y la guía no puede perder el seguidor. Además, los robots tienen suscripciones remotas a los eventos de distancia respectivos que se utilizan para verificarlo con las lecturas de sensores locales para validar que realmente siguen la guía que detectan con sus sensores locales. Debido a que puede haber latencias y omisiones más largas, este cheque ocasionalmente no será posible. La falta de disponibilidad de los eventos remotos disminuirá la calidad de la interacción y probablemente y ralentice los robots, pero no afectará las propiedades de seguridad.3. Detección cooperativa. El robot ciego se suscribe a los eventos de la cámara de seguimiento de la línea. Por lo tanto, puede ver a través del ojo de la guía. Debido a que sabe la distancia a la guía y la velocidad también, puede prever los movimientos necesarios. El sistema propuesto proporciona el marco arquitectónico para tal cooperación. El objeto sensible respectivo que controla la actuación del robot recibe como entrada la posición y la orientación de la línea blanca a rastrear. En el caso del robot guía, esta información se entrega directamente como un evento de cuerpo con una baja latencia y una alta confiabilidad sobre la red interna. Para el robot seguidor, la información también viene a través de un canal de eventos pero con diferentes atributos de calidad. Estos atributos de calidad se reflejan en la descripción del canal del evento. El objeto sensible que controla la actuación del seguidor es consciente del aumento de la latencia y una mayor probabilidad de omisión.9. Conclusión y trabajo futuro El documento aborda problemas de construir grandes sistemas distribuidos que interactúan con el entorno físico y se componen de una gran cantidad de componentes inteligentes. No podemos asumir que la arquitectura de red en dicho sistema es homogénea. Más bien, múltiples redes de borde se fusionan con una red de área amplia jerárquica y heterogénea. Conectan los pequeños sensores y actuadores que perciben el medio ambiente y proporcionan sensibilidad a la aplicación. Además, la movilidad y la implementación dinámica de componentes requieren la interacción dinámica sin esquemas fijos de direccionamiento y enrutamiento a priori conocidos. El trabajo presentado en el documento es una contribución hacia la interacción perfecta en un entorno que no debe estar restringido por obstáculos técnicos. Más bien debería ser posible controlar el flujo de información especificando explícitamente restricciones de difusión funcional y temporal. El documento presentó el modelo general de un objeto sensible para describir la composición, la encapsulación y la interacción en dicho entorno y desarrolló el equipo de arquitectura de eventos genéricos que integra la interacción a través del entorno y la red. Si bien las abstracciones apropiadas y los modelos de interacción pueden ocultar la heterogeneidad funcional de las redes, es imposible ocultar las diferencias de calidad. Por lo tanto, una de las principales preocupaciones es definir propiedades temporales en una infraestructura tan abierta. Se ha introducido la noción de un canal de eventos que permite especificar aspectos de calidad explícitamente. Se pueden verificar en la suscripción y definir un límite para la difusión de eventos. El middleware cósmico es un primer intento de poner en funcionamiento estos conceptos. Cosmic permite la interoperabilidad de pequeños componentes en múltiples límites de red y admite la definición de diferentes clases de canales de eventos en tiempo real. Hay muchas preguntas abiertas que surgieron de nuestro trabajo. Una dirección de la investigación futura será la inclusión de canales de comunicación del mundo real establecidos entre sensores y actuadores en el análisis temporal y el orden de tales eventos en una cadena de causa-efecto. Además, la provisión de detección de fallas de tiempo para la adaptación de las interacciones estará en el enfoque de nuestra investigación. Para reducir el tráfico de red y solo difundir esos eventos a los suscriptores en los que realmente están interesados y que tienen la oportunidad de llegar a tiempo, la encapsulación y los esquemas de alcance deben transformarse en las respectivas reglas de filtrado de niveles múltiples. Los atributos del evento que describen aspectos del contexto y las limitaciones temporales para la difusión se explotarán para este propósito. Finalmente, está destinado a integrar los resultados en el middleware cósmico para habilitar la evaluación experimental.38 10. Referencias [1] J. Bacon, K. Moody, J. Bates, R. Hayton, C. Ma, A.

        "However, classical event/object models are usually software oriented and, as such, when trans28 ported to a real-time, embedded systems setting, their harmony is cluttered by the conflict between, on the one side, send/receive of software events (message-based), and on the other side, input/output of hardware or real-world events, register-based.",
        "In terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security.",
        "This paper describes an architectural framework and a middleware, supporting a component-based system and an integrated view on event-based communication comprising the real world events and the events generated in the system.",
        "When choosing the appropriate interaction paradigm it is of fundamental importance to address the challenging issues of the envisaged sentient applications.",
        "Unlike classical approaches that confine the possible interactions to the application boundaries, i.e. to its components, we consider that the environment surrounding the application also plays a relevant role in this respect.",
        "Therefore, the paper starts by clarifying several issues concerning our view of the system, about the interactions that may take place and about the information flows.",
        "This view is complemented by providing an outline of the component-based system construction and, in particular, by showing that it is possible to compose larger applications from basic components, following an hierarchical composition approach.",

        "They are established prior to interaction to reserve the needed computational and network resources for highly predictable event dissemination.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 3 we introduce the fundamental notions and abstractions that we adopt in this work to describe the interactions taking place in the system.",
        "Then, in Section 4, we describe the componentbased approach that allows composition of objects.",
        "GEAR is then described in Section 5 and Section 6 focuses on temporal aspects of the interactions.",
        "Section 7 describes the COSMIC middleware, which may be used to specify the interaction between sentient objects.",
        "A simple example to highlight the ideas presented in the paper appears in Section 8 and Section 9 concludes the paper. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Our work considers a wired physical world in which a very large number of autonomous components cooperate.",
        "It is inspired by many research efforts in very different areas.",
        "Event-based systems in general have been introduced to meet the requirements of applications in which entities spontaneously generate information and disseminate it [1, 25, 22].",
        "Intended for large systems and requiring quite complex infrastructures, these event systems do not consider stringent quality aspects like timeliness and dependability issues.",
        "Secondly, they are not created to support inter-operability between tiny smart devices with substantial resource constraints.",
        "In [10] a real-time event system for CORBA has been introduced.",
        "The events are routed via a central event server which provides scheduling functions to support the real-time requirements.",
        "Such a central component is not available in an infrastructure envisaged in our system architecture and the developed middleware TAO (The Ace Orb) is quite complex and unsuitable to be directly integrated in smart devices.",
        "There are efforts to implement CORBA for control networks, tailored to connect sensor and actuator components [15, 19].",
        "They are targeted for the CAN-Bus [9], a popular network developed for the automotive industry.",
        "However, in these approaches the support for timeliness or dependability issues does not exist or is only very limited.",
        "A new scheme to integrate smart devices in a CORBA environment is proposed in [17] and has lead to the proposal of a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) [26].",
        "Smart transducers are organized in clusters that are connected to a CORBA system by a gateway.",
        "The clusters form isolated subnetworks.",
        "A special master node enforces the temporal properties in the cluster subnet.",
        "A CORBA gateway allows to access sensor data and write actuator data by means of an interface file system (IFS).",
        "The basic structure is similar to the WAN-of-CANs structure which has been introduced in the CORTEX project [4].",
        "Islands of tight control may be realized by a control network and cooperate via wired or wireless networks covering a large number of these subnetworks.",
        "However, in contrast to the event channel model introduced in this paper, all communication inside a cluster relies on a single technical solution of a synchronous communication channel.",
        "Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3.",
        "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
        "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
        "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
        "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
        "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
        "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
        "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
        "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
        "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
        "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
        "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
        "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
        "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
        "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
        "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
        "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
        "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
        "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
        "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
        "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
        "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
        "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
        "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
        "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
        "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
        "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
        "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
        "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
        "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
        "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
        "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
        "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
        "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
        "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
        "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
        "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
        "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
        "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
        "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
        "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
        "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
        "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
        "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
        "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
        "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
        "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
        "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
        "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
        "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
        "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
        "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",
        "Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.",
        "Consider a platoon of cooperating vehicles.",
        "Inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] or LIN [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth.",
        "On the other hand, the vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link.",
        "Finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer.",
        "At the abstraction level of sentient objects, such heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment.",
        "At the network level, we assume the WAN-of-CANs structure [27] to model the different networks.",
        "The notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively defined component-based object model.",
        "A body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service container for the sentient objects inside.",
        "On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a certain CAN.",
        "A CAN defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects.",
        "In the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see Figure 1).",
        "Correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone.",
        "At the network level, the wireless network represents the respective CAN.",
        "However, several platoons united by their CANs may interact with each other and objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of WAN-of-CANs.",
        "The notions of body-environment and WAN-of-CANs are very useful when defining interaction properties across such boundaries.",
        "Their introduction obeyed to our belief that a single mechanism to provide quality measures for interactions is not appropriate.",
        "Instead, a high level construct for interaction across boundaries is needed which allows to specify the quality of dissemination and exploits the knowledge about body and environment to assess the feasibility of quality constraints.",
        "As we will see in the following section, the notion of an event channel represents this construct in our architecture.",
        "It disseminates events and allows the network independent specification of quality attributes.",
        "These attributes must be mapped to the respective properties of the underlying network structure. 5.",
        "A GENERIC EVENTS ARCHITECTURE In order to successfully apply event-based object-oriented models, addressing the challenges enumerated in the introduction of this paper, it is necessary to use adequate architectural constructs, which allow the enforcement of fundamental properties such as timeliness or reliability.",
        "We propose the Generic-Events Architecture (GEAR), depicted in Figure 2, which we briefly describe in what follows (for a more detailed description please refer to [29]).",

        "In fact, the body is the internal environment of the object.",
        "This architecture layering allows composition to take place seamlessly, in what concerns information flow.",
        "Inside a body there may also be implicit knowledge, which can be exploited to make interaction more efficient, like the knowledge about the number of cooperating entities, the existence of a specific communication network or the simple fact that all components are co-located and thus the respective events do not need to specify location in their context attributes.",
        "Such intrinsic information is not available outside a body and, therefore, more explicit information has to be carried by an event.",

        "On the lower side this layer may also interact with dumb sensors or actuators, therefore talking the language of the specific device.",

        "Event Layer: The layer responsible for event propagation in the whole system, through several Event Channels (EC):.",
        "In concrete terms, this layer is a kind of middleware that provides important event-processing services which are crucial for any realistic event-based system.",
        "For example, some of the services that imply the processing of events may include publishing, subscribing, discrimination (zoning, filtering, fusion, tracing), and queuing.",
        "Communication Layer: The layer responsible for wrapping events (as a matter of fact, event descriptions in EC dialect) into carrier event-messages, to be transported to remote places.",
        "For example, a sensing event generated by a smart sensor is wrapped in an event-message and disseminated, to be caught by whoever is concerned.",
        "The same holds for an actuation event produced by a sentient object, to be delivered to a remote smart actuator.",
        "Likewise, this may apply to an event-message from one sentient object to another.",
        "Dumb sensors and actuators do not send event-messages, since they are unable to understand the EC dialect (they do not have an event layer neither a communication layer- they communicate, if needed, through operational networks).",
        "Regular Network: This is represented in the horizontal axis of the block diagram by the communication layer, which encompasses the usual LAN, TCP/IP, and realtime protocols, desirably augmented with reliable and/or ordered broadcast and other protocols.",
        "The GEAR introduces some innovative ideas in distributed systems architecture.",
        "While serving an object model based on production and consumption of generic events, it treats events produced by several sources (environment, body, objects) in a homogeneous way.",
        "This is possible due to the use of a common basic dialect for talking about events and due to the existence of the translation layer, which performs the necessary translation between the physical representation of a real-time entity and the EC compliant format.",
        "Crucial to the architecture is the event layer, which uses event channels to propagate events through regular network infrastructures.",
        "The event layer is realized by the COSMIC middleware, as described in Section 7. 5.1 Information Flow in GEAR The flow of information (external environment and computational part) is seamlessly supported by the L-shaped architecture.",
        "It occurs in a number of different ways, which demonstrates the expressiveness of the model with regard to the necessary forms of information encountered in real-time cooperative and embedded systems.",
        "Smart sensors produce events which report on the environment.",
        "Body sensors produce events which report on the body.",
        "They are disseminated by the local event layer module, on an event channel (EC) propagated through the regular network, to any relevant remote event layer modules where entities showed an interest on them, normally, sentient objects attached to the respective local event layer modules.",
        "Sentient objects consume events they are interested in, process them, and produce other events.",
        "Some of these events are destined to other sentient objects.",
        "They are published on an EC using the same EC dialect that serves, e.g., sensor originated events.",
        "However, these events are semantically of a kind such that they are to be subscribed by the relevant sentient objects, for example, the sentient objects composing a robot controller system, or, at a higher level, the sentient objects composing the actual robots in 32 a cooperative application.",
        "Smart actuators, on the other hand, merely consume events produced by sentient objects, whereby they accept and execute actuation commands.",
        "Alternatively to talking to other sentient objects, sentient objects can produce events of a lower level, for example, actuation commands on the body or environment.",
        "They publish these exactly the same way: on an event channel through the local event layer representative.",
        "Now, if these commands are of concern to local actuator units (e.g., body, including internal operational networks), they are passed on to the local translation layer.",
        "If they are of concern to a remote smart actuator, they are disseminated through the distributed event layer, to reach the former.",
        "In any case, if they are also of interest to other entities, such as other sentient objects that wish to be informed of the actuation command, then they are also disseminated through the EC to these sentient objects.",
        "A key advantage of this architecture is that event-messages and physical events can be globally ordered, if necessary, since they all pass through the event layer.",
        "The model also offers opportunities to solve a long lasting problem in realtime, computer control, and embedded systems: the inconsistency between message passing and the feedback loop information flow subsystems. 6.",
        "TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF THE INTERACTIONS Any interaction needs some form of predictability.",
        "If safety critical scenarios are considered as it is done in CORTEX, temporal aspects become crucial and have to be made explicit.",
        "The problem is how to define temporal constraints and how to enforce them by appropriate resource usage in a dynamic ad-hoc environment.",
        "In an system where interactions are spontaneous, it may be also necessary to determine temporal properties dynamically.",
        "To do this, the respective temporal information must be stated explicitly and available during run-time.",
        "Secondly, it is not always ensured that temporal properties can be fulfilled.",
        "In these cases, adaptations and timing failure notification must be provided [2, 28].",
        "In most real-time systems, the notion of a deadline is the prevailing scheme to express and enforce timeliness.",
        "However, a deadline only weakly reflect the temporal characteristics of the information which is handled.",
        "Secondly, a deadline often includes implicit knowledge about the system and the relations between activities.",
        "In a rather well defined, closed environment, it is possible to make such implicit assumptions and map these to execution times and deadlines.",
        "E.g. the engineer knows how long a vehicle position can be used before the vehicle movement outdates this information.",
        "Thus he maps this dependency between speed and position on a deadline which then assures that the position error can be assumed to be bounded.",
        "In a open environment, this implicit mapping is not possible any more because, as an obvious reason, the relation between speed and position, and thus the error bound, cannot easily be reverse engineered from a deadline.",
        "Therefore, our event model includes explicit quality attributes which allow to specify the temporal attributes for every individual event.",
        "This is of course an overhead compared to the use of implicit knowledge, but in a dynamic environment such information is needed.",
        "To illustrate the problem, consider the example of the position of a vehicle.",
        "A position is a typical example for time, value entity [30].",
        "Thus, the position is useful if we can determine an error bound which is related to time, e.g. if we want a position error below 10 meters to establish a safety property between cooperating cars moving with 5 m/sec, the position has a validity time of 2 seconds.",
        "In a time, value entity entity we can trade time against the precision of the value.",
        "This is known as value over time and time over value [18].",
        "Once having established the time-value relation and captured in event attributes, subscribers of this event can locally decide about the usefulness of an information.",
        "In the GEAR architecture temporal validity is used to reason about safety properties in a event-based system [29].",
        "We will briefly review the respective notions and see how they are exploited in our COSMIC event middleware.",
        "Consider the timeline of generating an event representing some real-time entity [18] from its occurrence to the notification of a certain sentient object (Figure 3).",
        "The real-time entity is captured at the sensor interface of the system and has to be transformed in a form which can be treated by a computer.",
        "During the time interval t0 the sensor reads the real-time entity and a time stamp is associated with the respective value.",
        "The derived time, value entity represents an observation.",
        "It may be necessary to perform substantial local computations to derive application relevant information from the raw sensor data.",
        "However, it should be noted that the time stamp of the observation is associated with the capture time and thus independent from further signal processing and event generation.",
        "This close relationship between capture time and the associated value is supported by smart sensors described above.",
        "The processed sensor information is assembled in an event data structure after ts to be published to an event channel.",
        "As is described later, the event includes the time stamp of generation and the temporal validity as attributes.",
        "The temporal validity is an application defined measure for the expiration of a time, value .",
        "As we explained in the example of a position above, it may vary dependent on application parameters.",
        "Temporal validity is a more general concept than that of a deadline.",
        "It is independent of a certain technical implementation of a system.",
        "While deadlines may be used to schedule the respective steps in an event generation and dissemination, a temporal validity is an intrinsic property of a time, value entity carried in an event.",
        "A temporal validity allows to reason about the usefulness of information and is beneficial even in systems in which timely dissemination of events cannot be enforced because it enables timing failure detection at the event consumer.",
        "It is obvious that deadlines or periods can be derived from the temporal validity of an event.",
        "To set a deadline, knowledge of an implementation, worst case execution times or message dissemination latencies is necessary.",
        "Thus, in the timeline of Figure 3 every interval may have a deadline.",
        "Event dissemination through soft real-time channels in COSMIC exploits the temporal validity to define dissemination deadlines.",
        "Quality attributes can be defined, for instance, in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs.",
        "These allow to characterize the usefulness of the event for a certain application, in a certain context.",
        "Because of that, quality attributes of an event clearly depend on higher level issues, such as the nature of the sentient object or of the smart sensor that produced the event.",
        "For instance, an event containing an indication of some vehicle speed must have different quality attributes depending on the kind of vehicle 33 real-world event observation: <time stamp, value> event generated ready to be transmitted event received notification , to t event producer communication network event consumer event channel push <event> , ts , tm , tt , tn , t o : t i m e t o o b t a i n a n o b s e r v a t i o n , t s : t i m e t o p r o c e s s s e n s o r r e a d i n g , t m : t i m e t o a s s e m b l e a n e v e n t m e s s a g e , t t : t i m e t o t r a n s f e r t h e e v e n t o n t h e r e g u l a r n e t w o r k , t n : t i m e f o r n o t i f i c a t i o n o n t h e c o n s u m e r s i t e Figure 3: Event processing and dissemination. from which it originated, or depending on its current speed.",
        "The same happens with the position event of the car example above, whose validity depends on the current speed and on a predefined required precision.",
        "However, since quality attributes are strictly related with the semantics of the application or, at least, with some high level knowledge of the purpose of the system (from which the validity of the information can be derived), the definition of these quality attributes may be done by exploiting the information provided at the programming interface.",
        "Therefore, it is important to understand how the system programmer can specify non-functional requirements at the API, and how these requirements translate into quality attributes assigned to events.",
        "While temporal validity is identified as an intrinsic event property, which is exploited to decide on the usefulness of data at a certain point in time, it is still necessary to provide a communication facility which can disseminate the event before the validity is expired.",
        "In a WAN-of-CANs network structure we have to cope with very different network characteristics and quality of service properties.",
        "Therefore, when crossing the network boundaries the quality of service guarantees available in a certain network will be lost and it will be very hard, costly and perhaps impossible to achieve these properties in the next larger area of the WAN-of CANs structure.",
        "CORTEX has a couple of abstractions to cope with this situation (network zones, body/environment) which have been discussed above.",
        "From the temporal point of view we need a high level abstraction like the temporal validity for the individual event now to express our quality requirements of the dissemination over the network.",
        "The bound, coverage pair, introduced in relation with the TCB [28] seems to be an appropriate approach.",
        "It considers the inherent uncertainty of networks and allows to trade the quality of dissemination against the resources which are needed.",
        "In relation with the event channel model discussed later, the bound, coverage pair allows to specify the quality properties of an event channel independently of specific technical issues.",
        "Given the typical environments in which sentient applications will operate, where it is difficult or even impossible to provide timeliness or reliability guarantees, we proposed an alternative way to handle non-functional application requirements, in relation with the TCB approach [28].",
        "The proposed approach exploits intrinsic characteristics of applications, such as fail-safety, or time-elasticity, in order to secure QoS specifications of the form bound, coverage .",
        "Instead of constructing systems that rely on guaranteed bounds, the idea is to use (possibly changing) bounds that are secured with a constant probability all over the execution.",
        "This obviously requires an application to be able to adapt to changing conditions (and/or changing bounds) or, if this is not possible, to be able to perform some safety procedures when the operational conditions degrade to an unbearable level.",
        "The bounds we mentioned above refer essentially to timeliness bounds associated to the execution of local or distributed activities, or combinations thereof.",
        "From these bounds it is then possible to derive the quality attributes, in particular validity intervals, that characterize the events published in the event channel. 6.1 The Role of Smart Sensors and Actuators Smart devices encapsulate hardware, software and mechanical components and provide information and a set of well specified functions and which are closely related to the interaction with the environment.",
        "The built-in computational components and the network interface enable the implementation of a well-defined high level interface that does not just provide raw transducer data, but a processed, application-related set of events.",
        "Moreover, they exhibit an autonomous spontaneous behaviour.",
        "They differ from general purpose nodes because they are dedicated to a certain functionality which complies to their sensing and actuating capabilities while general purpose node may execute any program.",
        "Concerning the sentient object model, smart sensors and actuators may be basic sentient objects themselves, consuming events from the real-world environment and producing the respective generic events for the systems event layer or, 34 vice versa consuming a generic event and converting it to a real-world event by an actuation.",
        "Smart components therefore constitute the periphery, i.e. the real-world interface of a more complex sentient object.",
        "The model of sentient objects also constitutes the framework to built more complex virtual sensors by relating multiple (primary, i.e. sensors which directly sense a physical entity) sensors.",
        "Smart components translate events of the environment to an appropriate form available at the event layer or, vice versa, transform a system event into an actuation.",
        "For smart components we can assume that: • Smart components have dedicated resources to perform a specific function. • These resources are not used for other purposes during normal real-time operation. • No local temporal conflicts occur that will change the observable temporal behaviour. • The functions of a component can usually only be changed during a configuration procedure which is not performed when the component is involved in critical operations. • An observation of the environment as a time,value pair can be obtained with a bounded jitter in time.",
        "Many predictability and scheduling problems arise from the fact, that very low level timing behaviours have to be handled on a single processor.",
        "Here, temporal encapsulation of activities is difficult because of the possible side effects when sharing a single processor resource.",
        "Consider the control of a simple IR-range detector which is used for obstacle avoidance.",
        "Dependent on its range and the speed of a vehicle, it has to be polled to prevent the vehicle from crashing into an obstacle.",
        "On a single central processor, this critical activity has to be coordinated with many similar, possibly less critical functions.",
        "It means that a very fine grained schedule has to be derived based purely on the artifacts of the low level device control.",
        "In a smart sensor component, all this low level timing behaviour can be optimized and encapsulated.",
        "Thus we can assume temporal encapsulation similar to information hiding in the functional domain.",
        "Of course, there is still the problem to guarantee that an event will be disseminated and recognized in due time by the respective system components, but this relates to application related events rather than the low artifacts of a device timing.",
        "The main responsibility to provide timeliness guarantees is shifted to the event layer where these events are disseminated.",
        "Smart sensors thus lead to network centric system model.",
        "The network constitute the shared resource which has to be scheduled in a predictable way.",
        "The COSMIC middleware introduced in the next section is an approach to provide predictable event dissemination for a network of smart sensors and actuators. 7.",
        "AN EVENT MODEL ANDMIDDLEWARE FOR COOPERATING SMART DEVICES An event model and a middleware suitable for smart components must support timely and reliable communication and also must be resource efficient.",
        "COSMIC (COoperating Smart devices) is aimed at supporting the interaction between those components according to the concepts introduced so far.",
        "Based on the model of a WAN-of-CANs, we assume that the components are connected to some form of CAN as a fieldbus or a special wireless sensor network which provides specific network properties.",
        "E.g. a fieldbus developed for control applications usually includes mechanisms for predictable communication while other networks only support a best effort dissemination.",
        "A gateway connects these CANs to the next level in the network hierarchy.",
        "The event system should allow the dynamic interaction over a hierarchy of such networks and comply with the overall CORTEX generic event model.",
        "Events are typed information carriers and are disseminated in a publisher/ subscriber style [24, 7], which is particularly suitable because it supports generative, anonymous communication [3] and does not create any artificial control dependencies between producers of information and the consumers.",
        "This decoupling in space (no references or names of senders or receivers are needed for communication) and the flow decoupling (no control transfer occurs with a data transfer) are well known [24, 7, 14] and crucial properties to maintain autonomy of components and dynamic interactions.",
        "It is obvious that not all networks can provide the same QoS guarantees and secondly, applications may have widely differing requirements for event dissemination.",
        "Additionally, when striving for predictability, resources have to be reserved and data structures must be set up before communication takes place.",
        "Thus, these things can not predictably be made on the fly while disseminating an event.",
        "Therefore, we introduced the notion of an event channel to cope with differing properties and requirements and have an object to which we can assign resources and reservations.",
        "The concept of an event channel is not new [10, 25], however, it has not yet been used to reflect the properties of the underlying heterogeneous communication networks and mechanisms as described by the GEAR architecture.",
        "Rather, existing event middleware allows to specify the priorities or deadlines of events handled in an event server.",
        "Event channels allow to specify the communication properties on the level of the event system in a fine grained way.",
        "An event channel is defined by: event channel := subject, quality attributeList, handlers The subject determines the types of events event which may be issued to the channel.",
        "The quality attributes model the properties of the underlying communication network and dissemination scheme.",
        "These attributes include latency specifications, dissemination constraints and reliability parameters.",
        "The notion of zones which represent a guaranteed quality of service in a subnetwork support this approach.",
        "Our goal is to handle the temporal specifications as bound, coverage pairs [28] orthogonal to the more technical questions of how to achieve a certain synchrony property of the dissemination infrastructure.",
        "Currently, we support quality attributes of event channels in a CAN-Bus environment represented by explicit synchrony classes.",
        "The COSMIC middleware maps the channel properties to lower level protocols of the regular network.",
        "Based on our previous work on predictable protocols for the CAN-Bus, COSMIC defines an abstract network which provides hard, soft and non real-time message classes [21].",
        "Correspondingly, we distinguish three event channel classes according to their synchrony properties: hard real-time channels, soft real-time channels and non-real-time channels.",
        "Hard real-time channels (HRTC) guarantee event propagation within the defined time constraints in the presence 35 of a specified number of omission faults.",
        "HRTECs are supported by a reservation scheme which is similar to the scheme used in time-triggered protocols like TTP [16][31], TTP/A [17], and TTCAN [8].",
        "However, a substantial advantage over a TDMA scheme is that due to CAN-Bus properties, bandwidth which was reserved but is not needed by a HRTEC can be used by less critical traffic [21].",
        "Soft real-time channels (SRTC) exploit the temporal validity interval of events to derive deadlines for scheduling.",
        "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent.",
        "Therefore, in a real-time system an event is useless after this point and may me discarded.",
        "The transmission deadline (DL) is defined as the latest point in time when a message has to be transmitted and is specified in a time interval which is derived from the expiration time: tevent ready < DL < texpiration − ∆notification texpiration defines the point in time when the temporal validity expires. ∆notification is the expected end-to-end latency which includes the transfer time over the network and the time the event may be delayed by the local event handling in the nodes.",
        "As said before, event deadlines are used to schedule the dissemination by SRTECs.",
        "However, deadlines may be missed in transient overload situations or due to arbitrary arrival times of events.",
        "On the publisher side the applications exception handler is called whenever the event deadline expires before event transmission.",
        "At this point in time the event is also not expected to arrive at the subscriber side before the validity expires.",
        "Therefore, the event is removed from the sending queue.",
        "On the subscriber side the expiration time is used to schedule the delivery of the event.",
        "If the event cannot be delivered until its expiration time it is removed from the respective queues allocated by the COSMIC middleware.",
        "This prevents the communication system to be loaded by outdated messages.",
        "Non-real-time channels do not assume any temporal specification and disseminate events in a best effort manner.",
        "An instance of an event channel is created locally, whenever a publisher makes an announcement for publication or a subscriber subscribes for an event notification.",
        "When a publisher announces publication, the respective data structures of an event channel are created by the middleware.",
        "When a subscriber subscribes to an event channel, it may specify context attributes of an event which are used to filter events locally.",
        "E.g. a subscriber may only be interested in events generated at a certain location.",
        "Additionally the subscriber specifies quality properties of the event channel.",
        "A more detailed description of the event channels can be found in [13].",
        "Currently, COSMIC handles all event channels which disseminate events beyond the CAN network boundary as non real-time event channels.",
        "This is mainly because we use the TCP/IP protocol to disseminate events over wireless links or to the standard Ethernet.",
        "However, there are a number of possible improvements which can easily be integrated in the event channel model.",
        "The Timely Computing Base (TCB) [28] can be exploited for timing failure detection and thus would provide awareness for event dissemination in environments where timely delivery of events cannot be enforced.",
        "Additionally, there are wireless protocols which can provide timely and reliable message delivery [6, 23] which may be exploited for the respective event channel classes.",
        "Events are the information carriers which are exchanged between sentient objects through event channels.",
        "To cope with the requirements of an ad-hoc environment, an event includes the description of the context in which it has been generated and quality attributes defining requirements for dissemination.",
        "This is particularly important in an open, dynamic environment where an event may travel over multiple networks.",
        "An event instance is specified as: event := subject, context attributeList, quality attributeList, contents A subject defines the type of the event and is related to the event contents.",
        "It supports anonymous communication and is used to route an event.",
        "The subject has to match to the subject of the event channel through which the event is disseminated.",
        "Attributes are complementary to the event contents.",
        "They describe individual functional and non-functional properties of the event.",
        "The context attributes describe the environment in which the event has been generated, e.g. a location, an operational mode or a time of occurrence.",
        "The quality attributes specify timeliness and dependability aspects in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs.",
        "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent [18].",
        "As described above, the temporal validity can be mapped to a deadline.",
        "However, usually a deadline is an engineering artefact which is used for scheduling while the temporal validity is a general property of a time, value entity.",
        "In a environment where a deadline cannot be enforced, a consumer of an event eventually must decide whether the event still is temporally consistent, i.e. represents a valid time, value entity. 7.1 The Architecture of the COSMIC Middleware On the architectural level, COSMIC distinguish three layers roughly depicted in Figure 4.",
        "Two of them, the event layer and the abstract network layer are implemented by the COSMIC middleware.",
        "The event layer provides the API for the application and realizes the abstraction of event and event channels.",
        "The abstract network implements real-time message classes and adapts the quality requirements to the underlying real network.",
        "An event channel handler resides in every node.",
        "It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication.",
        "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",
        "It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14].",
        "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
        "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
        "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",
        "In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus.",

        "The memory footprint of COSMIC is about 13 Kbyte on a C167 and slightly more on the 68HC908 where it fits into the on-board flash memory without problems.",
        "Because only a few channels are required on such a smart sensor or actuator component, the requirement of RAM (which is a scarce resource on many single chip systems) to hold the dynamic data structures of a channel is low.",
        "The COSMIC middleware makes it very easy to include new smart sensors in an existing system.",
        "Particularly, the application running on a smart sensor to condition and process the raw physical data must not be aware of any low level network specific details.",

        "Because there may be longer latencies and omissions, this check occasionally will not be possible.",

        "They connect the tiny sensors and actuators perceiving the environment and providing sentience to the application.",
        "Additionally, mobility and dynamic deployment of components require the dynamic interaction without fixed, a priori known addressing and routing schemes.",
        "The work presented in the paper is a contribution towards the seamless interaction in such an environment which should not be restricted by technical obstacles.",
        "Rather it should be possible to control the flow of information by explicitly specifying functional and temporal dissemination constraints.",
        "The paper presented the general model of a sentient object to describe composition, encapsulation and interaction in such an environment and developed the Generic Event Architecture GEAR which integrates the interaction through the environment and the network.",
        "While appropriate abstractions and interaction models can hide the functional heterogeneity of the networks, it is impossible to hide the quality differences.",

        "One direction of future research will be the inclusion of real-world communication channels established between sensors and actuators in the temporal analysis and the ordering of such events in a cause-effect chain.",
        "Additionally, the provision of timing failure detection for the adaptation of interactions will be in the focus of our research.",
        "To reduce network traffic and only disseminate those events to the subscribers which they are really interested in and which have a chance to arrive timely, the encapsulation and scoping schemes have to be transformed into respective multi-level filtering rules.",
        "The event attributes which describe aspects of the context and temporal constraints for the dissemination will be exploited for this purpose.",

                "In terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",

                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",

                "Based on the model of a WAN-of-CANs, we assume that the components are connected to some form of CAN as a fieldbus or a special wireless sensor network which provides specific network properties.",
                "E.g. a fieldbus developed for control applications usually includes mechanisms for predictable communication while other networks only support a best effort dissemination.",
                "A gateway connects these CANs to the next level in the network hierarchy.",
                "The event system should allow the dynamic interaction over a hierarchy of such networks and comply with the overall CORTEX generic event model.",
                "Events are typed information carriers and are disseminated in a publisher/ subscriber style [24, 7], which is particularly suitable because it supports generative, anonymous communication [3] and does not create any artificial control dependencies between producers of information and the consumers.",
                "This decoupling in space (no references or names of senders or receivers are needed for communication) and the flow decoupling (no control transfer occurs with a data transfer) are well known [24, 7, 14] and crucial properties to maintain autonomy of components and dynamic interactions.",
                "It is obvious that not all networks can provide the same QoS guarantees and secondly, applications may have widely differing requirements for event dissemination.",
                "Additionally, when striving for predictability, resources have to be reserved and data structures must be set up before communication takes place.",
                "Thus, these things can not predictably be made on the fly while disseminating an event.",
                "Therefore, we introduced the notion of an event channel to cope with differing properties and requirements and have an object to which we can assign resources and reservations.",
                "The concept of an event channel is not new [10, 25], however, it has not yet been used to reflect the properties of the underlying heterogeneous communication networks and mechanisms as described by the GEAR architecture.",
                "Rather, existing event middleware allows to specify the priorities or deadlines of events handled in an event server.",
                "Event channels allow to specify the communication properties on the level of the event system in a fine grained way.",
                "An event channel is defined by: event channel := subject, quality attributeList, handlers The subject determines the types of events event which may be issued to the channel.",
                "The quality attributes model the properties of the underlying communication network and dissemination scheme.",
                "These attributes include latency specifications, dissemination constraints and reliability parameters.",
                "The notion of zones which represent a guaranteed quality of service in a subnetwork support this approach.",
                "Our goal is to handle the temporal specifications as bound, coverage pairs [28] orthogonal to the more technical questions of how to achieve a certain synchrony property of the dissemination infrastructure.",
                "Currently, we support quality attributes of event channels in a CAN-Bus environment represented by explicit synchrony classes.",
                "The COSMIC middleware maps the channel properties to lower level protocols of the regular network.",
                "Based on our previous work on predictable protocols for the CAN-Bus, COSMIC defines an abstract network which provides hard, soft and non real-time message classes [21].",
                "Correspondingly, we distinguish three event channel classes according to their synchrony properties: hard real-time channels, soft real-time channels and non-real-time channels.",
                "Hard real-time channels (HRTC) guarantee event propagation within the defined time constraints in the presence 35 of a specified number of omission faults.",
                "HRTECs are supported by a reservation scheme which is similar to the scheme used in time-triggered protocols like TTP [16][31], TTP/A [17], and TTCAN [8].",
                "However, a substantial advantage over a TDMA scheme is that due to CAN-Bus properties, bandwidth which was reserved but is not needed by a HRTEC can be used by less critical traffic [21].",
                "Soft real-time channels (SRTC) exploit the temporal validity interval of events to derive deadlines for scheduling.",
                "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent.",
                "Therefore, in a real-time system an event is useless after this point and may me discarded.",
                "The transmission deadline (DL) is defined as the latest point in time when a message has to be transmitted and is specified in a time interval which is derived from the expiration time: tevent ready < DL < texpiration − ∆notification texpiration defines the point in time when the temporal validity expires. ∆notification is the expected end-to-end latency which includes the transfer time over the network and the time the event may be delayed by the local event handling in the nodes.",
                "As said before, event deadlines are used to schedule the dissemination by SRTECs.",
                "However, deadlines may be missed in transient overload situations or due to arbitrary arrival times of events.",
                "On the publisher side the applications exception handler is called whenever the event deadline expires before event transmission.",
                "At this point in time the event is also not expected to arrive at the subscriber side before the validity expires.",
                "Therefore, the event is removed from the sending queue.",
                "On the subscriber side the expiration time is used to schedule the delivery of the event.",
                "If the event cannot be delivered until its expiration time it is removed from the respective queues allocated by the COSMIC middleware.",
                "This prevents the communication system to be loaded by outdated messages.",
                "Non-real-time channels do not assume any temporal specification and disseminate events in a best effort manner.",
                "An instance of an event channel is created locally, whenever a publisher makes an announcement for publication or a subscriber subscribes for an event notification.",
                "When a publisher announces publication, the respective data structures of an event channel are created by the middleware.",
                "When a subscriber subscribes to an event channel, it may specify context attributes of an event which are used to filter events locally.",
                "E.g. a subscriber may only be interested in events generated at a certain location.",
                "Additionally the subscriber specifies quality properties of the event channel.",
                "A more detailed description of the event channels can be found in [13].",
                "Currently, COSMIC handles all event channels which disseminate events beyond the CAN network boundary as non real-time event channels.",
                "This is mainly because we use the TCP/IP protocol to disseminate events over wireless links or to the standard Ethernet.",
                "However, there are a number of possible improvements which can easily be integrated in the event channel model.",
                "The Timely Computing Base (TCB) [28] can be exploited for timing failure detection and thus would provide awareness for event dissemination in environments where timely delivery of events cannot be enforced.",
                "Additionally, there are wireless protocols which can provide timely and reliable message delivery [6, 23] which may be exploited for the respective event channel classes.",
                "Events are the information carriers which are exchanged between sentient objects through event channels.",
                "To cope with the requirements of an ad-hoc environment, an event includes the description of the context in which it has been generated and quality attributes defining requirements for dissemination.",
                "This is particularly important in an open, dynamic environment where an event may travel over multiple networks.",
                "An event instance is specified as: event := subject, context attributeList, quality attributeList, contents A subject defines the type of the event and is related to the event contents.",
                "It supports anonymous communication and is used to route an event.",
                "The subject has to match to the subject of the event channel through which the event is disseminated.",
                "Attributes are complementary to the event contents.",
                "They describe individual functional and non-functional properties of the event.",
                "The context attributes describe the environment in which the event has been generated, e.g. a location, an operational mode or a time of occurrence.",
                "The quality attributes specify timeliness and dependability aspects in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs.",
                "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent [18].",
                "As described above, the temporal validity can be mapped to a deadline.",
                "However, usually a deadline is an engineering artefact which is used for scheduling while the temporal validity is a general property of a time, value entity.",
                "In a environment where a deadline cannot be enforced, a consumer of an event eventually must decide whether the event still is temporally consistent, i.e. represents a valid time, value entity. 7.1 The Architecture of the COSMIC Middleware On the architectural level, COSMIC distinguish three layers roughly depicted in Figure 4.",
                "Two of them, the event layer and the abstract network layer are implemented by the COSMIC middleware.",
                "The event layer provides the API for the application and realizes the abstraction of event and event channels.",
                "The abstract network implements real-time message classes and adapts the quality requirements to the underlying real network.",
                "An event channel handler resides in every node.",
                "It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication.",
                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",
                "It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14].",
                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",
                "In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus.",

                "Incoming event messages are ordered according to their temporal validity.",
                "If an event message arrive, the respective applications are notified.",
                "At the moment, an outdated message is deleted from the queue and if the queue runs out of space, the oldest message is discarded.",

                "Both micro-controllers have an on-board CAN controller and thus do not require additional hardware components for the network.",
                "The memory footprint of COSMIC is about 13 Kbyte on a C167 and slightly more on the 68HC908 where it fits into the on-board flash memory without problems.",
                "Because only a few channels are required on such a smart sensor or actuator component, the requirement of RAM (which is a scarce resource on many single chip systems) to hold the dynamic data structures of a channel is low.",
                "The COSMIC middleware makes it very easy to include new smart sensors in an existing system.",
                "Particularly, the application running on a smart sensor to condition and process the raw physical data must not be aware of any low level network specific details.",

                "The respective reaction time can be calculated as function of the speed and the distance of the robots and define a dynamic dissemination deadline for events.",
                "Thus, the interaction through the environment will secure the safety properties of the application, i.e. the follower may not crash into the guide and the guide may not loose the follower.",
                "Additionally, the robots have remote subscriptions to the respective distance events which are used to check it with the local sensor readings to validate that they really follow the guide which they detect with their local sensors.",
                "Because there may be longer latencies and omissions, this check occasionally will not be possible.",
                "The unavailability of the remote events will decrease the quality of interaction and probably and slow down the robots, but will not affect safety properties. 3.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
                "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
                "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
                "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",
                "Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.",

                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",

                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
                "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
                "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
                "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",
                "Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.",
                "Consider a platoon of cooperating vehicles.",
                "Inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] or LIN [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth.",
                "On the other hand, the vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link.",
                "Finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer.",
                "At the abstraction level of sentient objects, such heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment.",
                "At the network level, we assume the WAN-of-CANs structure [27] to model the different networks.",
                "The notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively defined component-based object model.",
                "A body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service container for the sentient objects inside.",
                "On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a certain CAN.",
                "A CAN defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects.",
                "In the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see Figure 1).",
                "Correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone.",
                "At the network level, the wireless network represents the respective CAN.",
                "However, several platoons united by their CANs may interact with each other and objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of WAN-of-CANs.",

                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",

                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",

                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",

                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",

                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",

                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",

                "Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3.",
                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",

                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a <br>sentient object</br> actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "<br>sentient object</br> COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the <br>sentient object</br> paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a <br>sentient object</br> as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a <br>sentient object</br> is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware <br>sentient object</br> composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of <br>sentient object</br> as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a <br>sentient object</br>.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a <br>sentient object</br>, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot <br>sentient object</br> may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",

                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",

                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",

                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",

                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",

                "Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3.",
                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST <br>cortex</br> project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in <br>cortex</br> and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",

                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",

                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",

                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",

                "Based on the model of a WAN-of-CANs, we assume that the components are connected to some form of CAN as a fieldbus or a special wireless sensor network which provides specific network properties.",
                "E.g. a fieldbus developed for control applications usually includes mechanisms for predictable communication while other networks only support a best effort dissemination.",
                "A gateway connects these CANs to the next level in the network hierarchy.",
                "The event system should allow the dynamic interaction over a hierarchy of such networks and comply with the overall CORTEX generic event model.",
                "Events are typed information carriers and are disseminated in a publisher/ subscriber style [24, 7], which is particularly suitable because it supports generative, anonymous communication [3] and does not create any artificial control dependencies between producers of information and the consumers.",
                "This decoupling in space (no references or names of senders or receivers are needed for communication) and the flow decoupling (no control transfer occurs with a data transfer) are well known [24, 7, 14] and crucial properties to maintain autonomy of components and dynamic interactions.",
                "It is obvious that not all networks can provide the same QoS guarantees and secondly, applications may have widely differing requirements for event dissemination.",
                "Additionally, when striving for predictability, resources have to be reserved and data structures must be set up before communication takes place.",
                "Thus, these things can not predictably be made on the fly while disseminating an event.",
                "Therefore, we introduced the notion of an event channel to cope with differing properties and requirements and have an object to which we can assign resources and reservations.",
                "The concept of an event channel is not new [10, 25], however, it has not yet been used to reflect the properties of the underlying heterogeneous communication networks and mechanisms as described by the GEAR architecture.",
                "Rather, existing event middleware allows to specify the priorities or deadlines of events handled in an event server.",
                "Event channels allow to specify the communication properties on the level of the event system in a fine grained way.",
                "An event channel is defined by: event channel := subject, quality attributeList, handlers The subject determines the types of events event which may be issued to the channel.",
                "The quality attributes model the properties of the underlying communication network and dissemination scheme.",
                "These attributes include latency specifications, dissemination constraints and reliability parameters.",
                "The notion of zones which represent a guaranteed quality of service in a subnetwork support this approach.",
                "Our goal is to handle the temporal specifications as bound, coverage pairs [28] orthogonal to the more technical questions of how to achieve a certain synchrony property of the dissemination infrastructure.",
                "Currently, we support quality attributes of event channels in a CAN-Bus environment represented by explicit synchrony classes.",
                "The <br>cosmic middleware</br> maps the channel properties to lower level protocols of the regular network.",
                "Based on our previous work on predictable protocols for the CAN-Bus, COSMIC defines an abstract network which provides hard, soft and non real-time message classes [21].",
                "Correspondingly, we distinguish three event channel classes according to their synchrony properties: hard real-time channels, soft real-time channels and non-real-time channels.",
                "Hard real-time channels (HRTC) guarantee event propagation within the defined time constraints in the presence 35 of a specified number of omission faults.",
                "HRTECs are supported by a reservation scheme which is similar to the scheme used in time-triggered protocols like TTP [16][31], TTP/A [17], and TTCAN [8].",
                "However, a substantial advantage over a TDMA scheme is that due to CAN-Bus properties, bandwidth which was reserved but is not needed by a HRTEC can be used by less critical traffic [21].",
                "Soft real-time channels (SRTC) exploit the temporal validity interval of events to derive deadlines for scheduling.",
                "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent.",
                "Therefore, in a real-time system an event is useless after this point and may me discarded.",
                "The transmission deadline (DL) is defined as the latest point in time when a message has to be transmitted and is specified in a time interval which is derived from the expiration time: tevent ready < DL < texpiration − ∆notification texpiration defines the point in time when the temporal validity expires. ∆notification is the expected end-to-end latency which includes the transfer time over the network and the time the event may be delayed by the local event handling in the nodes.",
                "As said before, event deadlines are used to schedule the dissemination by SRTECs.",
                "However, deadlines may be missed in transient overload situations or due to arbitrary arrival times of events.",
                "On the publisher side the applications exception handler is called whenever the event deadline expires before event transmission.",
                "At this point in time the event is also not expected to arrive at the subscriber side before the validity expires.",
                "Therefore, the event is removed from the sending queue.",
                "On the subscriber side the expiration time is used to schedule the delivery of the event.",
                "If the event cannot be delivered until its expiration time it is removed from the respective queues allocated by the <br>cosmic middleware</br>.",
                "This prevents the communication system to be loaded by outdated messages.",
                "Non-real-time channels do not assume any temporal specification and disseminate events in a best effort manner.",
                "An instance of an event channel is created locally, whenever a publisher makes an announcement for publication or a subscriber subscribes for an event notification.",
                "When a publisher announces publication, the respective data structures of an event channel are created by the middleware.",
                "When a subscriber subscribes to an event channel, it may specify context attributes of an event which are used to filter events locally.",
                "E.g. a subscriber may only be interested in events generated at a certain location.",
                "Additionally the subscriber specifies quality properties of the event channel.",
                "A more detailed description of the event channels can be found in [13].",
                "Currently, COSMIC handles all event channels which disseminate events beyond the CAN network boundary as non real-time event channels.",
                "This is mainly because we use the TCP/IP protocol to disseminate events over wireless links or to the standard Ethernet.",
                "However, there are a number of possible improvements which can easily be integrated in the event channel model.",
                "The Timely Computing Base (TCB) [28] can be exploited for timing failure detection and thus would provide awareness for event dissemination in environments where timely delivery of events cannot be enforced.",
                "Additionally, there are wireless protocols which can provide timely and reliable message delivery [6, 23] which may be exploited for the respective event channel classes.",
                "Events are the information carriers which are exchanged between sentient objects through event channels.",
                "To cope with the requirements of an ad-hoc environment, an event includes the description of the context in which it has been generated and quality attributes defining requirements for dissemination.",
                "This is particularly important in an open, dynamic environment where an event may travel over multiple networks.",
                "An event instance is specified as: event := subject, context attributeList, quality attributeList, contents A subject defines the type of the event and is related to the event contents.",
                "It supports anonymous communication and is used to route an event.",
                "The subject has to match to the subject of the event channel through which the event is disseminated.",
                "Attributes are complementary to the event contents.",
                "They describe individual functional and non-functional properties of the event.",
                "The context attributes describe the environment in which the event has been generated, e.g. a location, an operational mode or a time of occurrence.",
                "The quality attributes specify timeliness and dependability aspects in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs.",
                "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent [18].",
                "As described above, the temporal validity can be mapped to a deadline.",
                "However, usually a deadline is an engineering artefact which is used for scheduling while the temporal validity is a general property of a time, value entity.",
                "In a environment where a deadline cannot be enforced, a consumer of an event eventually must decide whether the event still is temporally consistent, i.e. represents a valid time, value entity. 7.1 The Architecture of the <br>cosmic middleware</br> On the architectural level, COSMIC distinguish three layers roughly depicted in Figure 4.",
                "Two of them, the event layer and the abstract network layer are implemented by the <br>cosmic middleware</br>.",
                "The event layer provides the API for the application and realizes the abstraction of event and event channels.",
                "The abstract network implements real-time message classes and adapts the quality requirements to the underlying real network.",
                "An event channel handler resides in every node.",
                "It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication.",
                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",
                "It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14].",
                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",
                "In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus.",

                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",

                "In terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security.",

                "Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3.",
                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of <br>sentient computing</br> introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
                "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
                "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
                "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",

                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",

                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",

                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
                "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
                "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
                "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",
                "Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.",
                "Consider a platoon of cooperating vehicles.",
                "Inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] or LIN [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth.",
                "On the other hand, the vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link.",
                "Finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer.",
                "At the abstraction level of sentient objects, such heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment.",

                "The notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively defined component-based object model.",
                "A body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service container for the sentient objects inside.",
                "On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a certain CAN.",
                "A CAN defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects.",
                "In the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see Figure 1).",
                "Correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone.",
                "At the network level, the wireless network represents the respective CAN.",
                "However, several platoons united by their CANs may interact with each other and objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of WAN-of-CANs.",
                "The notions of body-environment and WAN-of-CANs are very useful when defining interaction properties across such boundaries.",
                "Their introduction obeyed to our belief that a single mechanism to provide quality measures for interactions is not appropriate.",
                "Instead, a high level construct for interaction across boundaries is needed which allows to specify the quality of dissemination and exploits the knowledge about body and environment to assess the feasibility of quality constraints.",
                "As we will see in the following section, the notion of an event channel represents this construct in our architecture.",

                "To cope with the requirements of an ad-hoc environment, an event includes the description of the context in which it has been generated and quality attributes defining requirements for dissemination.",

                "An event instance is specified as: event := subject, context attributeList, quality attributeList, contents A subject defines the type of the event and is related to the event contents.",

                "It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication.",
                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",
                "It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14].",
                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",
                "In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus.",

                "Because only a few channels are required on such a smart sensor or actuator component, the requirement of RAM (which is a scarce resource on many single chip systems) to hold the dynamic data structures of a channel is low.",

                "In terms of interaction paradigms, and although the use of event-based models appears to be a convenient solution [10, 22], these often lack the appropriate support for non-functional requirements like reliability, timeliness or security.",

                "Secondly, although the temporal behaviour of a single cluster is rigorously defined, no model to specify temporal properties for clusterto-CORBA or cluster-to-cluster interactions is provided. 3.",
                "INFORMATION FLOW AND INTERACTION MODEL In this paper we consider a component-based system model that incorporates previous work developed in the context of the IST CORTEX project [5].",
                "As mentioned above, a fundamental idea underlying the approach is that applications can be composed of a large number of smart components that are able to sense their surrounding environment and interact with it.",
                "These components are referred to as sentient objects, a metaphor elaborated in CORTEX and inspired on the generic concept of sentient computing introduced in [12].",
                "Sentient objects accept input events from a variety of different sources (including sensors, but not constrained to that), process them, and produce output events, whereby 29 they actuate on the environment and/or interact with other objects.",
                "Therefore, the following kinds of interactions can take place in the system: Environment-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information from the environment to application objects, reporting about the state of the former, and/or notifying about events taking place therein.",
                "Object-to-object interactions: correspond to a flow of information among sentient objects, serving two purposes.",
                "The first is related with complementing the assessment of each individual object about the state of the surrounding space.",
                "The second is related to collaboration, in which the object tries to influence other objects into contributing to a common goal, or into reacting to an unexpected situation.",
                "Object-to-environment interactions: correspond to a flow of information from an object to the environment, with the purpose of forcing a change in the state of the latter.",
                "Before continuing, we need to clarify a few issues with respect to these possible forms of interaction.",
                "We consider that the environment can be a producer or consumer of information while interacting with sentient objects.",
                "The environment is the real (physical) world surrounding an object, not necessarily close to the object or limited to certain boundaries.",
                "Quite clearly, the information produced by the environment corresponds to the physical representation of real-time entities, of which typical examples include temperature, distance or the state of a door.",
                "On the other hand, actuation on the environment implies the manipulation of these real-time entities, like increasing the temperature (applying more heat), changing the distance (applying some movement) or changing the state of the door (closing or opening it).",
                "The required transformations between system representations of these real-time entities and their physical representations is accomplished, generically, by sensors and actuators.",
                "We further consider that there may exist dumb sensors and actuators, which interact with the objects by disseminating or capturing raw transducer information, and smart sensors and actuators, with enhanced processing capabilities, capable of speaking some more elaborate event dialect (see Sections 5 and 6.1).",
                "Interaction with the environment is therefore done through sensors and actuators, which may, or may not be part of sentient objects, as discussed in Section 4.2.",
                "State or state changes in the environment are considered as events, captured by sensors (in the environment or within sentient objects) and further disseminated to other potentially interested sentient objects in the system.",
                "In consequence, it is quite natural to base the communication and interaction among sentient objects and with the environment on an event-based communication model.",
                "Moreover, typical properties of event-based models, such as anonymous and non-blocking communication, are highly desirable in systems where sentient objects can be mobile and where interactions are naturally very dynamic.",
                "A distinguishing aspect of our work from many of the existing approaches, is that we consider that sentient objects may indirectly communicate with each other through the environment, when they act on it.",
                "Thus the environment constitutes an interaction and communication channel and is in the control and awareness loop of the objects.",
                "In other words, when a sentient object actuates on the environment it will be able to observe the state changes in the environment by means of events captured by the sensors.",
                "Clearly, other objects might as well capture the same events, thus establishing the above-mentioned indirect communication path.",
                "In systems that involve interactions with the environment it is very important to consider the possibility of communication through the environment.",
                "It has been shown that the hidden channels developing through the latter (e.g., feedback loops) may hinder software-based algorithms ignoring them [30].",
                "Therefore, any solution to the problem requires the definition of convenient abstractions and appropriate architectural constructs.",
                "On the other hand, in order to deal with the information flow through the whole computer system and environment in a seamless way, handling software and hardware events uniformly, it is also necessary to find adequate abstractions.",
                "As discussed in Section 5, the Generic-Events Architecture introduces the concept of Generic Event and an Event Layer abstraction which aim at dealing, among others, with these issues. 4.",
                "SENTIENT OBJECT COMPOSITION In this section we analyze the most relevant issues related with the sentient object paradigm and the construction of systems composed of sentient objects. 4.1 Component-based System Construction Sentient objects can take several different forms: they can simply be software-based components, but they can also comprise mechanical and/or hardware parts, amongst which the very sensorial apparatus that substantiates sentience, mixed with software components to accomplish their task.",
                "We refine this notion by considering a sentient object as an encapsulating entity, a component with internal logic and active processing elements, able to receive, transform and produce new events.",
                "This interface hides the internal hardware/software structure of the object, which may be complex, and shields the system from the low-level functional and temporal details of controlling a specific sensor or actuator.",
                "Furthermore, given the inherent complexity of the envisaged applications, the number of simultaneous input events and the internal size of sentient objects may become too large and difficult to handle.",
                "Therefore, it should be possible to consider the hierarchical composition of sentient objects so that the application logic can be separated across as few or as many of these objects as necessary.",
                "On the other hand, composition of sentient objects should normally be constrained by the actual hardware components structure, preventing the possibility of arbitrarily composing sentient objects.",
                "This is illustrated in Figure 1, where a sentient object is internally composed of a few other sentient objects, each of them consuming and producing events, some of which only internally propagated.",
                "Observing the figure, and recalling our previous discussion about the possible interactions, we identify all of them here: an object-to-environment interaction occurs between the object controlling a WLAN transmitter and some WLAN receiver in the environment; an environment-to-object interaction takes place when the object responsible for the GPS 30 G P S r e c e p t i o n W i r e l e s s t r a n s m i s s i o n D o p p l e r r a d a r P h y s i c a l f e e d b a c k O b j e c t s b o d y I n t e r n a l N e t w o r k Figure 1: Component-aware sentient object composition. signal reception uses the information transmitted by the satellites; finally, explicit object-to-object interactions occur internally to the container object, through an internal communication network.",
                "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that implicit communication can also occur, whether the physical feedback develops through the environment internal to the container object (as depicted) or through the environment external to this object.",
                "However, there is a subtle difference between both cases.",
                "While in the former the feedback can only be perceived by objects internal to the container, bounding the extent to which consistency must be ensured, such bounds do not exist in the latter.",
                "In fact, the notion of sentient object as an encapsulating entity may serve other purposes (e.g., the confinement of feedback and of the propagation of events), beyond the mere hierarchical composition of objects.",
                "To give a more concrete example of such component-aware object composition we consider a scenario of cooperating robots.",
                "Each robot is made of several components, corresponding, for instance, to axis and manipulator controllers.",
                "Together with the control software, each of these controllers may be a sentient object.",
                "On the other hand, a robot itself is a sentient object, composed of the objects materialized by the controllers, and the environment internal to its own structure, or body.",
                "This means that it should be possible to define cooperation activities using the events produced by robot sentient objects, without the need to know the internal structure of robots, or the events produced by body objects or by smart sensors within the body.",
                "From an engineering point of view, however, this also means that robot sentient object may have to generate new events that reflect its internal state, which requires the definition of a gateway to make the bridge between the internal and external environments. 4.2 Encapsulation and Scoping Now an important question is about how to represent and disseminate events in a large scale networked world.",
                "As we have seen above, any event generated by a sentient object could, in principle, be visible anywhere in the system and thus received by any other sentient object.",
                "However, there are substantial obstacles to such universal interactions, originating from the components heterogeneity in such a largescale setting.",
                "Firstly, the components may have severe performance constraints, particularly because we want to integrate smart sensors and actuators in such an architecture.",
                "Secondly, the bandwidth of the participating networks may vary largely.",
                "Such networks may be low power, low bandwidth fieldbuses, or more powerful wireless networks as well as high speed backbones.",
                "Thirdly, the networks may have widely different reliability and timeliness characteristics.",
                "Consider a platoon of cooperating vehicles.",
                "Inside a vehicle there may be a field-bus like CAN [8, 9], TTP/A [17] or LIN [20], with a comparatively low bandwidth.",
                "On the other hand, the vehicles are communicating with others in the platoon via a direct wireless link.",
                "Finally, there may be multiple platoons of vehicles which are coordinated by an additional wireless network layer.",
                "At the abstraction level of sentient objects, such heterogeneity is reflected by the notion of body-vs-environment.",

                "The notion of body and environment is derived from the recursively defined component-based object model.",
                "A body is similar to a cell membrane and represents a quality of service container for the sentient objects inside.",
                "On the network level, it may be associated with the components coupled by a certain CAN.",
                "A CAN defines the dissemination quality which can be expected by the cooperating objects.",
                "In the above example, a vehicle may be a sentient object, whose body is composed of the respective lower level objects (sensors and actuators) which are connected by the internal network (see Figure 1).",
                "Correspondingly, the platoon can be seen itself as an object composed of a collection of cooperating vehicles, its body being the environment encapsulated by the platoon zone.",
                "At the network level, the wireless network represents the respective CAN.",
                "However, several platoons united by their CANs may interact with each other and objects further away, through some wider-range, possible fixed networking substrate, hence the concept of WAN-of-CANs.",
                "The notions of body-environment and WAN-of-CANs are very useful when defining interaction properties across such boundaries.",
                "Their introduction obeyed to our belief that a single mechanism to provide quality measures for interactions is not appropriate.",
                "Instead, a high level construct for interaction across boundaries is needed which allows to specify the quality of dissemination and exploits the knowledge about body and environment to assess the feasibility of quality constraints.",
                "As we will see in the following section, the notion of an event channel represents this construct in our architecture.",
                "It disseminates events and allows the network independent specification of quality attributes.",

                "Of course, there is still the problem to guarantee that an event will be disseminated and recognized in due time by the respective system components, but this relates to application related events rather than the low artifacts of a device timing.",

                "The quality attributes specify timeliness and dependability aspects in terms of validity interval, omission degree pairs.",
                "The validity interval defines the point in time after which an event becomes temporally inconsistent [18].",

                "Two of them, the event layer and the abstract network layer are implemented by the COSMIC middleware.",

                "It supports the programming interface and provides the necessary data structures for event-based communication.",
                "Whenever an object subscribes to a channel or a publisher announces a channel, the event channel handler is involved.",
                "It initiates the binding of the channels subject, which is represented by a network independent unique identifier to an address of the underlying abstract network to enable communication [14].",
                "The event channel handler then tightly cooperates with the respective handlers of the abstract network layer to disseminate events or receive event notifications.",
                "It should be noted that the QoS properties of the event layer in general depend on what the abstract network layer can provide.",
                "Thus, it may not always be possible to e.g. support hard real-time event channels because the abstract network layer cannot provide the respective guarantees.",
                "In [13], we describe the protocols and services of the abstract network layer particularly for the CAN-Bus.",

                "The memory footprint of COSMIC is about 13 Kbyte on a C167 and slightly more on the 68HC908 where it fits into the on-board flash memory without problems.",
                "Because only a few channels are required on such a smart sensor or actuator component, the requirement of RAM (which is a scarce resource on many single chip systems) to hold the dynamic data structures of a channel is low.",
                "The COSMIC middleware makes it very easy to include new smart sensors in an existing system.",

                "Additionally, the robots have remote subscriptions to the respective distance events which are used to check it with the local sensor readings to validate that they really follow the guide which they detect with their local sensors.",
                "Because there may be longer latencies and omissions, this check occasionally will not be possible.",
                "The unavailability of the remote events will decrease the quality of interaction and probably and slow down the robots, but will not affect safety properties. 3.",
