Hofmeyr Synovate Brand and Communications Practice Alphen Business Park Constantia 7800, South Africa jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com ABSTRACT We investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents. Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents. Local behaviour incorporates a satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the interactions between agents, including learning about the trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs. Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and negative information about products. We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models. We compare the effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures for easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.

INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17]. However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5]. The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market. While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication. Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication. In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents. In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety. Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier. In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one. The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective. These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability. An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two. The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase. These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents. Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]). Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance. We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience. Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals. The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4]. Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3]. The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models. The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome. Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour. These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all. The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices. While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]). A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12]. A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product. There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings. Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers. Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak. Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3. MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose. Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one. Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents. The intrinsic performance of 388 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi). However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)). All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings. For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings. We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering. In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t). Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly. Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage. Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product. In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used. More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ . In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1. Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them. Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1. A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents. The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik. If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k . The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k . Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products. If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random. The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α. With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product. When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers. Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents. The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones. This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections. This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right. In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems. When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying. Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad. If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals. In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral. The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse. Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity. Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration. After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ . Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using. In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section. Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively. Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij. Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied. In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups. There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent. In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent. Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition. The effect of task difficulty is evaluated on three network structures corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world network), and r = 0 (tight communities of agents), with results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time Proportionsatisfied Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (a) Proportion of agents satisfied 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 Time Shareofmarket Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Market share for leading product Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on relationship between network structure (r) and system behaviour Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time. Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition. Clearly, there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e. 390 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of information relatively independent of the ways in which connections are made. However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state. Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections. Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice. This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another. Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%. Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels. Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction. For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour. Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour. In these two tables, equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).

Firstly, there is a strong diminishing marginal return of additional connections beyond a small number. The first few connections one makes increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four. In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative satisfaction levels by less than 4%. Secondly, word-of-mouth communication continues to play an important role in improving the performance of the system even when market barriers are high. In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4). Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand. Positive referrals Negative referrals κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.21 0.93 3.27 0.00 0.00 0.00 β = 0.05 0.19 0.85 2.96 0.06 0.19 0.60 β = 0.2 0.13 0.57 2.04 0.30 0.92 2.83 β = 0.4 0.08 0.40 1.49 0.60 1.81 5.44 Table 3: Median number of positive and negative referrals made per agent per time period Perhaps the most interesting effects exerted by market barriers are those exerted over the market shares of leading products. Figure 2 shows the cumulative market share captured by the top three products in the market over time, for all types of market barriers using different degree distributions. Again, two comments can be made. Firstly, in the absence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the market is captured by the market leading products when markets are highly-connected relative to when they are poorlyconnected. This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it. Secondly, the relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers. In moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively. The Sixth Intl.

It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in negative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied agent is prevented from switching to another product, are particularly damaging to leading products when agents are well-connected, and that under moderate to strong market barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network. Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks. The reduction in the number of positive referrals as market barriers impose increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which shows the median number of product trials each agent makes per time period based on a referral from another agent. Whereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected network make substantially more reference-based product trials than agents in poorly-connected networks, when barriers are severe both types of network carry only very little positive referral information. This clearly has a relatively greater impact on the highly-connected network, which relies on the spread of positive referral information to achieve higher satisfaction levels. Moreover, this result might be even stronger in reality if agents in poorly-connected networks attempt to compensate for the relative sparcity of connections by making more forceful or persuasive referrals where they do occur. κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.13 0.27 0.35 β = 0.05 0.11 0.22 0.28 β = 0.2 0.05 0.10 0.14 β = 0.4 0.02 0.05 0.06 Table 4: Median number of referrals leading to a product trial received per agent per time period 392 The Sixth Intl.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELATED WORK Purchasing behaviour in many markets takes place on a substrate of networks of word-of-mouth communication across which agents exchange information about products and their likes and dislikes. Understanding the ways in which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents. These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs. The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour. In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world. Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure. It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving. In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight. In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share. Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case. Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in marketing systems. Naturally the usefulness of results is for the most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the two modules comprising network structure and local behaviour. On the network side, future work might investigate the relationship between degree distributions, the way connections are created and destroyed over time, whether preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger networks of more heterogenous agents. On the behavioural side, one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds during the course of communication, responses to systematic changes in product performances over time, the integration of various information sources, and different market barrier structures. All these areas provide fascinating opportunities to introduce psychological realities into models of marketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the system under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions. 6.

Durbach Departamento de Ciencias Estadísticas Universidad de Ciudad del Cabo Rondebosch 7701, Sudáfrica Ian.durbach@uct.ac.za Jan H. Hofmeyr Marca y práctica de comunicaciones de comunicaciones Alfen Constantia 7800, Sudáfrica jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com Resumen Investigamos un marco en el que los agentes buscan productos satisfactorios mediante el uso de referencias de otros agentes. Nuestro modelo de mecanismo para transmitir el boca a boca y los efectos de comportamiento resultantes se basa en integrar un módulo que rige el comportamiento local de los agentes con un módulo que rige la estructura y la función de la red subyacente de los agentes. El comportamiento local incorpora un modelo de elección satisfecho, un conjunto de reglas que rigen las interacciones entre los agentes, incluido el aprendizaje sobre la confiabilidad de otros agentes a lo largo del tiempo, y limitaciones externas sobre el comportamiento que pueden imponerse por las barreras del mercado o los costos de cambio. El comportamiento local se lleva a cabo en un sustrato de red a través del cual los agentes intercambian información positiva y negativa sobre los productos. Utilizamos varias distribuciones de grado dictando el alcance de la conectividad e incorporamos los efectos del mundo pequeño y la noción de apego preferencial en nuestros modelos de red. Comparamos la efectividad de los sistemas de referencia en varias estructuras de red para tareas de elección fácil y difícil, y evaluamos cómo esta efectividad cambia con la imposición de las barreras del mercado. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial]: Inteligencia Artificial distribuida Términos generales Rendimiento, Experimentación 1. Introducción El comportamiento de deserción, es decir, por qué las personas pueden dejar de usar un producto o servicio en particular, depende en gran medida de la afinidad psicológica o la satisfacción que sienten hacia el producto actualmente utilizado [14] y la disponibilidad de alternativas más atractivas [17]. Sin embargo, en muchos casos, la decisión sobre si desertar o no también depende de varias restricciones externas que se colocan en el comportamiento de cambio, ya sea por la estructura del mercado, por los propios proveedores (en la apariencia de contratos formales o informales),u otros llamados costos de cambio o barreras de mercado [12, 5]. La característica clave de todos estos casos es que la medida en que la afinidad psicológica juega un papel en la toma de decisiones reales está limitado por las barreras del mercado, de modo que los agentes se les impide realizar esos cursos de acción que serían más satisfactorios en un mercado sin restricciones. Si bien el nivel de satisfacción con un producto utilizado actualmente será una función de las propias experiencias del producto durante el período de uso, es probable que se obtenga el conocimiento de cualquier alternativa potencialmente más satisfactoria al aumentar la información obtenida de las experiencias personales conInformación sobre las experiencias de otros recopiladas de la comunicación casual de boca en boca. Además, existe una relación importante entre las barreras del mercado y la comunicación de boca en boca. En presencia de barreras del mercado, los agentes económicos restringidos atrapados en las relaciones insatisfactorias de los productos tenderán a difundir esta información a otros agentes. En ausencia de tales barreras, los agentes son libres de desertar de productos insatisfactorios y la comunicación de boca en boca tendería a ser de la variedad positiva. Dado que la imposición de al menos algunas formas de barreras del mercado es a menudo una decisión estratégica tomada por los proveedores de productos, estas relaciones pueden ser clave para el éxito de un proveedor en particular. Además, la relación entre las barreras del mercado y la comunicación de boca en boca puede ser recíproca. La estructura y función de la red a través de la cual se realiza la comunicación de boca en la boca, y particularmente la forma en que la red cambia en respuesta a la imposición de barreras del mercado, también juega un papel en la determinación de qué barreras del mercado son más efectivas. Estas son preguntas complejas, y nuestro principal interés en este documento es abordar los problemas más simples de investigar (a) la medida en que la estructura de la red influye en las formas en que la información se difunde en una red de tomadores de decisiones, (b) la extensión dequé barreras del mercado afectan esta difusión, y (c) las consecuentes implicaciones para el rendimiento general del sistema, en términos de la proporción de agentes que están satisfechos, y la velocidad con la que el sistema se mueve hacia el equilibrio, que calificamos la estabilidad. Un marco de modelo basado en agentes permite una investigación a nivel del tomador de decisiones individual, al 387 978-81-904262-7-7 (RPS) C 2007 IFAAMAS AL PRODUCTO, o a nivel de todo el sistema;Estamos particularmente interesados en las implicaciones de las barreras del mercado para los dos últimos. El modelo presentado aquí permite una investigación sobre los efectos de las barreras del mercado que se llevarán a cabo en un entorno complejo donde en cada período de tiempo cada agente en una población debe decidir cuál de un conjunto de productos comprar. Estas decisiones se basan en información de títulos múltiples recopilados por ensayos de productos personales, así como de las referencias de los agentes. Los agentes usan esta información reunida para buscar un producto que exceda sus umbrales de satisfacción en todos los atributos, de modo que se dice que los agentes están satisfaciendo en lugar de optimizar (por ejemplo [15]). Las barreras del mercado pueden actuar para influir en un agente para continuar utilizando un producto que ya no ofrece un rendimiento satisfactorio. Permitimos que los agentes tengan diferentes opiniones sobre el rendimiento de un producto, de modo que, como resultado, una derivación de otro agente puede no conducir a una experiencia satisfactoria. Por lo tanto, los agentes ajustan sus evaluaciones de la validez de otros referencias de agentes de acuerdo con el éxito de las referencias pasadas y usan estas evaluaciones para juzgar si utilizar o no más referencias. El nivel de satisfacción proporcionado a un agente por un producto es inherentemente dinámico, estando sujeto a fluctuaciones aleatorias en el rendimiento del producto, así como una tendencia a que un agente descarte el rendimiento de un producto que han utilizado durante mucho tiempo, un proceso similara la habituación.2. Antecedentes 2.1 Comunicación de boca en boca Gran parte del trabajo realizado sobre la comunicación de boca en boca en el contexto de la psicología social y la investigación de marketing se ha centrado en sus formas y determinantes, lo que sugiere que el boca a boca surge de tres maneras posibles:Puede ser inducido por una transacción particular o experiencia en el producto [11], particularmente cuando esa transacción ha sido especialmente buena o mala [1];Se puede solicitar de otros [10], generalmente cuando la tarea involucrada es difícil, ambigua o nueva [7];Y puede surgir cuando surge la conversación de productos y marcas en el curso de la conversación informal, particularmente cuando hay pasión por el tema [4]. Wordof-Mouth se vuelve más influyente cuando la fuente de la comunicación es creíble, con decisiones de credibilidad basadas en gran medida en una o una combinación de evaluaciones de calificación profesional, capacitación informal, distancia social [7] y similitud de puntos de vista y experiencias [3]. El papel de la comunicación de boca en boca en el comportamiento de los sistemas complejos se ha estudiado tanto en modelos analíticos como de simulación. El trabajo analítico en [8] investiga las condiciones bajo las cuales el boca a boca conduce a la conformidad en el comportamiento y la adopción de resultados socialmente eficientes (por ejemplo, elegir una alternativa que sea en promedio mejor que otra), descubriendo que la conformidad del comportamiento surge cuandoLos agentes están expuestos a la comunicación de boca en boca desde solo un pequeño número de otros agentes, pero que esta conformidad puede dar lugar a resultados socialmente ineficientes en los que la tendencia hacia la conformidad es tan fuerte que abruma la influencia de los pagos superiores proporcionados por los socialmenteResultado eficiente. Las investigaciones basadas en la simulación de Wordof-Mouth [6, 13] se han centrado en desarrollar estrategias para garantizar que un sistema alcance un nivel de equilibrio en el que todos los agentes estén satisfechos, en gran parte al aprender sobre la efectividad de otros referencias o variar el grado de inercia encomportamiento individual. Estos estudios han encontrado que, dado un número suficiente de proveedores de servicios, las referencias honestas conducen a una convergencia más rápida a distribuciones satisfactorias que las engañosas, y que ambas formas de boca a boca no proporcionan un mejor rendimiento que ninguno en absoluto. El marco de simulación permite un modelado más complejo del entorno que los modelos analíticos, en los que las referencias están al azar y solo hay dos opciones disponibles, y el trabajo en [6] en particular es un antecedente cercano del trabajo presentado en este documento, nuestra principal contribución es incluir la estructura de la red y las limitaciones impuestas por las barreras del mercado como efectos adicionales.2.2 Barreras del mercado La medida en que las barreras del mercado influyen en el comportamiento de los sistemas que atraen la atención principalmente de los economistas interesados en cómo las barreras distorsionan la competencia y los especialistas en marketing interesados en cómo las barreras distorsionan las elecciones de los consumidores. Si bien la formalización de la idea de que la satisfacción impulsa el comportamiento de compra se remonta al trabajo de Fishbein y Ajzen [9] en la elección razonada, casi todos los escritores, incluidos Fishbein y Ajzen, reconocen que esta relación puede ser frustrada por circunstancias (por ejemplo, [[17]). Una tipología útil de las barreras del mercado distingue las barreras transaccionales asociadas con el costo monetario del cambio (por ejemplo, en los servicios financieros), las barreras de aprendizaje asociadas con decidir reemplazar productos existentes conocidos y barreras contractuales que imponen limitaciones legales por el plazo del contrato [12] Una tipología diferente [5] introduce el aspecto adicional de las barreras relacionales que surgen de las relaciones personales que pueden entrelazarse con el uso de un producto en particular. En general, hay poca evidencia empírica sobre la relación entre la creación de barreras para el cambio y la retención de una base de clientes, y para lo mejor de nuestro conocimiento, ningún trabajo previo utilizando modelos basados en agentes para generar hallazgos empíricos. Burnham et al.[5] encuentran que las barreras percibidas del mercado representan casi el doble de la varianza en la intención de permanecer con un producto que el explicado por la satisfacción con el producto (30% y 16% respectivamente), y que las llamadas barreras relacionales son considerablemente más influyentes queya sea transaccional o de aprendizaje de barreras. Además, encuentran que los consumidores perciben que los costos de cambio existen incluso en mercados que son fluidos y donde las barreras parecen ser débiles. En pocas palabras, las barreras del mercado parecen desempeñar un papel más importante en lo que la gente hace que la satisfacción;y su presencia puede ser más generalizada de lo que generalmente se cree.3. Model Framework 3.1 Evaluaciones de rendimiento del producto Utilizamos una representación de problemas en la que, en cada período de tiempo, cada agente debe decidir cuál de un conjunto de productos elegir. Sea a = {ak} k = 1 ... p el conjunto de agentes, b = {bi} i = 1 ... n sea el conjunto de productos, y c = {cj} j = 1 ... mser el conjunto de atributos en los que se basará la decisión de elección, es decir, la decisión de tomar es una opción multiacribió. Deje que FJ: B → [0, 1] sea una función creciente que proporciona el rendimiento intrínseco de un producto en el atributo J (de modo que 0 y 1 son las actuaciones peores y mejores posibles respectivamente) y SIJ: A × [0,1] → [0, 1] Sea una función de opinión subjetiva de los agentes. El rendimiento intrínseco de 388 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) El producto I en el atributo J está dado por FJ (BI). Sin embargo, la opinión subjetiva del nivel de rendimiento (del producto I en el atributo j) dada por el Agente K es dada por SIJ (AK, FJ (BI)). Todo el modelado posterior se basa en estas calificaciones de rendimiento subjetivo. Para los fines de este documento, cada agente pertenece a uno de los tres grupos de tamaño igualmente, y cada grupo posee sus propias calificaciones de rendimiento subjetivo. Suponemos que los agentes no conocen las calificaciones subjetivas de rendimiento a priori, y es su tarea descubrir estas calificaciones mediante una combinación de exploración personal y reunión de referencias. Para modelar este proceso, presentamos la noción de calificaciones de rendimiento percibidas en el momento T, denotado por PIJ (AK, FJ (BI), T). Inicialmente, todas las calificaciones de rendimiento percibidas se establecen en cero, de modo que la selección inicial de un producto se realiza al azar. La variación posterior en el rendimiento del producto a lo largo del tiempo se modela utilizando dos cantidades: una perturbación aleatoria que JKT aplicada en cada ocasión de compra asegura que la experiencia de un producto en particular pueda variar en las ocasiones de compra para el mismo agente, y un factor de descuento de habituación tiende a disminuir laEl rendimiento percibido de un producto con el tiempo a medida que el aburrimiento se arrastra con el uso repetido. Nuestro mecanismo de habituación supone que la habituación se acumula con el uso repetido de un producto, y se utiliza para descartar el rendimiento del producto. En la mayoría de los casos, es decir, a menos que el factor de habituación sea uno o extremadamente cercano a uno, este descuento basado en habituación finalmente conduce a la deserción, después de lo cual el nivel de habituación se disipa a medida que pasa el tiempo sin que se use el producto. Más formalmente, una vez que un producto I ∗ ha sido elegido por el Agente K, se percibe el nivel subjetivo de rendimiento y PI ∗ J (AK, FJ (B ∗ I), T) se establece igual a Si ∗ J (AK, FJ ((b ∗ i)) HI ∗ KT + JKT, donde JKT se distribuye como n (0, σ) y Hi ∗ Kt es una función decreciente del número de períodos de tiempo al que el agente K ha sido expuesto a I ∗. Al evaluar el rendimiento de un producto, los agentes hacen uso de un marco de satisfacción al comparar el rendimiento percibido del producto elegido con sus umbrales de satisfacción γk = {G1K ,..., GMK}, con 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1. El agente K estará satisfecho con un producto i ∗ seleccionado en el tiempo t si pi ∗ j (ak, fj (b ∗ i), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j.3.2 Procesos de decisión En el diseño del mecanismo por el cual los agentes toman sus decisiones de elección, permitimos la posibilidad de que los agentes satisfechos defecten los productos que actualmente los satisfacen. Los agentes satisfechos se mantienen con su producto actual con probabilidad PR (estadía), con una estrategia que prohíbe a los agentes satisfechos moverse (por ejemplo [6]) obtenido como un caso especial cuando PR (estadía) = 1. Un agente satisfecho de defectos decide qué producto elegir al considerar todos los demás productos para los cuales tiene información, ya sea por exploración personal previa o por referencias de otros agentes. La selección de un nuevo producto comienza por el agente que identifica aquellos productos de los cuales él o ella espera obtener un rendimiento satisfactorio en todos los atributos, es decir, aquellos productos para los cuales ΔIK <0, donde ΔIK = maxj [gjk - pij (AK, FJ (BI (BI (Bi), t)], y seleccionando un producto de este conjunto con probabilidades de selección proporcionales a −ΔIK. Si no existe un producto satisfactorio (o al menos el agente desconoce ningún producto), el agente identifica aquellos productos que ofrecen al menos un nivel mínimo de rendimiento aceptable γ− k. El nivel mínimo de aceptabilidad se define como la desviación máxima de sus aspiraciones en todos los atributos que el agente está dispuesto a aceptar, es decir, un producto es mínimamente aceptable si y solo si δik <γ− k. Los agentes luego seleccionan un producto al azar del conjunto de productos mínimamente aceptables. Si el conjunto de productos mínimamente aceptables está vacío, los agentes seleccionan un producto del conjunto completo de productos B al azar. El proceso de decisión seguido de agentes insatisfechos es en gran medida similar al de los agentes satisfechos de defecto, con la excepción de que al comienzo del proceso de decisión, los agentes elegirán explorar un nuevo producto, elegido al azar del conjunto de productos restantes, con probabilidad α. Con la probabilidad 1 - α, utilizarán un proceso de decisión como el descrito anteriormente para agentes satisfechos.3.3 Las restricciones en los procesos de decisión en algunas circunstancias pueden existir barreras del mercado que dificultan el cambio entre los productos, particularmente cuando se incurren en algunos costos de cambio como resultado de la elección cambiante del producto. Cuando están presentes las barreras, los agentes no cambian cuando quedan insatisfechos, sino solo cuando la evaluación del rendimiento cae por debajo de algún nivel crítico, es decir, cuando ΔIK> β, donde β> 0 mide la fuerza de las barreras del mercado. Aunque en este documento las barreras del mercado no varían sobre los productos o el tiempo, es sencillo permitir que esto ocurra permitiendo que las barreras tomen la forma general β = max (β ∗ +Δtuse, β ∗), donde β ∗ es una barrera para la deserciónEso se aplica cuando el producto se compra por primera vez (por ejemplo, un acuerdo contractual), δ es el aumento de las barreras que se incurren para cada período de tiempo adicional para el que se usa el producto y β ∗ es la barrera máxima posible y todoSe permite que tres cantidades varíen sobre los productos, es decir, ser una función de i.3.4 Procesos de referencia Se supone que cada agente está conectado a los agentes QK <P, es decir, para dar y recibir información de QK Otros agentes. La red sobre la cual viaja de comunicación de boca en boca se rige por el efecto pequeño del mundo [18], por el cual las redes exhiben simultáneamente un alto grado de agrupación de agentes en comunidades y una longitud de ruta promedio corta entre dos agentes en la redy adjunto preferencial [2], por el cual los agentes con un mayor número de conexiones existentes tienen más probabilidades de recibir otras nuevas. Esto se logra fácilmente construyendo una red unidimensional con conexiones entre todos los pares de agentes separados por κ o menos espacios de red, y creando una red de mundo pequeño eligiendo al azar una pequeña fracción R de las conexiones en la red y moviendo un extremode cada uno a un nuevo agente, con ese nuevo agente elegido con probabilidad proporcional a su número de conexiones existentes. Esto da como resultado una distribución del número de conexiones poseídas por cada agente, es decir, una distribución de QK, que está fuertemente sesgada hacia la derecha. De hecho, si la construcción de la red se modifica ligeramente para que se agregan nuevas conexiones con un archivo adjunto preferencial (pero no se eliminan las conexiones), la distribución de QK sigue una distribución de la ley de potencia, pero una distribución con una probabilidad no cero deUn agente que tiene menos que el número modal de conexiones parece más realista en el contexto de la comunicación de boca en boca en los sistemas de marketing. Cuando un agente compra un producto, informa a cada uno de los otros agentes en su círculo con probabilidad igual a PR (SPR) K ∗ + | ΔIK ∗ |, donde PR (SPR) K ∗ es la propensión básica del agente K ∗ extenderpalabra de boca y Δik ∗ captura el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 389. Por lo tanto, los agentes tienen más probabilidades de difundir el boca a boca sobre los productos que acaban de experimentar como muy buenos o muy malos. Si un agente recibe información sobre el mismo producto de más de un agente, él o ella selecciona la derivación de solo uno de estos agentes, con probabilidades de selección proporcionales a TT (K ∗, K), el grado en que las referencias anteriores de K ∗a K tuvieron éxito, es decir, dio como resultado experiencias satisfactorias para el Agente K.Por lo tanto, los agentes tienen la capacidad de aprender sobre la calidad de los referencias de otros agentes y usar esta información para aceptar o bloquear las referencias futuras. En este artículo, empleamos una condición de aprendizaje en la que TT (K ∗, K) se multiplica por un factor de 0.1 que sigue una referencia insatisfactoria y un factor de 3 que sigue una referencia satisfactoria. La asimetría en la ponderación es similar a la empleada en [16], y está motivada por el hecho de que es probable que una derivación insatisfactoria sea evidencia más confiable de que un agente de referencia K ∗ no posee las mismas preferencias subjetivas que un Agente KLa referencia positiva es indicar lo contrario. Otro proceso de referencia es ciertamente posible, por ejemplo, una integración de múltiples fuentes de boca a boca en lugar de elegir solo la fuente más absorbida: nuestra razón principal para emplear el proceso descrito anteriormente es la simplicidad. La integración de diferentes fuentes complica considerablemente el proceso de aprendizaje sobre la confiabilidad de los demás y plantea más preguntas sobre la naturaleza precisa de la integración. Después de determinar quién contacta a quién, la referencia real se modela como una transmitancia de información sobre el nivel percibido de rendimiento de una experiencia de producto I ∗ del agente de referencia K ∗ al agente aceptable k, es decir, pi ∗ j (ak, fj (bi (bi), t) adquiere el valor Pi ∗ J (Ak ∗, FJ (Bi), T - 1), ∀j, siempre que el Agente K no esté usando I ∗. La información sobre otros productos no se transmite, y un agente ignorará cualquier boca a boca sobre el producto que está utilizando actualmente. En efecto, la referencia crea un nivel de rendimiento esperado en la mente de un agente aceptable para el producto mencionado, al que ese agente puede usar al tomar una decisión de elección en períodos de tiempo posteriores utilizando los procesos de decisión descritos en la sección anterior. Una vez que un agente ha experimentado personalmente un producto, cualquier nivel de rendimiento esperado sugerido por referencias anteriores se reemplaza por los niveles experimentados (subjetivos) de rendimiento SIJ (AK, FJ (BI)) + JKT y TT (K ∗, K) se ajusta dependiendo desi la experiencia fue satisfactoria o no.4. Resultados experimentales Examinamos el comportamiento de un sistema de 200 agentes que consta de tres grupos de 67, 67 y 66 agentes respectivamente. Los agentes en cada uno de los tres grupos tienen funciones de opinión subjetivas homogéneas sij. Las simulaciones se ejecutaron durante 500 períodos de tiempo, y se usaron veinte repeticiones de cada condición para generar resultados agregados.4.1 Dificultad de tarea de elección Comenzamos examinando el efecto de la dificultad de la tarea sobre la capacidad de varias configuraciones de red para converger a un estado en el que se satisface una proporción aceptable de la población. En la condición de elección fácil, hay 50 productos para elegir en el mercado, evaluados más de 4 atributos con todos los umbrales de satisfacción establecidos en 0.5 para todos los grupos. Por lo tanto, hay en promedio aproximadamente 3 productos que se puede esperar que satisfagan cualquier agente en particular. En la condición de elección difícil, hay 500 productos para elegir en el mercado, todavía evaluados más de 4 atributos, pero con todos los umbrales de satisfacción ahora establecidos en 0.7 para todos los grupos, por lo que en promedio hay aproximadamente 4 productos que se pueden esperar que satisfagan cualquieragente particular. La ubicación de un producto satisfactorio es mucho más difícil bajo la condición dura. El efecto de la dificultad de la tarea se evalúa en tres estructuras de red correspondientes a r = 1 (red aleatoria), r = 0.05 (red de mundo pequeño) y r = 0 (comunidades estrechas de agentes), con resultados que se muestran en la Figura 1 para elCaso de κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Proporciones de tiempo Satisfecha Tarea fácil R = 1 R = 0.05 R = 0 (a) Proporción de agentes satisfecho 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.20.30.40.50.6 tiempo compartir el mercado de la tarea fácil r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Cuota de mercado para el producto líder Figura 1: Efecto moderador de la dificultad de la tarea en la relación entre la estructura de la red (R) y el comportamiento del sistema dado una tarea relativamente fácil,El sistema muy rápidamente, es decir, en poco más de 50 períodos de tiempo, converge a un estado en el que menos del 60% de los agentes están satisfechos en cualquier momento. Además, las diferentes estructuras de red tienen muy poca influencia en los resultados, de modo que solo se proporciona una sola serie (suavizada) para comparar con la condición dura. Claramente, hay suficientes agentes que resuelven independientemente la tarea, es decir, 390 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), encontrar una marca satisfactoria, para hacer que la difusión de la información sea relativamente independiente de las formas en que se realizan las conexiones. Sin embargo, cuando es más difícil localizar un producto satisfactorio, la estructura de la red se vuelve integral a la velocidad a la que el sistema converge a un estado estable. Es importante destacar que el nivel de satisfacción general al que el sistema converge permanece justo por debajo del 60%, independientemente de qué estructura de red se use, pero la convergencia se acelera considerablemente por el cableado aleatorio de incluso una pequeña proporción de conexiones. Por lo tanto, mientras la red aleatoria (r = 1) converge más rápido, la red de mundo pequeño (r = 0.05) también muestra una mejora sustancial sobre las comunidades estrictas representadas por la red de anillo unidimensional. Este efecto del parámetro R-cableado R es mucho menos pronunciado para las redes más altamente conectadas (por ejemplo, κ = 9), lo que sugiere que la distribución de grado de una red es un determinante más importante del comportamiento del sistema que la forma en que los agentes están conectados aunos y otros. Se observan resultados similares cuando se observan la cuota de mercado alcanzada por el producto líder del mercado bajo cada nivel de dificultad de elección: la participación de mercado es esencialmente independiente de la estructura de red para la tarea fácil, con una participación promedio que converge rápidamente a alrededor del 35%. Establecer una tarea más difícil, la convergencia de la cuota de mercado a un equilibrio aproximado a largo plazo es, de hecho, más rápida para la red del mundo pequeño, con las redes comunitarias aleatorias y estrechas tomando diferentes caminos, pero momentos similares para alcanzar sus niveles de equilibrio. También es interesante el hallazgo de que las cuotas de mercado de equilibrio para el líder del mercado parecen ser ligeramente (del orden del 5-10%) más altas cuando las conexiones de la red no son aleatorias: la red aleatoria parece sufrir más de los efectos de la habitatación que la de la habitatación que lasOtras redes como resultado de la rápida adopción temprana del producto líder del mercado.4.2 Barreras de mercado En el resto de este documento, nos centramos en el efecto de varias formas de barreras del mercado sobre la capacidad de un sistema de agentes para alcanzar un estado de satisfacción aceptable. Para simplificar, nos concentramos en el conjunto más pequeño de 50 productos, es decir, la tarea de elección fácil discutida anteriormente, pero variamos el número de conexiones con la que cada agente comienza para investigar simultáneamente el efecto de la distribución de grado en el comportamiento del sistema. Las tablas 1 y 2 muestran el efecto de diferentes distribuciones de grado en la proporción de equilibrio de agentes que se satisfacen en cualquier momento, y la proporción de equilibrio de agentes que cambian de productos (mudán) en cualquier período de tiempo, bajo varios niveles de barreras de mercado que limitan suscomportamiento. En estas dos tablas, los resultados de equilibrio se han calculado promediando los períodos de tiempo 450 a 500, cuando el sistema está en equilibrio o extremadamente cercano al equilibrio (la Tabla 3 y 4 utilizan todos los períodos de tiempo). No WOM κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.27 0.44 0.56 0.58 β = 0.05 0.26 0.39 0.50 0.52 β = 0.2 0.14 0.27 0.32 0.34 β = 0.4 0.07 0.17 0.22 0.25 Tabla 1: Efecto de la distribución de grado y barreros de mercado en sobreproporción del mercado satisfecho no WOM κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.74 0.51 0.45 0.45 β = 0.05 0.66 0.43 0.38 0.37 β = 0.2 0.41 0.21 0.21 0.21 β = 0.4 0.17 0.09 0.09 0.09 Tabla 2: Efecto de distribución de grado Distribución de grado Distribución de grado Distribucióny vale la pena señalar las barreras del mercado en la proporción de que el mercado mueve tres aspectos. En primer lugar, hay un fuerte retorno marginal decreciente de conexiones adicionales más allá de un pequeño número. Las primeras conexiones que uno hace aumenta la probabilidad de encontrar un producto satisfactorio 60% de 0.27 a 0.44 (para los dos primeros contactos), seguido de un aumento adicional de aproximadamente 25% a 0.56 para los siguientes cuatro. En contraste, agregar otros 12 contactos mejora los niveles de satisfacción relativa en menos del 4%. En segundo lugar, la comunicación de boca en boca continúa desempeñando un papel importante en la mejora del rendimiento del sistema, incluso cuando las barreras del mercado son altas. De hecho, el rol puede incluso ser más importante en condiciones limitadas, ya que las ganancias relativas obtenidas de boca en boca son mayores que son las barreras más altas del mercado, solo tener dos contactos más que dobles el nivel de satisfacción agregado bajo las barreras más extremas (β = 0.4). Finalmente, está claro que el mecanismo por el cual las barreras reducen la satisfacción es restringir el movimiento (reflejado en la menor proporción de agentes que se mueven en cualquier columna particular de las Tablas 1 y 2), pero eso aumenta en la Ley de distribución de grados para aumentar precisamente elEl mismo mecanismo para reducir el movimiento: esta vez al reducir la cantidad promedio de tiempo requerido para encontrar una marca satisfactoria.

La Figura 2 muestra la cuota de mercado acumulada capturada por los tres principales productos del mercado a lo largo del tiempo, para todo tipo de barreras del mercado utilizando distribuciones de diferentes grados. Nuevamente, se pueden hacer dos comentarios. En primer lugar, en ausencia de barreras del mercado, la mayor proporción del mercado es capturada por los productos líderes en el mercado cuando los mercados están altamente conectados en relación con cuando están poco conectados. Esta diferencia puede ascender hasta un 15%, y se explica por la retroalimentación positiva dentro de las redes más altamente controladas que sirven para aumentar la probabilidad de que, una vez que hayan surgido un conjunto de productos satisfactorios, se mantenga informado sobre estos productos principales porque al menosUno de los contactos es usarlo. En segundo lugar, la cuota de mercado relativamente más alta que disfruta de los líderes del mercado en redes altamente conectadas está erosionada por las barreras del mercado. Al pasar de β = 0 a β = 0.2 a β = 0.4, los líderes del mercado pierden colectivamente una participación absoluta de 15% y 10% en las distribuciones de mayor grado κ = 9 y κ = 3 respectivamente.

Parece razonable sugerir que los aumentos en el boca a boca negativo, que ocurre cuando se evita que un agente insatisfecho cambie a otro producto, son particularmente dañinos para los productos líderes cuando los agentes están bien conectados, y que bajo barreras de mercado moderadas a fuertesEstos efectos más que compensan cualquier ganancia logrado por la propagación de la boca de boca positiva a través de la red. La Tabla 3 muestra el número de referencias intentadas, tanto positivas como negativas, en función de la distribución de grado y el alcance de las barreras del mercado, y muestra que las barreras de mercado más fuertes actúan para deprimir simultáneamente la comunicación positiva de boca en boca y aumentar la comunicación negativa de los atrapados en insatisfactoriosRelaciones de productos, y que este efecto es particularmente pronunciado para redes más conectadas. La reducción en el número de referencias positivas a medida que las barreras del mercado imponen restricciones cada vez más severas también se refleja en la Tabla 4, que muestra el número medio de ensayos de productos que cada agente realiza por período de tiempo basado en una referencia de otro agente. Mientras que bajo pocas o ninguna barrera, los agentes en una red altamente conectada hacen sustancialmente más ensayos de productos basados en referencia que los agentes en redes mal conectadas, cuando las barreras son graves que ambos tipos de red tienen muy poca información de referencia positiva. Esto claramente tiene un impacto relativamente mayor en la red altamente conectada, que se basa en la propagación de información de referencia positiva para lograr niveles de satisfacción más altos. Además, este resultado podría ser aún más fuerte en la realidad si los agentes en las redes mal conectadas intentan compensar la relativa escasez de las conexiones haciendo referencias más contundentes o persuasivas donde ocurren.κ = 1 κ = 3 κ = 9 β = 0 0.13 0.27 0.35 β = 0.05 0.11 0.22 0.28 β = 0.2 0.05 0.10 0.14 β = 0.4 0.02 0.05 0.06 Tabla 4: Número medio de referencias que conducen a un ensayo de producto recibido por agente por tiempoPeríodo 392 El sexto intl.

Conclusiones y el comportamiento de compra de trabajo relacionado en muchos mercados se llevan a cabo en un sustrato de redes de comunicación de boca en boca a través de la cual los agentes intercambian información sobre productos y sus gustos y disgustos. Comprender las formas en que los flujos de la comunicación de boca en boca influyen en el comportamiento del mercado agregado requieren que uno estudie tanto las propiedades estructurales subyacentes de la red como las reglas locales que rigen el comportamiento de los agentes en la red al tomar decisiones de compra e interactuar con otrosagentes. Estas reglas locales a menudo están limitadas por la naturaleza de un mercado en particular, o de lo contrario impuestas por proveedores estratégicos o costumbres sociales. El modelado adecuado de un mecanismo para la transmisión de boca en boca y los efectos conductuales resultantes requiere una consideración de una serie de componentes complejos e interactuantes: redes de comunicación, credibilidad de origen, procesos de aprendizaje, habituación y memoria, limitaciones externas en el comportamiento, teoríasde transferencia de información y comportamiento adaptativo. En este artículo hemos intentado abordar algunos de estos problemas de una manera que refleja cómo los agentes podrían actuar en el mundo real. Utilizando las nociones clave de una red de comunicación limitada, un proceso de aprendizaje simple y una heurística satisfactoria que puede estar sujeta a limitaciones externas, mostramos (1) la importancia de la comunicación de boca en boca tanto a la efectividad y estabilidad del sistema (2 (2 (2) que la distribución de grado de una red es más influyente que la forma en que los agentes están conectados, pero que ambos son importantes en entornos más complejos, (3) que reencuentro incluso un pequeño número de conexiones para crear una red de mundo pequeño puede haberResultados dramáticos para la velocidad de convergencia a las distribuciones de satisfacción y las asignaciones de participación de mercado, (4) que el boca a boca sigue siendo efectivo cuando los movimientos entre los productos están limitados por las barreras del mercado, y (5) que aumenta en la palabra negativaLa boca incurrida como resultado de las barreras del mercado puede reducir la cuota de mercado capturada colectivamente por las marcas líderes, pero que esto depende de la existencia de una estructura de red adecuadamente bien conectada. Es el hallazgo final que es probable que sea más sorprendente y prácticamente relevante para el campo de la investigación de marketing, y sugiere que no siempre es lo mejor para un líder del mercado imponer barreras que evitan que los clientes se van. En las redes mal conectadas, el efecto de las barreras en las cuotas de mercado es leve. En contraste, en las redes bien conectadas, el boca a boca negativo puede evitar que los agentes prueben un producto que de otro modo podrían haber encontrado satisfactorio, y esto puede infligir daños significativos en la participación de mercado. Los productos con una pequeña participación de mercado (que, en el contexto de nuestras simulaciones, generalmente se deben a que el producto ofrece un bajo rendimiento) no se ven afectados por el boca a boca negativo, ya que es probable que la mayoría de los ensayos de productos no sean insatisfactorios en cualquier caso. El modelado basado en agentes proporciona una forma natural para comenzar a investigar los tipos de dinámica que ocurren en los sistemas de marketing. Naturalmente, la utilidad de los resultados depende en su mayor parte de la calidad del modelado de los dos módulos que comprenden la estructura de la red y el comportamiento local. En el lado de la red, el trabajo futuro podría investigar la relación entre las distribuciones de grados, la forma en que se crean y destruyen las conexiones con el tiempo, ya sea que el apego preferencial sea influyente y la medida en que la identidad social informa la estructura de la red, todas en redes más grandes de agentes más heterogéneos. En el lado del comportamiento, uno podría analizar la adaptación de los umbrales de satisfacción durante el curso de la comunicación, las respuestas a los cambios sistemáticos en el rendimiento del producto a lo largo del tiempo, la integración de varias fuentes de información y diferentes estructuras de barrera del mercado. Todas estas áreas brindan oportunidades fascinantes para introducir realidades psicológicas en modelos de sistemas de marketing y observar el comportamiento resultante del sistema bajo descripciones de escenarios cada vez más realistas.6.

        "Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents.",
        "Local behaviour incorporates a satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the interactions between agents, including learning about the trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs.",
        "Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and negative information about products.",
        "We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models.",
        "We compare the effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures for easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence General Terms Performance, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
        "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
        "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
        "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
        "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
        "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
        "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
        "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
        "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
        "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
        "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
        "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
        "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
        "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
        "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
        "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
        "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
        "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
        "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
        "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
        "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
        "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
        "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
        "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
        "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
        "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
        "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
        "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
        "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
        "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
        "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
        "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
        "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
        "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
        "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",
        "The intrinsic performance of 388 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
        "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
        "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
        "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
        "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
        "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
        "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
        "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
        "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
        "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
        "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
        "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
        "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
        "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
        "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
        "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
        "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
        "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
        "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
        "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
        "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
        "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
        "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
        "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
        "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
        "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
        "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
        "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying.",
        "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
        "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
        "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
        "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
        "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
        "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
        "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
        "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
        "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
        "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.",
        "Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij.",
        "Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied.",
        "In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.",
        "There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
        "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
        "Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition.",
        "The effect of task difficulty is evaluated on three network structures corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world network), and r = 0 (tight communities of agents), with results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time Proportionsatisfied Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (a) Proportion of agents satisfied 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 Time Shareofmarket Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Market share for leading product Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on relationship between network structure (r) and system behaviour Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.",
        "Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition.",
        "Clearly, there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e. 390 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of information relatively independent of the ways in which connections are made.",
        "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
        "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
        "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
        "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
        "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
        "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
        "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
        "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.",
        "In these two tables, equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).",

        "Firstly, there is a strong diminishing marginal return of additional connections beyond a small number.",
        "The first few connections one makes increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.",
        "In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative satisfaction levels by less than 4%.",
        "Secondly, word-of-mouth communication continues to play an important role in improving the performance of the system even when market barriers are high.",
        "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
        "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

        "Again, two comments can be made.",
        "Firstly, in the absence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the market is captured by the market leading products when markets are highly-connected relative to when they are poorlyconnected.",
        "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",
        "Secondly, the relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers.",
        "In moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively.",

        "It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in negative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied agent is prevented from switching to another product, are particularly damaging to leading products when agents are well-connected, and that under moderate to strong market barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network.",
        "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",
        "The reduction in the number of positive referrals as market barriers impose increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which shows the median number of product trials each agent makes per time period based on a referral from another agent.",
        "Whereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected network make substantially more reference-based product trials than agents in poorly-connected networks, when barriers are severe both types of network carry only very little positive referral information.",

        "Understanding the ways in which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents.",
        "These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs.",
        "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
        "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
        "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
        "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
        "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
        "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
        "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",
        "Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in marketing systems.",
        "Naturally the usefulness of results is for the most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the two modules comprising network structure and local behaviour.",
        "On the network side, future work might investigate the relationship between degree distributions, the way connections are created and destroyed over time, whether preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger networks of more heterogenous agents.",
        "On the behavioural side, one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds during the course of communication, responses to systematic changes in product performances over time, the integration of various information sources, and different market barrier structures.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",

                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",

                "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",
                "Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in marketing systems.",
                "Naturally the usefulness of results is for the most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the two modules comprising network structure and local behaviour.",
                "On the network side, future work might investigate the relationship between degree distributions, the way connections are created and destroyed over time, whether preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger networks of more heterogenous agents.",
                "On the behavioural side, one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds during the course of communication, responses to systematic changes in product performances over time, the integration of various information sources, and different market barrier structures.",
                "All these areas provide fascinating opportunities to introduce psychological realities into models of marketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the system under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions. 6.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
                "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k.

                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",

                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",

                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual <br>word-of-mouth communication</br>.",

                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> Much of the work done on <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",

                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",

                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",

                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Understanding the ways in which flows of <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents.",
                "These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs.",
                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of <br>word-of-mouth communication</br> to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",

                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",

[5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",

                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in <br>marketing system</br>s.",

                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",

                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "INTRODUCTION <br>defection behaviour</br>, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",

                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which <br>psychological affinity</br> plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",

                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",

                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",

                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "Understanding the ways in which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents.",
                "These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs.",
                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on <br>switching behaviour</br>, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",

                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",

Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",

                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",
                "Secondly, the relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

Hofmeyr Synovate Brand and Communications Practice Alphen Business Park Constantia 7800, South Africa jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com ABSTRACT We investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents.",
                "Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An <br>agent-based model</br> framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
                "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying.",
                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.",
                "Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij.",
                "Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied.",
                "In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.",
                "There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition.",
                "The effect of task difficulty is evaluated on three network structures corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world network), and r = 0 (tight communities of agents), with results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time Proportionsatisfied Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (a) Proportion of agents satisfied 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 Time Shareofmarket Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Market share for leading product Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on relationship between network structure (r) and system behaviour Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.",
                "Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition.",
                "Clearly, there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e. 390 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of information relatively independent of the ways in which connections are made.",
                "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "Understanding the ways in which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents.",
                "These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs.",
                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of <br>social psychology</br> and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",

                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",

                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",

Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",

                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",

                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

Hofmeyr Synovate Brand and Communications Practice Alphen Business Park Constantia 7800, South Africa jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com ABSTRACT We investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents.",
                "Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents.",
                "Local behaviour incorporates a satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the interactions between agents, including learning about the trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs.",
                "Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and negative information about products.",
                "We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
                "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying.",
                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.",
                "Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij.",
                "Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied.",
                "In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.",
                "There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition.",

                "Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition.",

                "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",

                "In these two tables, equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",
                "Secondly, the relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers.",
                "In moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",

                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort <br>consumer choice</br>s.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",

                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",

                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",

                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",

                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",
                "Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in marketing systems.",
                "Naturally the usefulness of results is for the most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the two modules comprising network structure and local behaviour.",
                "On the network side, future work might investigate the relationship between degree distributions, the way connections are created and destroyed over time, whether preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger networks of more heterogenous agents.",
                "On the behavioural side, one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds during the course of communication, responses to systematic changes in product performances over time, the integration of various information sources, and different market barrier structures.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called <br>switching cost</br>s or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that <br>switching cost</br>s are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",

                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some <br>switching cost</br>s are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",

Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",

                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",

                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

Hofmeyr Synovate Brand and Communications Practice Alphen Business Park Constantia 7800, South Africa jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com ABSTRACT We investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents.",
                "Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents.",
                "Local behaviour incorporates a satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the interactions between agents, including learning about the trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs.",
                "Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and negative information about products.",
                "We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models.",
                "We compare the effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures for easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence General Terms Performance, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",
                "The intrinsic performance of 388 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
                "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying.",
                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.",
                "Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij.",
                "Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied.",
                "In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.",
                "There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition.",
                "The effect of task difficulty is evaluated on three network structures corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world network), and r = 0 (tight communities of agents), with results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time Proportionsatisfied Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (a) Proportion of agents satisfied 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 Time Shareofmarket Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Market share for leading product Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on relationship between network structure (r) and system behaviour Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.",
                "Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition.",
                "Clearly, there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e. 390 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of information relatively independent of the ways in which connections are made.",
                "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",
                "Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.",
                "In these two tables, equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).",

                "Firstly, there is a strong diminishing marginal return of additional connections beyond a small number.",
                "The first few connections one makes increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.",
                "In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative satisfaction levels by less than 4%.",
                "Secondly, word-of-mouth communication continues to play an important role in improving the performance of the system even when market barriers are high.",
                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",

                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",

                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",

                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",

                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",

                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",

Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",

                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",

                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",

Hofmeyr Synovate Brand and Communications Practice Alphen Business Park Constantia 7800, South Africa jn.hofmeyr@iafrica.com ABSTRACT We investigate a framework where agents search for satisfying products by using referrals from other agents.",
                "Our model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a module governing the local behaviour of agents with a module governing the structure and function of the underlying network of agents.",
                "Local behaviour incorporates a satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the interactions between agents, including learning about the trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or switching costs.",
                "Local behaviour takes place on a network substrate across which agents exchange positive and negative information about products.",
                "We use various degree distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential attachment in our network models.",

                "INTRODUCTION Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop using a particular product or service, largely depends on the psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more attractive alternatives [17].",
                "However, in many cases the decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on various external constraints that are placed on switching behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts), or other so-called switching costs or market barriers [12, 5].",
                "The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.",
                "While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used product will largely be a function of ones own experiences of the product over the period of use, knowledge of any potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained by augmenting the information gained from personal experiences with information about the experiences of others gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication.",
                "Moreover, there is an important relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication.",
                "In the presence of market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this information to other agents.",
                "In the absence of such barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be of the positive variety.",
                "Since the imposition of at least some forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the success of a particular supplier.",
                "In addition, the relationship between market barriers and word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one.",
                "The structure and function of the network across which word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the way in which the network changes in response to the imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining which market barriers are most effective.",
                "These are complex questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which network structure influences the ways in which information is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination, and (c) the consequent implications for overall system performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards equilibrium, which we term stability.",
                "An agent-based model framework allows for an investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the 387 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for the latter two.",
                "The model presented here allows for an investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried out in a complex environment where at every time period each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of products to purchase.",
                "These decisions are based on multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as well as from the referrals of agents.",
                "Agents use this gathered information to search for a product that exceeds their satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).",
                "Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory performance.",
                "We allow agents to hold different opinions about the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.",
                "Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of other agents referrals according to the success of past referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not to make use of any further referrals.",
                "The level of satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount the performance of a product they have used for a long time - a process akin to habituation. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND 2.1 Word-of-mouth communication Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication in the context of social psychology and marketing research has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11], particularly when that transaction has been an especially good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10], usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and brands arise in the course of informal conversation, particularly when a passion for the subject is present [4].",
                "Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the communication is credible, with credibility decisions based largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and similarity of views and experiences [3].",
                "The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and simulation models.",
                "The analytical work in [8] investigates the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication from only a small number of other agents, but that this conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially efficient outcome.",
                "Simulation-based investigations of wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the effectiveness of others referrals or by varying the degree of inertia in individual behaviour.",
                "These studies have found that, given a sufficient number of service providers, honest referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth provide better performance than none at all.",
                "The simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the environment than the analytical models, in which referrals are at random and only two choices are available, and the work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include network structure and the constraints imposed by market barriers as additional effects. 2.2 Market barriers The extent to which market barriers are influential in affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from economists interested in how barriers distort competition and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer choices.",
                "While the formalisation of the idea that satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).",
                "A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes transactional barriers associated with the monetary cost of changing (e.g. in financial services), learning barriers associated with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and contractual barriers imposing legal constraints for the term of the contract [12].",
                "A different typology [5] introduces the additional aspect of relational barriers arising from personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of a particular product.",
                "There is generally little empirical evidence on the relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate empirical findings.",
                "Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in intention to stay with a product than that explained by satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and that so-called relational barriers are considerably more influential than either transactional or learning barriers.",
                "Further, they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers would seem to be weak.",
                "Simply put, market barriers appear to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction; and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally thought. 3.",
                "MODEL FRAMEWORK 3.1 Product performance evaluations We use a problem representation in which, at each time period, every agent must decide which one of a set of products to choose.",
                "Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents, B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice one.",
                "Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective opinion function of agents.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi).",
                "However, the subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).",
                "All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective performance ratings.",
                "For the purposes of this paper, each agent belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group possessing its own subjective performance ratings.",
                "We assume that the subjective performance ratings are not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration and referral gathering.",
                "In order to model this process we introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t).",
                "Initially, all perceived performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a product is done randomly.",
                "Subsequent variation in product performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in with repeated usage.",
                "Our habituation mechanism supposes that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product, and is used to discount the performance of the product.",
                "In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting eventually leads to defection, after which the level of habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being used.",
                "More formally, once a product i∗ has been chosen by agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ))Hi∗kt + jkt, where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has been exposed to i∗ .",
                "In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1.",
                "Agent k will be satisfied with a product i∗ selected in time t if pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗ i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j. 3.2 Decision processes In designing the mechanism by which agents make their choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying them.",
                "Satisfied agents stay with their current product with probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when Pr(stay) = 1.",
                "A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to choose by considering all other products for which it has information, either by previous personal exploration or by referrals from other agents.",
                "The selection of a new product begins by the agent identifying those products from which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to −δik.",
                "If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those products that offer at least a minimum level of acceptable performance γ− k .",
                "The minimum level of acceptability is defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e. a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ− k .",
                "Agents then select a product at random from the set of minimally acceptable products.",
                "If the set of minimally acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full set of products B at random.",
                "The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the set of remaining products, with probability α.",
                "With probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one outlined above for satisfied agents. 3.3 Constraints on decision processes In some circumstances market barriers may exist that make switching between products more difficult, particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of changing ones choice of product.",
                "When barriers are present, agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but rather only when the performance evaluation drops below some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures the strength of the market barriers.",
                "Although in this paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗ ), where β∗ is a barrier to defection that is applied when the product is purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional time period the product is used for, and β∗ is the maximum possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary over products i.e. be a function of i. 3.4 Referral processes Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.",
                "The network over which word-of-mouth communication travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of agents into communities and a short average path length between any two agents in the network, and preferential attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.",
                "This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent, with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to its number of existing connections.",
                "This results in a distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.",
                "In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified so that new connections are added with preferential attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal number of connections seems more realistic in the context of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.",
                "When an agent purchases a product, they inform each of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity of agent k∗ to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389 extent to which the agents most recent experience was satisfying or dissatisfying.",
                "Agents are thus more likely to spread word-of-mouth about products that they have just experienced as either very good or very bad.",
                "If an agent receives information on the same product from more than one agent, he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗ , k), the degree to which previous referrals from k∗ to k were successful i.e. resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents referrals and use this information to accept or block future referrals.",
                "In this paper, we employ a learning condition in which Tt(k∗ , k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying referral.",
                "The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a referring agent k∗ does not possess the same subjective preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the converse.",
                "Other referral process are certainly possible, for example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main reason for employing the process described above is simplicity.",
                "Integrating different sources considerably complicates the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others, and raises further questions about the precise nature of the integration.",
                "After determining who contacts whom, the actual referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the perceived level of performance of an experience of product i∗ from the referring agent k∗ to the accepting agent k i.e. pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j, provided that agent k is not currently using i∗ .",
                "Information about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is currently using.",
                "In effect, the referral creates an expected level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for the product referred to, which that agent may then use when making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the decision processes outlined in the previous section.",
                "Once an agent has personally experienced a product, any expected performance levels suggested by previous referrals are replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗ , k) is adjusted depending on whether the experience was a satisfying one or not. 4.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.",
                "Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous subjective opinion functions Sij.",
                "Simulations were run for 500 time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were used in order to generate aggregate results. 4.1 Choice task difficulty We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on the ability of various network configurations to converge to a state in which an acceptable proportion of the population are satisfied.",
                "In the easy choice condition, there are 50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over 4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for all groups.",
                "There are therefore on average approximately 3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "In the hard choice condition, there are 500 products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4 attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to 0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately 4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular agent.",
                "Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more difficult under the hard condition.",
                "The effect of task difficulty is evaluated on three network structures corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world network), and r = 0 (tight communities of agents), with results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3. 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time Proportionsatisfied Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (a) Proportion of agents satisfied 0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 Time Shareofmarket Easy task r = 1 r = 0.05 r = 0 (b) Market share for leading product Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on relationship between network structure (r) and system behaviour Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.",
                "Furthermore, different network structures have very little influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series is given for comparison with the hard condition.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of information relatively independent of the ways in which connections are made.",
                "However, when it is more difficult to locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges to a stable state.",
                "Importantly, the overall satisfaction level to which the system converges remains just below 60% regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a small proportion of connections.",
                "Thus while the random network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional ring lattice.",
                "This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g. κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a network is a more important determinant of system behaviour than the way in which agents are connected to one another.",
                "Similar results are observed when looking at the market share achieved by the market leading product under each level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially independent of network structure for the easy task, with average share converging quickly to around 35%.",
                "Set a more difficult task, the convergence of market share to an approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the smallworld network, with the random and tight community networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their equilibrium levels.",
                "Also interesting is the finding that equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network connections are non-random - the random network seems to suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the market leading product. 4.2 Market barriers In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction.",
                "For simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e. the easy choice task discussed above, but vary the number of connections that each agent begins with in order to simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution on system behaviour.",
                "Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in any one time period, under various levels of market barriers constraining their behaviour.",
                "In these two tables, equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of all time periods).",

                "Firstly, there is a strong diminishing marginal return of additional connections beyond a small number.",
                "The first few connections one makes increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60% from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.",
                "In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative satisfaction levels by less than 4%.",
                "Secondly, word-of-mouth communication continues to play an important role in improving the performance of the system even when market barriers are high.",
                "In fact, the role may even be more important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme barriers (β = 0.4).",
                "Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement (reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by reducing the average amount of time required to find a satisfying brand.",

                "Firstly, in the absence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the market is captured by the market leading products when markets are highly-connected relative to when they are poorlyconnected.",
                "This difference can amount to as much as 15%, and is explained by positive feedback within the more highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one is kept informed about these leading products because at least one of ones contacts is using it.",
                "Secondly, the relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers.",
                "In moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively.",

                "It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in negative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied agent is prevented from switching to another product, are particularly damaging to leading products when agents are well-connected, and that under moderate to strong market barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network.",
                "Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive word-ofmouth communication and increase negative communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for more highly-connected networks.",
                "The reduction in the number of positive referrals as market barriers impose increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which shows the median number of product trials each agent makes per time period based on a referral from another agent.",

                "Understanding the ways in which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the underlying structural properties of the network and the local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network when making purchase decisions and when interacting with other agents.",
                "These local rules are often constrained by the nature of a particular market, or else imposed by strategic suppliers or social customs.",
                "The proper modelling of a mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of complex and interacting components: networks of communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of information transfer, and adaptive behaviour.",
                "In this paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real world.",
                "Using the key notions of a limited communication network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1) the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree distribution of a network is more influential than the way in which agents are connected, but that both are important in more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small number of connections to create a small-world network can have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements between products are constrained by market barriers, and (5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a result of market barriers can reduce the market share collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent on the existence of a suitably well-connected network structure.",
                "It is the final finding that is likely to be most surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field, and suggests that it may not always be in the best interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent customers from leaving.",
                "In poorly-connected networks, the effect of barriers on market shares is slight.",
                "In contrast, in well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can prevent agents from trying a product that they might otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant harm on market share.",
                "Products with small market share (which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to the product offering poor performance) are relatively unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.",
                "Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in marketing systems.",
                "Naturally the usefulness of results is for the most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the two modules comprising network structure and local behaviour.",
                "On the network side, future work might investigate the relationship between degree distributions, the way connections are created and destroyed over time, whether preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger networks of more heterogenous agents.",
                "On the behavioural side, one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds during the course of communication, responses to systematic changes in product performances over time, the integration of various information sources, and different market barrier structures.",
