White University of Waterloo Emory University Microsoft Research ABSTRACT Web search engines present lists of captions, comprising title, snippet, and URL, to help users decide which search results to visit. Understanding the influence of features of these captions on Web search behavior may help validate algorithms and guidelines for their improved generation. In this paper we develop a methodology to use clickthrough logs from a commercial search engine to study user behavior when interacting with search result captions. The findings of our study suggest that relatively simple caption features such as the presence of all terms query terms, the readability of the snippet, and the length of the URL shown in the caption, can significantly influence users Web search behavior. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval-search process General Terms Experimentation, Human Factors 1. INTRODUCTION The major commercial Web search engines all present their results in much the same way. Each search result is described by a brief caption, comprising the URL of the associated Web page, a title, and a brief summary (or snippet) describing the contents of the page. Often the snippet is extracted from the Web page itself, but it may also be taken from external sources, such as the human-generated summaries found in Web directories. Figure 1 shows a typical Web search, with captions for the top three results. While the three captions share the same basic structure, their content differs in several respects. The snippet of the third caption is nearly twice as long as that of the first, while the snippet is missing entirely from the second caption. The title of the third caption contains all of the query terms in order, while the titles of the first and second captions contain only two of the three terms. One of the query terms is repeated in the first caption. All of the query terms appear in the URL of the third caption, while none appear in the URL of the first caption. The snippet of the first caption consists of a complete sentence that concisely describes the associated page, while the snippet of the third caption consists of two incomplete sentences that are largely unrelated to the overall contents of the associated page and to the apparent intent of the query. While these differences may seem minor, they may also have a substantial impact on user behavior. A principal motivation for providing a caption is to assist the user in determining the relevance of the associated page without actually having to click through to the result. In the case of a navigational query - particularly when the destination is well known - the URL alone may be sufficient to identify the desired page. But in the case of an informational query, the title and snippet may be necessary to guide the user in selecting a page for further study, and she may judge the relevance of a page on the basis of the caption alone. When this judgment is correct, it can speed the search process by allowing the user to avoid unwanted material. When it fails, the user may waste her time clicking through to an inappropriate result and scanning a page containing little or nothing of interest. Even worse, the user may be misled into skipping a page that contains desired information. All three of the results in figure 1 are relevant, with some limitations. The first result links to the main Yahoo Kids! homepage, but it is then necessary to follow a link in a menu to find the main page for games. Despite appearances, the second result links to a surprisingly large collection of online games, primarily with environmental themes. The third result might be somewhat disappointing to a user, since it leads to only a single game, hosted at the Centers for Disease Control, that could not reasonably be described as online. Unfortunately, these page characteristics are not entirely reflected in the captions. In this paper, we examine the influence of caption features on users Web search behavior, using clickthroughs extracted from search engines logs as our primary investigative tool. Understanding this influence may help to validate algorithms and guidelines for the improved generation of the Figure 1: Top three results for the query: kids online games. captions themselves. In addition, these features can play a role in the process of inferring relevance judgments from user behavior [1]. By better understanding their influence, better judgments may result. Different caption generation algorithms might select snippets of different lengths from different areas of a page. Snippets may be generated in a query-independent fashion, providing a summary of the page as a whole, or in a querydependent fashion, providing a summary of how the page relates to the query terms. The correct choice of snippet may depend on aspects of both the query and the result page. The title may be taken from the HTML header or extracted from the body of the document [8]. For links that re-direct, it may be possible to display alternative URLs. Moreover, for pages listed in human-edited Web directories such as the Open Directory Project1 , it may be possible to display alternative titles and snippets derived from these listings. When these alternative snippets, titles and URLs are available, the selection of an appropriate combination for display may be guided by their features. A snippet from a Web directory may consist of complete sentences and be less fragmentary than an extracted snippet. A title extracted from the body may provide greater coverage of the query terms. A URL before re-direction may be shorter and provide a clearer idea of the final destination. The work reported in this paper was undertaken in the context of the Windows Live search engine. The image in figure 1 was captured from Windows Live and cropped to eliminate branding, advertising and navigational elements. The experiments reported in later sections are based on Windows Live query logs, result pages and relevance judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance [1,2]. Nonetheless, given the similarity of caption formats across the major Web search engines we believe the results are applicable to these other engines. The query in 1 www.dmoz.org figure 1 produces results with similar relevance on the other major search engines. This and other queries produce captions that exhibit similar variations. In addition, we believe our methodology may be generalized to other search applications when sufficient clickthrough data is available. 2. RELATED WORK While commercial Web search engines have followed similar approaches to caption display since their genesis, relatively little research has been published about methods for generating these captions and evaluating their impact on user behavior. Most related research in the area of document summarization has focused on newspaper articles and similar material, rather than Web pages, and has conducted evaluations by comparing automatically generated summaries with manually generated summaries. Most research on the display of Web results has proposed substantial interface changes, rather than addressing details of the existing interfaces. 2.1 Display of Web results Varadarajan and Hristidis [16] are among the few who have attempted to improve directly upon the snippets generated by commercial search systems, without introducing additional changes to the interface. They generated snippets from spanning trees of document graphs and experimentally compared these snippets against the snippets generated for the same documents by the Google desktop search system and MSN desktop search system. They evaluated their method by asking users to compare snippets from the various sources. Cutrell and Guan [4] conducted an eye-tracking study to investigate the influence of snippet length on Web search performance and found that the optimal snippet length varied according to the task type, with longer snippets leading to improved performance for informational tasks and shorter snippets for navigational tasks. Many researchers have explored alternative methods for displaying Web search results. Dumais et al. [5] compared an interface typical of those used by major Web search engines with one that groups results by category, finding that users perform search tasks faster with the category interface. Paek et al. [12] propose an interface based on a fisheye lens, in which mouse hovers and other events cause captions to zoom and snippets to expand with additional text. White et al. [17] evaluated three alternatives to the standard Web search interface: one that displays expanded summaries on mouse hovers, one that displays a list of top ranking sentences extracted from the results taken as a group, and one that updates this list automatically through implicit feedback. They treat the length of time that a user spends viewing a summary as an implicit indicator of relevance. Their goal was to improve the ability of users to interact with a given result set, helping them to look beyond the first page of results and to reduce the burden of query re-formulation. 2.2 Document summarization Outside the narrow context of Web search considerable related research has been undertaken on the problem of document summarization. The basic idea of extractive summarization - creating a summary by selecting sentences or fragments - goes back to the foundational work of Luhn [11]. Luhns approach uses term frequencies to identify significant words within a document and then selects and extracts sentences that contain significant words in close proximity. A considerable fraction of later work may be viewed as extending and tuning this basic approach, developing improved methods for identifying significant words and selecting sentences. For example, a recent paper by Sun et al. [14] describes a variant of Luhns algorithm that uses clickthrough data to identify significant words. At its simplest, snippet generation for Web captions might also be viewed as following this approach, with query terms taking on the role of significant words. Since 2000, the annual Document Understanding Conference (DUC) series, conducted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, has provided a vehicle for evaluating much of the research in document summarization2 . Each year DUC defines a methodology for one or more experimental tasks, and supplies the necessary test documents, human-created summaries, and automatically extracted baseline summaries. The majority of participating systems use extractive summarization, but a number attempt natural language generation and other approaches. Evaluation at DUC is achieved through comparison with manually generated summaries. Over the years DUC has included both single-document summarization and multidocument summarization tasks. The main DUC 2007 task is posed as taking place in a question answering context. Given a topic and 25 documents, participants were asked to generate a 250-word summary satisfying the information need enbodied in the topic. We view our approach of evaluating summarization through the analysis of Web logs as complementing the approach taken at DUC. A number of other researchers have examined the value of query-dependent summarization in a non-Web context. Tombros and Sanderson [15] compared the performance of 20 subjects searching a collection of newspaper articles when 2 duc.nist.gov guided by query-independent vs. query-dependent snippets. The query-independent snippets were created by extracting the first few sentences of the articles; the query-dependent snippets were created by selecting the highest scoring sentences under a measure biased towards sentences containing query terms. When query-dependent summaries were presented, subjects were better able to identify relevant documents without clicking through to the full text. Goldstein et al. [6] describe another extractive system for generating query-dependent summaries from newspaper articles. In their system, sentences are ranked by combining statistical and linguistic features. They introduce normalized measures of recall and precision to facilitate evaluation. 2.3 Clickthroughs Queries and clickthroughs taken from the logs of commercial Web search engines have been widely used to improve the performance of these systems and to better understand how users interact with them. In early work, Broder [3] examined the logs of the AltaVista search engine and identified three broad categories of Web queries: informational, navigational and transactional. Rose and Levinson [13] conducted a similar study, developing a hierarchy of query goals with three top-level categories: informational, navigational and resource. Under their taxonomy, a transactional query as defined by Broder might fall under either of their three categories, depending on details of the desired transaction. Lee et al. [10] used clickthrough patterns to automatically categorize queries into one of two categories: informational - for which multiple Websites may satisfy all or part of the users need - and navigational - for which users have a particular Website in mind. Under their taxonomy, a transactional or resource query would be subsumed under one of these two categories. Agichtein et al. interpreted caption features, clickthroughs and other user behavior as implicit feedback to learn preferences [2] and improve ranking [1] in Web search. Xue et al. [18] present several methods for associating queries with documents by analyzing clickthrough patterns and links between documents. Queries associated with documents in this way are treated as meta-data. In effect, they are added to the document content for indexing and ranking purposes. Of particular interest to us is the work of Joachims et al. [9] and Granka et al. [7]. They conducted eye-tracking studies and analyzed log data to determine the extent to which clickthrough data may be treated as implicit relevance judgments. They identified a trust bias, which leads users to prefer the higher ranking result when all other factors are equal. In addition, they explored techniques that treat clicks as pairwise preferences. For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results. Our examination of large search logs compliments their detailed analysis of a smaller number of participants. 3. CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs. Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment. The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9]. We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list. Our primary tool for examining the influence of caption features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a clickthrough inversion. A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1. Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias. For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5). For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases). At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample. When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page. Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address. By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered. If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions. Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user. In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action. Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise. For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing. For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs. Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded. For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions. The outcome at the end of each sampling period is a set of records, with each record describing the clickthroughs for a given query/result combination. Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query. We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions. 3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances, clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs. A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list. Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate judgments. Later results would complement earlier ones, linking to novel or supplementary material, and ordered by their interest to the greatest number of users. Figure 2 provides clickthrough curves for three example queries. For each example, we plot the percentage of clickthroughs against position for the top ten results. The first query (craigslist) is stereotypically navigational, showing a spike at the correct answer (www.craigslist.org). The second query is informational in the sense of Lee et al. [10] (periodic table of elements). Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result. For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior. Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries. For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4. Several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of an inversion in a clickthrough curve. The search engine may have failed in its primary goal, ranking more relevant results below less relevant results. Even when the relative ranking is appropriate, a caption may fail to reflect the content of the underlying page with respect to the query, leading the user to make an incorrect judgment. Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions. 3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member. In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work. Over a four-day period, we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries. From these clicks we identified 355 clickthrough inversions, satisfying the criteria of section 3.1, where relevance judgments existed for both pages. The relevance judgments were made by independent assessors viewing the pages themselves, rather than the captions. Relevance was assessed on a 6-point scale. The outcome is presented in figure 3, which shows the explicit judgments for the 355 clickthrough inversions. In all of these cases, there were more clicks on the lower ranked member of the Relationship Number Percent rel(A) < rel(B) 119 33.5% rel(A) = rel(B) 134 37.7% rel(A) > rel(B) 102 28.7% Figure 3: Relevance relationships at clickthrough inversions. Compares relevance between the higher ranking member of a caption pair (rel(A)) to the relevance of the lower ranking member (rel(B)), where caption A received fewer clicks than caption B. pair (B). The figure shows the corresponding relevance judgments. For example, the first row rel(A) < rel(B), indicates that the higher ranking member of pair (A) was rated as less relevant than the lower ranking member of the pair (B). As we see in the figure, relevance alone appears inadequate to explain the majority of clickthrough inversions. For twothirds of the inversions (236), the page associated with caption A is at least as relevant as the page associated with caption B. For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs. 4. INFLUENCE OF CAPTION FEATURES Having demonstrated that clickthrough inversions cannot always be explained by relevance differences, we explore what features of caption pairs, if any, lead users to prefer one caption over another. For example, we may hypothesize that the absence of a snippet in caption A and the presence of a snippet in caption B (e.g. captions 2 and 3 in figure 1) leads users to prefer caption A. Nonetheless, due to competing factors, a large set of clickthrough inversions may also include pairs where the snippet is missing in caption B and not in caption A. However, if we compare a large set of clickthrough inversions to a similar set of pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their ranking, we would expect to see relatively more pairs where the snippet was missing in caption A. 4.1 Evaluation methodology Following this line of reasoning, we extracted two sets of caption pairs from search logs over a three day period. The first is a set of nearly five thousand clickthrough inversions, extracted according to the procedure described in section 3.1. The second is a corresponding set of caption pairs that do not exhibit clickthrough inversions. In other words, for pairs in this set, the result at the higher rank (caption A) received more clickthroughs than the result at the lower rank (caption B). To the greatest extent possible, each pair in the second set was selected to correspond to a pair in the first set, in terms of result position and number of clicks on each result. We refer to the first set, containing clickthrough inversions, as the INV set; we refer to the second set, containing caption pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their rank order, as the CON set. We extract a number of features characterizing snippets (described in detail in the next section) and compare the presence of each feature in the INV and CON sets. We describe the features as a hypothesized preference (e.g., a preference for captions containing a snippet). Thus, in either set, a given feature may be present in one of two forms: favoring the higher ranked caption (caption A) or favoring the lower ranked caption (caption B). For example, the abFeature Tag Description MissingSnippet snippet missing in caption A and present in caption B SnippetShort short snippet in caption A (< 25 characters) with long snippet (> 100 characters) in caption B TermMatchTitle title of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than the title of caption B TermMatchTS title+snippet of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than the title+snippet of caption B TermMatchTSU title+snippet+URL of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than caption B TitleStartQuery title of caption B (but not A) starts with a phrase match to the query QueryPhraseMatch title+snippet+url contains the query as a phrase match MatchAll caption B contains one match to each term; caption A contains more matches with missing terms URLQuery caption B URL is of the form www.query.com where the query matches exactly with spaces removed URLSlashes caption A URL contains more slashes (i.e. a longer path length) than the caption B URL URLLenDIff caption A URL is longer than the caption B URL Official title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains the term official (with stemming) Home title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains the phrase home page Image title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains a term suggesting the presence of an image gallery Readable caption B (but not A) passes a simple readability test Figure 4: Features measured in caption pairs (caption A and caption B), with caption A as the higher ranked result. These features are expressed from the perspective of the prevalent relationship predicted for clickthrough inversions. sence of a snippet in caption A favors caption B, and the absence of a snippet in caption B favors caption A. When the feature favors caption B (consistent with a clickthrough inversion) we refer to the caption pair as a positive pair. When the feature favors caption A, we refer to it as a negative pair. For missing snippets, a positive pair has the caption missing in caption A (but not B) and a negative pair has the caption missing in B (but not A). Thus, for a specific feature, we can construct four subsets: 1) INV+, the set of positive pairs from INV; 2) INV−, the set of negative pairs from INV; 3) CON+; the set of positive pairs from CON; and 4) CON− the set of negative pairs from CON. The sets INV+, INV−, CON+, and CON− will contain different subsets of INV and CON for each feature. When stating a feature corresponding to a hypothesized user preference, we follow the practice of stating the feature with the expectation that the size of INV+ relative to the size of INV− should be greater than the size of CON+ relative to the size of CON−. For example, we state the missing snippet feature as snippet missing in caption A and present in caption B. This evaluation methodology allows us to construct a contingency table for each feature, with INV essentially forming the experimental group and CON the control group. We can then apply Pearsons chi-square test for significance. 4.2 Features Figure 4 lists the features tested. Many of the features on this list correspond to our own assumptions regarding the importance of certain caption characteristics: the presence of query terms, the inclusion of a snippet, and the importance of query term matches in the title. Other features suggested themselves during the examination of the snippets collected as part of the study described in section 3.3 and during a pilot of the evaluation methodology (section 4.1). For this pilot we collected INV and CON sets of similar sizes, and used these sets to evaluate a preliminary list of features and to establish appropriate parameters for the SnippetShort and Readable features. In the pilot, all of the features list in figure 4 were significant at the 95% level. A small number of other features were dropped after the pilot. These features all capture simple aspects of the captions. The first feature concerns the existence of a snippet and the second concerns the relative size of snippets. Apart from this first feature, we ignore pairs where one caption has a missing snippet. These pairs are not included in the sets constructed for the remaining features, since captions with missing snippets do not contain all the elements of a standard caption and we wanted to avoid their influence. The next six features concern the location and number of matching query terms. For the first five, a match for each query term is counted only once, additional matches for the same term are ignored. The MatchAll feature tests the idea that matching all the query terms exactly once is preferable to matching a subset of the terms many times with a least one query term unmatched. The next three features concern the URLs, capturing aspects of their length and complexity, and the last four features concern caption content. The first two of these content features (Official and Home) suggest claims about the importance or significance of the associated page. The third content feature (Image) suggests the presence of an image gallery, a popular genre of Web page. Terms represented by this feature include pictures, pics, and gallery. The last content feature (Readable) applies an ad-hoc readability metric to each snippet. Regular users of Web search engines may notice occasional snippets that consist of little more than lists of words and phrases, rather than a coherent description. We define our own metric, since the Flesch-Kincaid readability score and similar measures are intended for entire documents not text fragments. While the metric has not been experimentally validated, it does reflect our intuitions and observations regarding result snippets. In English, the 100 most frequent words represent about 48% of text, and we would expect readable prose, as opposed to a disjointed list of words, to contain these words in roughly this proportion. The Readable feature computes the percentage of these top-100 words appearing in each caption. If these words represent more than 40% of one caption and less than 10% of the other, the pair is included in the appropriate set.

For the MatchAll feature, where the sum of the set sizes is 15, we applied Fishers exact test. Features supported at the 95% confidence level are bolded. 5. COMMENTARY The results support claims that missing snippets, short snippets, missing query terms and complex URLs negatively impact clickthroughs. While this outcome may not be surprising, we are aware of no other work that can provide support for claims of this type in the context of a commercial Web search engine. This work was originally motivated by our desire to validate some simple guidelines for the generation of captionssummarizing opinions that we formulated while working on related issues. While our results do not direct address all of the many variables that influence users understanding of captions, they are consistent with the major guidelines. Further work is needed to provide additional support for the guidelines and to understand the relationships among variables. The first of these guidelines underscores the importance of displaying query terms in context: Whenever possible all of the query terms should appear in the caption, reflecting their relationship to the associated page. If a query term is missing from a caption, the user may have no idea why the result was returned. The results for the MatchAll feature directly support this guideline. The results for TermMatchTitle and TermMatchTSU confirm that matching more terms is desirable. Other features provide additional indirect support for this guideline, and none of the results are inconsistent with it. A second guideline speaks to the desirability of presenting the user with a readable snippet: When query terms are present in the title, they need not be repeated in the snippet. In particular, when a high-quality query-independent summary is available from an external source, such as a Web directory, it may be more appropriate to display this summary than a lower-quality query-dependent fragment selected on-the-fly. When titles are available from multiple sources -the header, the body, Web directories - a caption generation algorithm might a select a combination of title, snippet and URL that includes as many of the query terms as possible. When a title containing all query terms can be found, the algorithm might select a query-independent snippet. The MatchAll and Readable features directly support this guideline. Once again, other features provide indirect support, and none of the results are inconsistent with it. Finally, the length and complexity of a URL influences user behavior. When query terms appear in the URL they should highlighted or otherwise distinguished. When multiple URLs reference the same page (due to re-directions, etc.) the shortest URL should be preferred, provided that all query terms will still appear in the caption. In other words, URLs should be selected and displayed in a manner that emphasizes their relationship to the query. The three URL features, as well as TermMatchTSU, directly support this guideline. The influence of the Official and Image features led us to wonder what other terms are prevalent in the captions of clickthrough inversions. As an additional experiment, we treated each of the terms appearing in the INV and CON sets as a separate feature (case normalized), ranking them by their χ2 values. The results are presented in figure 6. Since we use the χ2 statistic as a divergence measure, rather than a significance test, no p-values are given. The final column of the table indicates the direction of the influence, whether the presence of the terms positively or negatively influence clickthroughs. The positive influence of official has already been observed (the difference in the χ2 value from that of figure 5 is due to stemming). None of the terms included in the Image Rank Term χ2 influence 1 encyclopedia 114.6891 ↓ 2 wikipedia 94.0033 ↓ 3 official 36.5566 ↑ 4 and 28.3349 ↑ 5 tourism 25.2003 ↑ 6 attractions 24.7283 ↑ 7 free 23.6529 ↓ 8 sexy 21.9773 ↑ 9 medlineplus 19.9726 ↓ 10 information 19.9115 ↑ Figure 6: Words exhibiting the greatest positive (↑) and negative (↓) influence on clickthrough patterns. feature appear in the top ten, but pictures and photos appear at positions 21 and 22. The high rank given to and may be related to readability (the term the appears in position 20). Most surprising to us is the negative influence of the terms: encyclopedia, wikipedia, free, and medlineplus. The first three terms appear in the title of Wikipedia articles3 and the last appears in the title of MedlinePlus articles4 . These individual word-level features provide hints about issues. More detailed analyses and further experiments will be required to understand these features. 6. CONCLUSIONS Clickthrough inversions form an appropriate tool for assessing the influence of caption features. Using clickthrough inversions, we have demonstrated that relatively simple caption features can significantly influence user behavior. To our knowledge, this is first methodology validated for assessing the quality of Web captions through implicit feedback. In the future, we hope to substantially expand this work, considering more features over larger datasets. We also hope to directly address the goal of predicting relevance from clickthoughs and other information present in search engine logs. 7.

    "original_translation": "La influencia de las características de la leyenda en los patrones de clic en la búsqueda de la web Charles L. A. Clarke Eugene Agichtein Susan Dumais y Ryen W. White University of Waterloo Emory University Microsoft Research Motores de búsqueda web abstractas Presentan listas de subtítulos, componería de título, fragmento y URL, para ayudar a los usuarios, para ayudar a los usuarios.Decide qué resultados de búsqueda visitar. Comprender la influencia de las características de estos subtítulos en el comportamiento de búsqueda web puede ayudar a validar algoritmos y directrices para su generación mejorada. En este documento, desarrollamos una metodología para usar registros de clics desde un motor de búsqueda comercial para estudiar el comportamiento del usuario al interactuar con los subtítulos de los resultados de búsqueda. Los resultados de nuestro estudio sugieren que las características de leyenda relativamente simple, como la presencia de todos los términos de consulta de términos, la legibilidad del fragmento y la longitud de la URL que se muestra en el título, puede influir significativamente en el comportamiento de búsqueda web de los usuarios. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Búsqueda de información y proceso de recuperación Proceso de búsqueda de términos generales Experimentación, Factores humanos 1. Introducción Los principales motores de búsqueda web comercial presentan sus resultados de la misma manera. Cada resultado de la búsqueda se describe mediante un breve título, que comprende la URL de la página web asociada, un título y un breve resumen (o fragmento) que describe el contenido de la página. A menudo, el fragmento se extrae de la página web en sí, pero también se puede tomar de fuentes externas, como los resúmenes generados por humanos que se encuentran en los directorios web. La Figura 1 muestra una búsqueda web típica, con subtítulos para los tres resultados principales. Mientras que los tres subtítulos comparten la misma estructura básica, su contenido difiere en varios aspectos. El fragmento de la tercera leyenda es casi el doble que el del primero, mientras que el fragmento falta completamente de la segunda leyenda. El título del tercer título contiene todos los términos de consulta en orden, mientras que los títulos de los subtítulos de primer y segundo contienen solo dos de los tres términos. Uno de los términos de la consulta se repite en el primer subtítulo. Todos los términos de consulta aparecen en la URL de la tercera leyenda, mientras que ninguno aparece en la URL de la primera leyenda. El fragmento de la primera leyenda consiste en una oración completa que describe concisamente la página asociada, mientras que el fragmento de la tercera leyenda consta de dos oraciones incompletas que no están relacionadas en gran medida al contenido general de la página asociada y a la intención aparente de la consulta. Si bien estas diferencias pueden parecer menores, también pueden tener un impacto sustancial en el comportamiento del usuario. Una motivación principal para proporcionar un título es ayudar al usuario a determinar la relevancia de la página asociada sin tener que hacer clic con el resultado. En el caso de una consulta de navegación, particularmente cuando el destino es bien conocido, la URL por sí sola puede ser suficiente para identificar la página deseada. Pero en el caso de una consulta informativa, el título y el fragmento pueden ser necesarios para guiar al usuario a seleccionar una página para un estudio adicional, y ella puede juzgar la relevancia de una página solo sobre la base de la leyenda. Cuando este juicio es correcto, puede acelerar el proceso de búsqueda al permitir al usuario evitar material no deseado. Cuando falla, el usuario puede perder su tiempo haciendo clic en un resultado inapropiado y escanear una página que contiene poco o nada de interés. Peor aún, el usuario puede ser engañado para omitir una página que contenga la información deseada. Los tres resultados en la Figura 1 son relevantes, con algunas limitaciones. ¡El primer resultado se vincula con los principales niños de Yahoo!Página de inicio, pero es necesario seguir un enlace en un menú para encontrar la página principal para los juegos. A pesar de las apariciones, el segundo resultado se vincula a una colección sorprendentemente grande de juegos en línea, principalmente con temas ambientales. El tercer resultado podría ser algo decepcionante para un usuario, ya que conduce a un solo juego, alojado en los Centros para el Control de Enfermedades, que no podría describirse razonablemente como en línea. Desafortunadamente, estas características de la página no se reflejan por completo en los subtítulos. En este documento, examinamos la influencia de las características de subtítulos en el comportamiento de búsqueda web de los usuarios, utilizando clics extraídos de los registros de motores de búsqueda como nuestra herramienta de investigación principal. Comprender esta influencia puede ayudar a validar algoritmos y directrices para la generación mejorada de la Figura 1: Tres resultados principales para la consulta: juegos en línea para niños.subtítulos mismos. Además, estas características pueden desempeñar un papel en el proceso de inferir juicios de relevancia del comportamiento del usuario [1]. Al comprender mejor su influencia, pueden resultar mejores juicios. Los diferentes algoritmos de generación de subtítulos pueden seleccionar fragmentos de diferentes longitudes de diferentes áreas de una página. Los fragmentos se pueden generar de manera independiente de la consulta, proporcionando un resumen de la página en su conjunto, o de manera dependiente de la consulta, proporcionando un resumen de cómo la página se relaciona con los términos de la consulta. La elección correcta del fragmento puede depender de los aspectos de la consulta y la página de resultados. El título se puede tomar del encabezado HTML o extraerse del cuerpo del documento [8]. Para los enlaces que vuelven a dirigir, es posible mostrar URL alternativas. Además, para las páginas enumeradas en directorios web editados por humanos, como el Open Directory Project1, es posible mostrar títulos y fragmentos alternativos derivados de estos listados. Cuando estos fragmentos alternativos, títulos y URL están disponibles, la selección de una combinación apropiada para la pantalla puede guiarse por sus características. Un fragmento de un directorio web puede consistir en oraciones completas y ser menos fragmentario que un fragmento extraído. Un título extraído del cuerpo puede proporcionar una mayor cobertura de los términos de la consulta. Una URL antes de la reirección puede ser más corta y proporcionar una idea más clara del destino final. El trabajo informado en este documento se realizó en el contexto del motor de búsqueda de Windows Live. La imagen en la Figura 1 fue capturada de Windows Live y recortada para eliminar los elementos de marca, publicidad y navegación. Los experimentos informados en secciones posteriores se basan en registros de consultas de Windows Live, páginas de resultados y juicios de relevancia recopilados como parte de la investigación en curso sobre el rendimiento del motor de búsqueda [1,2]. No obstante, dada la similitud de los formatos de subtítulos en los principales motores de búsqueda web, creemos que los resultados son aplicables a estos otros motores. La consulta en 1 www.dmoz.org Figura 1 produce resultados con relevancia similar en los otros motores de búsqueda importantes. Esta y otras consultas producen subtítulos que exhiben variaciones similares. Además, creemos que nuestra metodología puede generalizarse a otras aplicaciones de búsqueda cuando hay suficientes datos de clic disponibles.2. Trabajo relacionado Si bien los motores de búsqueda web comerciales han seguido enfoques similares para la pantalla de subtítulos desde su génesis, se han publicado relativamente poca investigación sobre métodos para generar estos subtítulos y evaluar su impacto en el comportamiento del usuario. La mayoría de las investigaciones relacionadas en el área de resumen de documentos se han centrado en artículos periodísticos y material similar, en lugar de páginas web, y ha realizado evaluaciones comparando resúmenes generados automáticamente con resúmenes generados manualmente. La mayoría de las investigaciones sobre la visualización de resultados web han propuesto cambios sustanciales de interfaz, en lugar de abordar los detalles de las interfaces existentes.2.1 Visualización de resultados web Varadarajan y Hristidis [16] se encuentran entre los pocos que han intentado mejorar directamente sobre los fragmentos generados por los sistemas de búsqueda comerciales, sin introducir cambios adicionales en la interfaz. Generaron fragmentos a partir de los árboles de los gráficos de documentos y compararon experimentalmente estos fragmentos con los fragmentos generados para los mismos documentos por el sistema de búsqueda de escritorio de Google y el sistema de búsqueda de escritorio MSN. Evaluaron su método pidiendo a los usuarios que comparen los fragmentos de las diversas fuentes. Cutrell y Guan [4] realizaron un estudio de seguimiento ocular para investigar la influencia de la longitud del fragmento en el rendimiento de la búsqueda web y descubrieron que la longitud óptima del fragmento varía según el tipo de tarea, con fragmentos más largos que conducen a un rendimiento mejorado para tareas informativas y fragmentos más cortospara tareas de navegación. Muchos investigadores han explorado métodos alternativos para mostrar resultados de búsqueda web. Dumais et al.[5] comparó una interfaz típica de los utilizados por los principales motores de búsqueda web con uno que agrupa los resultados por categoría, encontrando que los usuarios realizan tareas de búsqueda más rápido con la interfaz de categoría. Paek et al.[12] propone una interfaz basada en una lente de peces, en la que el mouse se cierne y otros eventos hacen que los subtítulos de zoom y fragmentos se expandan con texto adicional. White et al.[17] evaluó tres alternativas a la interfaz de búsqueda web estándar: una que muestra resúmenes expandidos en mouse, una que muestra una lista de las oraciones de clasificación más alta extraídas de los resultados tomados como un grupo, y uno que actualiza esta lista automáticamente a través de comentarios implícitos. Tratan el tiempo que un usuario pasa viendo un resumen como un indicador implícito de relevancia. Su objetivo era mejorar la capacidad de los usuarios para interactuar con un conjunto de resultados determinado, ayudándoles a mirar más allá de la primera página de resultados y reducir la carga de la reformulación de la consulta.2.2 Resumen de documentos fuera del contexto limitado de la búsqueda web Se ha realizado una investigación considerable relacionada sobre el problema de la resumen de documentos. La idea básica de resumen extractivo, creando un resumen seleccionando oraciones o fragmentos, se remonta al trabajo fundamental de Luhn [11]. El enfoque de Luhns utiliza frecuencias de términos para identificar palabras significativas dentro de un documento y luego selecciona y extrae oraciones que contienen palabras significativas muy cerca. Se puede ver una fracción considerable del trabajo posterior como extender y ajustar este enfoque básico, desarrollando métodos mejorados para identificar palabras significativas y seleccionar oraciones. Por ejemplo, un artículo reciente de Sun et al.[14] describe una variante del algoritmo de Luhns que utiliza datos de clic para identificar palabras significativas. En su forma más simple, la generación de fragmentos para los subtítulos web también podría verse como siguiendo este enfoque, con términos de consulta asumiendo el papel de palabras significativas. Desde 2000, la serie anual de comprensión de documentos (DUC), realizada por el Instituto Nacional de Normas y Tecnología de los Estados Unidos, ha proporcionado un vehículo para evaluar gran parte de la investigación en la resumen de documentos2. Cada año, DUC define una metodología para una o más tareas experimentales, y proporciona los documentos de prueba necesarios, resúmenes creados por humanos y se extraen automáticamente resúmenes de línea de base. La mayoría de los sistemas participantes utilizan la resumen extractivo, pero un número de generación del lenguaje natural y otros enfoques. La evaluación en DUC se logra a través de la comparación con resúmenes generados manualmente. A lo largo de los años, DUC ha incluido tanto las tareas de resumen de un solo documento como de resumen de múltiplescumentos. La tarea principal DUC 2007 se plantea como que tiene lugar en un contexto de respuesta de preguntas. Dado un tema y 25 documentos, se les pidió a los participantes que generaran un resumen de 250 palabras que satisface la información que necesita enbodiadas en el tema. Vemos nuestro enfoque de evaluar el resumen a través del análisis de registros web que complementan el enfoque adoptado en DUC. Varios otros investigadores han examinado el valor de la resumen dependiente de la consulta en un contexto no WEB. Tombros y Sanderson [15] compararon el rendimiento de 20 sujetos que buscan una colección de artículos periodísticos cuando 2 duc.nist.gov guiado por fragmentos dependientes de consultas versus consultas dependientes de la consulta. Los fragmentos independientes de la consulta se crearon extrayendo las primeras oraciones de los artículos;Los fragmentos dependientes de la consulta se crearon seleccionando las oraciones más altas de puntuación bajo una medida sesgada hacia oraciones que contienen términos de consulta. Cuando se presentaron resúmenes dependientes de la consulta, los sujetos podían identificar en mejores resultados los documentos relevantes sin hacer clic en el texto completo. Goldstein et al.[6] Describa otro sistema extractivo para generar resúmenes dependientes de la consulta a partir de artículos periodísticos. En su sistema, las oraciones se clasifican combinando características estadísticas y lingüísticas. Introducen medidas normalizadas de recuerdo y precisión para facilitar la evaluación.2.3 Las consultas y los clics tomados de los registros de los motores de búsqueda web comerciales se han utilizado ampliamente para mejorar el rendimiento de estos sistemas y para comprender mejor cómo los usuarios interactúan con ellos. En el trabajo temprano, Broder [3] examinó los registros del motor de búsqueda de Altavista e identificó tres amplias categorías de consultas web: informativo, navegativo y transaccional. Rose y Levinson [13] realizaron un estudio similar, desarrollando una jerarquía de objetivos de consulta con tres categorías de nivel superior: informativo, navegación y recursos. Según su taxonomía, una consulta transaccional definida por Broder podría caer en cualquiera de sus tres categorías, dependiendo de los detalles de la transacción deseada. Lee et al.[10] utilizaron patrones de clic para clasificar automáticamente las consultas en una de dos categorías: Información, para las cuales múltiples sitios web pueden satisfacer todo o parte de los usuarios que necesitan, y navegar, para el cual los usuarios tienen un sitio web particular en mente. Según su taxonomía, una consulta transaccional o de recursos se subsumiría bajo una de estas dos categorías. Agichtein et al.Las características de título interpretadas, los clics y otros comportamientos del usuario como comentarios implícitos para aprender preferencias [2] y mejorar la clasificación [1] en la búsqueda web. Xue et al.[18] Presente varios métodos para asociar consultas con documentos analizando patrones y enlaces de clics entre documentos. Las consultas asociadas con documentos de esta manera se tratan como metadatos. En efecto, se agregan al contenido del documento para fines de indexación y clasificación. De particular interés para nosotros es el trabajo de Joachims et al.[9] y Granka et al.[7]. Realizaron estudios de seguimiento ocular y analizaron datos de registro para determinar en qué medida los datos de clics pueden tratarse como juicios de relevancia implícitos. Identificaron un sesgo de confianza, lo que lleva a los usuarios a preferir el resultado de rango más alto cuando todos los demás factores son iguales. Además, exploraron técnicas que tratan los clics como preferencias por pares. Por ejemplo, un clic en la posición n + 1, después de omitir el resultado en la posición n, puede verse como una preferencia por el resultado en la posición n + 1 en relación con el resultado en la posición N. Estos hallazgos forman la base de la inversión de clicsMetodología que utilizamos para interpretar las interacciones del usuario con los resultados de búsqueda. Nuestro examen de grandes registros de búsqueda complementa su análisis detallado de un número menor de participantes.3. Haga clic en las inversiones, mientras que otros investigadores han evaluado la visualización de resultados de búsqueda web a través de estudios de usuarios, presentando a los usuarios un pequeño número de técnicas diferentes y les pidieron que completen tareas experimentales, abordamos el problema extrayendo comentarios implícitos de los registros de motores de búsqueda. Examinar el comportamiento del usuario in situ nos permite considerar muchas más consultas y características de subtítulos, con el volumen de datos disponibles que compensan la falta de un entorno de laboratorio controlado. El problema sigue siendo la interpretación de la información en estos registros como indicadores implícitos de las preferencias del usuario, y en este asunto estamos guiados por el trabajo de Joachims et al.[9]. Consideramos pares de subtítulos, que parecen adyacentes entre sí en la lista de resultados. Nuestra herramienta principal para examinar la influencia de las características de subtítulos es un tipo de patrón observado con respecto a estos pares de subtítulos, que llamamos una inversión de clic. Una inversión de clics ocurre en la posición n cuando el resultado en la posición n recibe menos clics que el resultado en la posición n + 1. Siguiendo a Joachims et al.[9], interpretamos una inversión de clics como indicando una preferencia por el resultado de clasificación más bajo, superando cualquier sesgo de confianza. Para simplificar, en el resto de este documento, nos referimos a la leyenda de clasificación más alta en un par como la Leyenda A y la Título de clasificación más baja como Leyenda B. 3.1 Extracción de clics para los experimentos informados en este documento, probamos un subconjunto de las consultas y las consultas yHaga clic en los registros del motor de búsqueda de Windows Live durante un período de 3-4 días en tres ocasiones separadas: una vez para los resultados reportados en la Sección 3.3, una vez para un piloto de nuestro experimento principal, y una vez para el experimento en sí (Secciones 4 y5). Para simplificar, restringimos nuestra muestra a consultas enviadas a la interfaz en inglés de EE. UU. E ignoramos cualquier consulta que contenga términos complejos o no alfanuméricos (por ejemplo, operadores y frases). Al final de cada período de muestreo, descargamos subtítulos para las consultas asociadas con la muestra de clics. Al identificar los clics en los registros de motores de búsqueda, consideramos solo la primera acción de clic tomada por un usuario después de ingresar una consulta y ver la página de resultados. Los usuarios se identifican mediante la dirección IP, que es un método razonablemente confiable para eliminar múltiples resultados de un solo usuario, a costa de eliminar falsamente los resultados de múltiples usuarios que comparten la misma dirección. Al centrarnos en el clic inicial, esperamos capturar una impresión de los usuarios de la relevancia relativa dentro de un par de subtítulos cuando se encuentra por primera vez. Si el usuario luego hace clic en otros resultados o vuelve a emitir la misma consulta, ignoramos estas acciones. Cualquier preferencia capturada por una inversión de clics es, por lo tanto, una preferencia entre un grupo de usuarios que emiten una consulta en particular, en lugar de una preferencia por parte de un solo usuario. En el resto del documento, utilizamos el término clic para referir solo a esta acción inicial. Dada la naturaleza dinámica de la web y los volúmenes de datos involucrados, los registros de motores de búsqueda están destinados a contener un ruido considerable. Por ejemplo, incluso durante un período de horas o minutos, el orden de los resultados para una consulta dada puede cambiar, con algunos resultados que aparecen de los diez primeros y apareciendo nuevos. Por esta razón, conservamos los clics para una combinación específica de una consulta y un resultado solo si este resultado aparece en una posición consistente para al menos el 50% de los clics. Se desecharon los clics para el mismo resultado cuando apareció en otras posiciones. Por razones similares, si no detectamos al menos diez clics para una consulta particular durante el período de muestreo, no se conservaron clics para esa consulta.10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 CLASCURA POSICIÓN A)Tabla de elementos 10 20 30 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 CLubio Posición C) Juegos en línea para niños Figura 2: Curvas de clic para tres consultas: a) Una consulta de navegación estereotipada, b) una estereotípicaconsulta informativa, y c) una consulta que exhibe inversiones de clics. El resultado al final de cada período de muestreo es un conjunto de registros, con cada registro que describe los clics para una combinación de consulta/resultados dada. Cada registro incluye una consulta, una posición de resultado, un título, un fragmento, una URL, el número de clics para este resultado y el número total de clics para esta consulta. Luego procesamos este conjunto para generar curvas de clic e identificar inversiones.3.2 Curvas de clics Se puede argumentar que, en circunstancias ideales, las inversiones de clics no estarían presentes en los registros de motores de búsqueda. Un hipotético motor de búsqueda perfecto respondería a una consulta colocando el resultado más probable que sea relevante primero en la lista de resultados. Cada título resumiría adecuadamente el contenido de la página vinculada y su relación con la consulta, lo que permite a los usuarios hacer juicios precisos. Los resultados posteriores complementarían los anteriores, vinculando a material novedoso o complementario, y ordenados por su interés para el mayor número de usuarios. La Figura 2 proporciona curvas de clic para tres consultas de ejemplo. Para cada ejemplo, trazamos el porcentaje de clics contra la posición para los diez mejores resultados. La primera consulta (Craigslist) es estereotípicamente navegación, que muestra un pico en la respuesta correcta (www.craigslist.org). La segunda consulta es informativa en el sentido de Lee et al.[10] (Tabla periódica de elementos). Su curva es más plana y menos sesgada hacia un solo resultado. Para ambas consultas, el número de clics es consistente con las posiciones de resultados, con el porcentaje de clics disminuyendo monotónicamente a medida que aumenta la posición, el comportamiento ideal. Lamentablemente, ningún motor de búsqueda es perfecto, y las inversiones de clics se ven para muchas consultas. Por ejemplo, para la tercera consulta (juegos en línea para niños), la curva de clics exhibe una serie de inversiones de clics, con una preferencia aparente por el resultado en la posición 4. Se pueden alistarse varias causas para explicar la presencia de una inversión en una curva de clics. El motor de búsqueda puede haber fallado en su objetivo principal, clasificando resultados más relevantes por debajo de los resultados menos relevantes. Incluso cuando la clasificación relativa es apropiada, una leyenda puede no reflejar el contenido de la página subyacente con respecto a la consulta, lo que lleva al usuario a hacer un juicio incorrecto. Antes de pasar al segundo caso, abordamos el primero y examinamos en qué medida la relevancia por sí sola puede explicar estas inversiones.3.3 Relevancia La explicación más simple de la presencia de una inversión de clics es una diferencia de relevancia entre el miembro de clasificación más alto del par de subtítulos y el miembro de clasificación más baja. Para examinar en qué medida la relevancia juega un papel en las inversiones de clics, realizamos un experimento inicial utilizando un conjunto de 1.811 consultas con juicios asociados creados como parte del trabajo en curso. Durante un período de cuatro días, probamos los registros del motor de búsqueda y extrajimos más de cien mil clics que involucran estas consultas. De estos clics identificamos 355 inversiones de clics, satisfaciendo los criterios de la Sección 3.1, donde existían juicios de relevancia para ambas páginas. Los juicios de relevancia fueron realizados por evaluadores independientes que vieron las páginas mismas, en lugar de los subtítulos. La relevancia se evaluó en una escala de 6 puntos. El resultado se presenta en la Figura 3, que muestra los juicios explícitos para las 355 inversiones de clics. En todos estos casos, hubo más clics en el miembro más bajo del número de relación del número de relación rel (a) <rel (b) 119 33.5% rel (a) = rel (b) 134 37.7% rel (a)> rel(B) 102 28.7% Figura 3: Relaciones de relevancia en las inversiones de clics. Compara la relevancia entre el miembro de clasificación más alto de un par de subtítulos (Rel (a)) con la relevancia del miembro de clasificación más baja (REL (B)), donde el subtítulo A recibió menos clics que el subtítulo B. Par (B). La figura muestra los juicios de relevancia correspondientes. Por ejemplo, la primera fila Rel (a) <Rel (b) indica que el miembro de clasificación más alto del par (a) se calificó como menos relevante que el miembro de clasificación más bajo del par (b). Como vemos en la figura, la relevancia solo parece inadecuada para explicar la mayoría de las inversiones de clics. Para dos tercios de las inversiones (236), la página asociada con la leyenda A es al menos tan relevante como la página asociada con la leyenda B. Para el 28.7% de las inversiones, A tiene mayor relevancia que B, que recibió el mayor número de clics.4. La influencia de las características de subtítulos que ha demostrado que las inversiones de clics no siempre pueden explicarse por las diferencias de relevancia, exploramos qué características de los pares de subtítulos, si las hay, llevan a los usuarios a preferir una leyenda sobre otro. Por ejemplo, podemos plantear la hipótesis de que la ausencia de un fragmento en el subtítulo A y la presencia de un fragmento en el subtítulo B (por ejemplo, subtítulos 2 y 3 en la Figura 1) lleva a los usuarios a preferir el subtítulo A. No obstante, debido a los factores competitivos, un gran conjunto de inversiones de clics también puede incluir pares donde falta el fragmento en el subtítulo B y no en el subtítulo A. Sin embargo, si comparamos un gran conjunto de inversiones de clics con un conjunto similar de pares para los cuales los clics son consistentes con su clasificación, esperaríamos ver relativamente más pares donde faltaba el fragmento en el subtítulo A. 4.1 Metodología de evaluación después de esta líneadel razonamiento, extrajimos dos conjuntos de pares de subtítulos de registros de búsqueda durante un período de tres días. El primero es un conjunto de casi cinco mil inversiones de clics, extraídas de acuerdo con el procedimiento descrito en la Sección 3.1. El segundo es un conjunto correspondiente de pares de subtítulos que no exhiben inversiones de clics. En otras palabras, para los pares en este conjunto, el resultado en el rango más alto (Leyenda A) recibió más clics que el resultado en el rango más bajo (subtítulos B). En la mayor medida posible, cada par en el segundo conjunto se seleccionó para corresponder a un par en el primer conjunto, en términos de posición de resultado y número de clics en cada resultado. Nos referimos al primer conjunto, que contiene inversiones de clics, como el conjunto de inv;Nos referimos al segundo conjunto, que contiene pares de subtítulos para los cuales los clics son consistentes con su orden de rango, como el Conjunto. Extraemos una serie de características que caracterizan los fragmentos (descritos en detalle en la siguiente sección) y comparamos la presencia de cada característica en los conjuntos Inv y Con. Describimos las características como una preferencia hipotética (por ejemplo, una preferencia por los subtítulos que contienen un fragmento). Por lo tanto, en cualquier conjunto, una característica dada puede estar presente en una de dos formas: favorecer el subtítulo de rango más alto (Leyenda A) o favorecer el título de menor rango (Título B). Por ejemplo, la etiqueta abfeature descripción missssnippet fragmento que falta en el subtítulo A y presente en el subtítulo B fragmento de fragmento breve fragmento en el subtítulo A (<25 caracteres) con fragmento largo (> 100 caracteres) en el título B Termmatchtitle Título de la subtítulos A contiene menos consultoría a menos consultoríaTérminos que el título de la Título B Término Termmatchts+Fragmento de subtítulos a Contiene coincidencias con menos términos de consulta que el título+Fragmento de la leyenda B Título de Termmatchtsu+Fragmento+URL de subtítulos A Contiene coincidencias con menos términos de consulta que el título B Title de TitleStartyB (pero no A) comienza con una frase coincidente con la consulta Título de la consulta de consulta+fragmento+URL contiene la consulta como una ley de frase bate batchall B contiene una coincidencia en cada término;La leyenda A contiene más coincidencias con términos faltantes UrlQuery El título B URL es del formulario www.Query.com, donde la consulta coincide exactamente con espacios eliminados con títulos de cetrtación URLS con Capítulo de URLS de Urllendiff.Una URL es más larga que el título Oficial de la URL de la Título B o el fragmento de la leyenda B (pero no A) contiene el término Título de la casa oficial (con Stemming) o fragmento de subtítulos B (pero no A) contiene el título de la imagen de la página de iniciode la leyenda B (pero no A) contiene un término que sugiere la presencia de una galería de imágenes, la leyenda legible B (pero no A) pasa una prueba de legibilidad simple Figura 4: Características medidas en los pares de subtítulos (subtítulos A y Leyte B), con un subtítulo AComo resultado de mayor clasificación. Estas características se expresan desde la perspectiva de la relación prevalente prevalecida para las inversiones de clics.sentido de un fragmento en el subtítulo A favorece el subtítulo B, y la ausencia de un fragmento en el subtítulo B favorece el subtítulo A. Cuando la característica favorece la leyenda B (consistente con una inversión de clics), nos referimos al par de subtítulos como un par positivo. Cuando la característica favorece el título A, nos referimos a él como un par negativo. Para los fragmentos faltantes, un par positivo tiene la leyenda que falta en la leyenda A (pero no B) y un par negativo tiene la leyenda que falta en B (pero no A). Por lo tanto, para una característica específica, podemos construir cuatro subconjuntos: 1) Inv+, el conjunto de pares positivos de Inv;2) Inv-, el conjunto de pares negativos de Inv;3) Con+;el conjunto de pares positivos de Con;y 4) Con - el conjunto de pares negativos de Con. Los conjuntos Inv+, Inv−, Con+y Con- contendrán diferentes subconjuntos de Inv y Con para cada característica. Al declarar una característica correspondiente a una preferencia hipotética del usuario, seguimos la práctica de indicar la característica con la expectativa de que el tamaño de Inv+ en relación con el tamaño de Inv- debería ser mayor que el tamaño de Con+ en relación con el tamaño de Con-. Por ejemplo, indicamos la función de fragmento faltante como fragmento que falta en el subtítulo A y el presente en el subtítulo B. Esta metodología de evaluación nos permite construir una tabla de contingencia para cada característica, con Inv esencialmente formando el grupo experimental y el grupo de control. Luego podemos aplicar la prueba de Chi-cuadrado de Pearsons para obtener importancia.4.2 Características La Figura 4 enumera las características probadas. Muchas de las características de esta lista corresponden a nuestros propios supuestos con respecto a la importancia de ciertas características de la leyenda: la presencia de términos de consulta, la inclusión de un fragmento y la importancia del término de consulta coincide en el título. Otras características se sugirieron durante el examen de los fragmentos recolectados como parte del estudio descrito en la Sección 3.3 y durante un piloto de la metodología de evaluación (Sección 4.1). Para este piloto recopilamos conjuntos de Inv y Confis de tamaños similares, y utilizamos estos conjuntos para evaluar una lista preliminar de características y para establecer parámetros apropiados para el fragmento de fragmento y características legibles. En el piloto, todas las características en la Figura 4 fueron significativas en el nivel del 95%. Se eliminó un pequeño número de otras características después del piloto. Estas características capturan aspectos simples de los subtítulos. La primera característica se refiere a la existencia de un fragmento y el segundo se refiere al tamaño relativo de los fragmentos. Además de esta primera característica, ignoramos los pares donde un subtítulo tiene un fragmento que falta. Estos pares no están incluidos en los conjuntos construidos para las características restantes, ya que los subtítulos con fragmentos faltantes no contienen todos los elementos de una leyenda estándar y queríamos evitar su influencia. Las siguientes seis características se refieren a la ubicación y el número de términos de consulta coincidentes. Para los primeros cinco, una coincidencia para cada término de consulta se cuenta solo una vez, se ignoran coincidencias adicionales para el mismo término. La función Matchall prueba la idea de que coincidir con todos los términos de la consulta exactamente una vez es preferible a coincidir con un subconjunto de los términos muchas veces con al menos un término de consulta inigualable. Las siguientes tres características se refieren a las URL, capturando aspectos de su longitud y complejidad, y las últimas cuatro características se refieren al contenido de subtítulos. Las dos primeras características de contenido (Oficial y Hogar) sugieren reclamos sobre la importancia o la importancia de la página asociada. La tercera función de contenido (imagen) sugiere la presencia de una galería de imágenes, un género popular de la página web. Los términos representados por esta característica incluyen imágenes, fotos y galería. La última función de contenido (legible) aplica una métrica de legibilidad ad-hoc a cada fragmento. Los usuarios regulares de los motores de búsqueda web pueden notar fragmentos ocasionales que consisten en poco más que listas de palabras y frases, en lugar de una descripción coherente. Definimos nuestra propia métrica, ya que el puntaje de legabilidad Flesch-Kinincaid y las medidas similares están destinadas a documentos completos, no fragmentos de texto. Si bien la métrica no se ha validado experimentalmente, sí refleja nuestras intuiciones y observaciones con respecto a los fragmentos de resultados. En inglés, las 100 palabras más frecuentes representan aproximadamente el 48% del texto, y esperaríamos que la prosa legible, en oposición a una lista de palabras desarticuladas, contenga estas palabras en aproximadamente esta proporción. La característica legible calcula el porcentaje de estas 100 palabras principales que aparecen en cada leyenda. Si estas palabras representan más del 40% de una leyenda y menos del 10% de la otra, el par está incluido en el conjunto apropiado.

Para la función Matchall, donde la suma de los tamaños del conjunto es 15, aplicamos la prueba exacta de los pescadores. Las características respaldadas al nivel de confianza del 95% están en negrita.5. Comentario Los resultados respaldan afirman que faltan fragmentos, fragmentos cortos, términos de consulta faltantes y URL complejas impactan negativamente los clics. Si bien este resultado puede no ser sorprendente, no somos conscientes de ningún otro trabajo que pueda proporcionar apoyo para las afirmaciones de este tipo en el contexto de un motor de búsqueda web comercial. Este trabajo fue motivado originalmente por nuestro deseo de validar algunas pautas simples para la generación de subtítulos de manera que las opiniones que formulamos mientras trabajamos en temas relacionados. Si bien nuestros resultados no abordan directamente todas las muchas variables que influyen en la comprensión de los usuarios de los subtítulos, son consistentes con las principales pautas. Se necesita más trabajo para proporcionar apoyo adicional para las pautas y comprender las relaciones entre las variables. La primera de estas pautas subraya la importancia de mostrar los términos de consulta en contexto: siempre que sea posible, todos los términos de consulta deben aparecer en el título, lo que refleja su relación con la página asociada. Si falta un término de consulta en un título, el usuario puede no tener idea de por qué se devolvió el resultado. Los resultados para la función Matchall admiten directamente esta directriz. Los resultados para TermMatchTitle y TermMatchTSU confirman que es deseable coincidir más términos. Otras características proporcionan soporte indirecto adicional para esta guía, y ninguno de los resultados es inconsistente con ella. Una segunda guía habla de la conveniencia de presentar al usuario un fragmento legible: cuando los términos de consulta están presentes en el título, no necesitan repetirse en el fragmento. En particular, cuando hay un resumen independiente de la consulta de alta calidad disponible en una fuente externa, como un directorio web, puede ser más apropiado mostrar este resumen que un fragmento dependiente de la consulta de menor calidad seleccionado en la marcha. Cuando hay títulos disponibles en múltiples fuentes, el encabezado, el cuerpo, los directorios web, un algoritmo de generación de subtítulos podría seleccionar una combinación de título, fragmento y URL que incluya la mayor cantidad posible de términos de consulta. Cuando se puede encontrar un título que contiene todos los términos de consulta, el algoritmo puede seleccionar un fragmento independiente de la consulta. Las características matarias y legibles admiten directamente esta directriz. Una vez más, otras características proporcionan soporte indirecto, y ninguno de los resultados es inconsistente con él. Finalmente, la longitud y la complejidad de una URL influyen en el comportamiento del usuario. Cuando los términos de consulta aparecen en la URL, deben resaltar o distinguirse de otra manera. Cuando múltiples URL se refieren a la misma página (debido a las re-direcciones, etc.), se debe preferir la URL más corta, siempre que todos los términos de consulta aún aparezcan en el título. En otras palabras, las URL deben seleccionarse y mostrarse de manera que enfatice su relación con la consulta. Las tres características de URL, así como TermMatchTSU, admiten directamente esta guía. La influencia de las características oficiales y de imagen nos llevó a preguntarnos qué otros términos prevalecen en los subtítulos de las inversiones de clics. Como un experimento adicional, tratamos cada uno de los términos que aparecen en el Inv y la Con establecido como una característica separada (caso normalizado), clasificándolos por sus valores de χ2. Los resultados se presentan en la Figura 6. Dado que usamos la estadística χ2 como una medida de divergencia, en lugar de una prueba de significancia, no se dan valores p. La columna final de la tabla indica la dirección de la influencia, si la presencia de los términos influye positiva o negativamente en los clics. La influencia positiva del funcionario ya se ha observado (la diferencia en el valor de χ2 de la de la Figura 5 se debe a Stemming). Ninguno de los términos incluidos en el rango de imagen Término χ2 Influencia 1 Enciclopedia 114.6891 ↓ 2 Wikipedia 94.0033 ↓ 3 Oficial 36.5566 ↑ 4 y 28.3349 ↑ 5 Turismo 25.2003 ↑ 6 Atracciones 24.7283 ↑ 7 gratis 23.6529 ↓ 8 sexy 21.9773 ↑ 9 9 MedlinePlus 19.9726 ure.19.9115 ↑ Figura 6: Palabras que exhiben la influencia más positiva (↑) y negativa (↓) en los patrones de clics.La característica aparece en los diez primeros, pero las imágenes y las fotos aparecen en las posiciones 21 y 22. El alto rango dado y puede estar relacionado con la legibilidad (el término aparece en la posición 20). Lo más sorprendente para nosotros es la influencia negativa de los términos: Enciclopedia, Wikipedia, Free y MedlinePlus. Los primeros tres términos aparecen en el título de Wikipedia Artículos3 y el último aparece en el título de MedlinePlus Articles4. Estas características individuales a nivel de palabras proporcionan pistas sobre los problemas. Se requerirán análisis más detallados y más experimentos para comprender estas características.6. Conclusiones Las inversiones de clics forman una herramienta apropiada para evaluar la influencia de las características de subtítulos. Utilizando las inversiones de clicshrough, hemos demostrado que las características de subtítulos relativamente simples pueden influir significativamente en el comportamiento del usuario. Hasta donde sabemos, esta es la primera metodología validada para evaluar la calidad de los subtítulos web a través de la retroalimentación implícita. En el futuro, esperamos expandir sustancialmente este trabajo, considerando más características sobre conjuntos de datos más grandes. También esperamos abordar directamente el objetivo de predecir la relevancia a partir de los clics y otra información presente en los registros de motores de búsqueda.7.

        "The basic idea of extractive summarization - creating a summary by selecting sentences or fragments - goes back to the foundational work of Luhn [11].",
        "Luhns approach uses term frequencies to identify significant words within a document and then selects and extracts sentences that contain significant words in close proximity.",
        "A considerable fraction of later work may be viewed as extending and tuning this basic approach, developing improved methods for identifying significant words and selecting sentences.",
        "For example, a recent paper by Sun et al. [14] describes a variant of Luhns algorithm that uses clickthrough data to identify significant words.",
        "At its simplest, snippet generation for Web captions might also be viewed as following this approach, with query terms taking on the role of significant words.",
        "Since 2000, the annual Document Understanding Conference (DUC) series, conducted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, has provided a vehicle for evaluating much of the research in document summarization2 .",
        "Each year DUC defines a methodology for one or more experimental tasks, and supplies the necessary test documents, human-created summaries, and automatically extracted baseline summaries.",
        "The majority of participating systems use extractive summarization, but a number attempt natural language generation and other approaches.",

        "We view our approach of evaluating summarization through the analysis of Web logs as complementing the approach taken at DUC.",
        "A number of other researchers have examined the value of query-dependent summarization in a non-Web context.",
        "Tombros and Sanderson [15] compared the performance of 20 subjects searching a collection of newspaper articles when 2 duc.nist.gov guided by query-independent vs. query-dependent snippets.",
        "The query-independent snippets were created by extracting the first few sentences of the articles; the query-dependent snippets were created by selecting the highest scoring sentences under a measure biased towards sentences containing query terms.",
        "When query-dependent summaries were presented, subjects were better able to identify relevant documents without clicking through to the full text.",
        "Goldstein et al. [6] describe another extractive system for generating query-dependent summaries from newspaper articles.",

        "Rose and Levinson [13] conducted a similar study, developing a hierarchy of query goals with three top-level categories: informational, navigational and resource.",
        "Under their taxonomy, a transactional query as defined by Broder might fall under either of their three categories, depending on details of the desired transaction.",
        "Lee et al. [10] used clickthrough patterns to automatically categorize queries into one of two categories: informational - for which multiple Websites may satisfy all or part of the users need - and navigational - for which users have a particular Website in mind.",
        "Under their taxonomy, a transactional or resource query would be subsumed under one of these two categories.",

        "Of particular interest to us is the work of Joachims et al. [9] and Granka et al. [7].",
        "They conducted eye-tracking studies and analyzed log data to determine the extent to which clickthrough data may be treated as implicit relevance judgments.",
        "They identified a trust bias, which leads users to prefer the higher ranking result when all other factors are equal.",
        "In addition, they explored techniques that treat clicks as pairwise preferences.",
        "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",

        "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
        "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
        "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",
        "We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list.",
        "Our primary tool for examining the influence of caption features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a clickthrough inversion.",
        "A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1.",
        "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
        "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
        "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
        "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
        "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
        "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
        "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
        "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
        "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",
        "Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise.",
        "For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.",
        "For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.",
        "Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.",
        "For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions.",

        "Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query.",
        "We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions. 3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances, clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs.",
        "A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list.",
        "Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate judgments.",
        "Later results would complement earlier ones, linking to novel or supplementary material, and ordered by their interest to the greatest number of users.",

        "Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result.",
        "For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior.",
        "Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries.",
        "For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4.",
        "Several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of an inversion in a clickthrough curve.",
        "The search engine may have failed in its primary goal, ranking more relevant results below less relevant results.",
        "Even when the relative ranking is appropriate, a caption may fail to reflect the content of the underlying page with respect to the query, leading the user to make an incorrect judgment.",
        "Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions. 3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member.",
        "In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work.",
        "Over a four-day period, we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries.",
        "From these clicks we identified 355 clickthrough inversions, satisfying the criteria of section 3.1, where relevance judgments existed for both pages.",
        "The relevance judgments were made by independent assessors viewing the pages themselves, rather than the captions.",
        "Relevance was assessed on a 6-point scale.",
        "The outcome is presented in figure 3, which shows the explicit judgments for the 355 clickthrough inversions.",
        "In all of these cases, there were more clicks on the lower ranked member of the Relationship Number Percent rel(A) < rel(B) 119 33.5% rel(A) = rel(B) 134 37.7% rel(A) > rel(B) 102 28.7% Figure 3: Relevance relationships at clickthrough inversions.",

        "The figure shows the corresponding relevance judgments.",
        "For example, the first row rel(A) < rel(B), indicates that the higher ranking member of pair (A) was rated as less relevant than the lower ranking member of the pair (B).",
        "As we see in the figure, relevance alone appears inadequate to explain the majority of clickthrough inversions.",
        "For twothirds of the inversions (236), the page associated with caption A is at least as relevant as the page associated with caption B.",
        "For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs. 4.",
        "INFLUENCE OF CAPTION FEATURES Having demonstrated that clickthrough inversions cannot always be explained by relevance differences, we explore what features of caption pairs, if any, lead users to prefer one caption over another.",
        "For example, we may hypothesize that the absence of a snippet in caption A and the presence of a snippet in caption B (e.g. captions 2 and 3 in figure 1) leads users to prefer caption A.",
        "Nonetheless, due to competing factors, a large set of clickthrough inversions may also include pairs where the snippet is missing in caption B and not in caption A.",
        "However, if we compare a large set of clickthrough inversions to a similar set of pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their ranking, we would expect to see relatively more pairs where the snippet was missing in caption A. 4.1 Evaluation methodology Following this line of reasoning, we extracted two sets of caption pairs from search logs over a three day period.",
        "The first is a set of nearly five thousand clickthrough inversions, extracted according to the procedure described in section 3.1.",
        "The second is a corresponding set of caption pairs that do not exhibit clickthrough inversions.",
        "In other words, for pairs in this set, the result at the higher rank (caption A) received more clickthroughs than the result at the lower rank (caption B).",
        "To the greatest extent possible, each pair in the second set was selected to correspond to a pair in the first set, in terms of result position and number of clicks on each result.",
        "We refer to the first set, containing clickthrough inversions, as the INV set; we refer to the second set, containing caption pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their rank order, as the CON set.",
        "We extract a number of features characterizing snippets (described in detail in the next section) and compare the presence of each feature in the INV and CON sets.",
        "We describe the features as a hypothesized preference (e.g., a preference for captions containing a snippet).",
        "Thus, in either set, a given feature may be present in one of two forms: favoring the higher ranked caption (caption A) or favoring the lower ranked caption (caption B).",
        "For example, the abFeature Tag Description MissingSnippet snippet missing in caption A and present in caption B SnippetShort short snippet in caption A (< 25 characters) with long snippet (> 100 characters) in caption B TermMatchTitle title of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than the title of caption B TermMatchTS title+snippet of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than the title+snippet of caption B TermMatchTSU title+snippet+URL of caption A contains matches to fewer query terms than caption B TitleStartQuery title of caption B (but not A) starts with a phrase match to the query QueryPhraseMatch title+snippet+url contains the query as a phrase match MatchAll caption B contains one match to each term; caption A contains more matches with missing terms URLQuery caption B URL is of the form www.query.com where the query matches exactly with spaces removed URLSlashes caption A URL contains more slashes (i.e. a longer path length) than the caption B URL URLLenDIff caption A URL is longer than the caption B URL Official title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains the term official (with stemming) Home title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains the phrase home page Image title or snippet of caption B (but not A) contains a term suggesting the presence of an image gallery Readable caption B (but not A) passes a simple readability test Figure 4: Features measured in caption pairs (caption A and caption B), with caption A as the higher ranked result.",
        "These features are expressed from the perspective of the prevalent relationship predicted for clickthrough inversions. sence of a snippet in caption A favors caption B, and the absence of a snippet in caption B favors caption A.",
        "When the feature favors caption B (consistent with a clickthrough inversion) we refer to the caption pair as a positive pair.",
        "When the feature favors caption A, we refer to it as a negative pair.",
        "For missing snippets, a positive pair has the caption missing in caption A (but not B) and a negative pair has the caption missing in B (but not A).",
        "Thus, for a specific feature, we can construct four subsets: 1) INV+, the set of positive pairs from INV; 2) INV−, the set of negative pairs from INV; 3) CON+; the set of positive pairs from CON; and 4) CON− the set of negative pairs from CON.",
        "The sets INV+, INV−, CON+, and CON− will contain different subsets of INV and CON for each feature.",
        "When stating a feature corresponding to a hypothesized user preference, we follow the practice of stating the feature with the expectation that the size of INV+ relative to the size of INV− should be greater than the size of CON+ relative to the size of CON−.",

        "We can then apply Pearsons chi-square test for significance. 4.2 Features Figure 4 lists the features tested.",
        "Many of the features on this list correspond to our own assumptions regarding the importance of certain caption characteristics: the presence of query terms, the inclusion of a snippet, and the importance of query term matches in the title.",
        "Other features suggested themselves during the examination of the snippets collected as part of the study described in section 3.3 and during a pilot of the evaluation methodology (section 4.1).",

        "The first feature concerns the existence of a snippet and the second concerns the relative size of snippets.",
        "Apart from this first feature, we ignore pairs where one caption has a missing snippet.",
        "These pairs are not included in the sets constructed for the remaining features, since captions with missing snippets do not contain all the elements of a standard caption and we wanted to avoid their influence.",

        "For the first five, a match for each query term is counted only once, additional matches for the same term are ignored.",
        "The MatchAll feature tests the idea that matching all the query terms exactly once is preferable to matching a subset of the terms many times with a least one query term unmatched.",
        "The next three features concern the URLs, capturing aspects of their length and complexity, and the last four features concern caption content.",
        "The first two of these content features (Official and Home) suggest claims about the importance or significance of the associated page.",

                "They conducted eye-tracking studies and analyzed log data to determine the extent to which clickthrough data may be treated as implicit relevance judgments.",
                "They identified a trust bias, which leads users to prefer the higher ranking result when all other factors are equal.",
                "In addition, they explored techniques that treat clicks as pairwise preferences.",
                "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",
                "Our examination of large search logs compliments their detailed analysis of a smaller number of participants. 3.",
                "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
                "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
                "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",
                "We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list.",
                "Our primary tool for examining the influence of caption features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a clickthrough inversion.",
                "A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1.",
                "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
                "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
                "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
                "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
                "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
                "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
                "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
                "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",
                "Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise.",
                "For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.",
                "For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.",
                "Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.",
                "For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions.",
                "The outcome at the end of each sampling period is a set of records, with each record describing the clickthroughs for a given query/result combination.",
                "Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query.",
                "We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions. 3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances, clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs.",
                "A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list.",
                "Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate judgments.",
                "Later results would complement earlier ones, linking to novel or supplementary material, and ordered by their interest to the greatest number of users.",
                "Figure 2 provides clickthrough curves for three example queries.",
                "For each example, we plot the percentage of clickthroughs against position for the top ten results.",
                "The first query (craigslist) is stereotypically navigational, showing a spike at the correct answer (www.craigslist.org).",
                "The second query is informational in the sense of Lee et al. [10] (periodic table of elements).",
                "Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result.",
                "For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior.",
                "Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries.",
                "For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4.",
                "Several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of an inversion in a clickthrough curve.",
                "The search engine may have failed in its primary goal, ranking more relevant results below less relevant results.",
                "Even when the relative ranking is appropriate, a caption may fail to reflect the content of the underlying page with respect to the query, leading the user to make an incorrect judgment.",
                "Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions. 3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member.",
                "In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work.",
                "Over a four-day period, we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries.",
                "From these clicks we identified 355 clickthrough inversions, satisfying the criteria of section 3.1, where relevance judgments existed for both pages.",
                "The relevance judgments were made by independent assessors viewing the pages themselves, rather than the captions.",

                "They identified a trust bias, which leads users to prefer the higher ranking result when all other factors are equal.",
                "In addition, they explored techniques that treat clicks as pairwise preferences.",
                "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",

                "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
                "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
                "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",

                "Our primary tool for examining the influence of <br>caption feature</br>s is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a clickthrough inversion.",

                "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
                "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
                "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
                "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
                "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
                "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
                "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
                "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",
                "Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise.",
                "For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.",
                "For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.",
                "Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.",
                "For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions.",
                "The outcome at the end of each sampling period is a set of records, with each record describing the clickthroughs for a given query/result combination.",
                "Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query.",
                "We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions. 3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances, clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs.",
                "A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list.",
                "Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate judgments.",

                "Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result.",
                "For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior.",
                "Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries.",
                "For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4.",

                "Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions. 3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member.",
                "In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work.",

                "For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs. 4.",
                "INFLUENCE OF CAPTION FEATURES Having demonstrated that clickthrough inversions cannot always be explained by relevance differences, we explore what features of caption pairs, if any, lead users to prefer one caption over another.",

                "In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work.",

                "To the greatest extent possible, each pair in the second set was selected to correspond to a pair in the first set, in terms of result position and number of clicks on each result.",
                "We refer to the first set, containing clickthrough inversions, as the INV set; we refer to the second set, containing caption pairs for which the clickthroughs are consistent with their rank order, as the CON set.",
                "We extract a number of features characterizing snippets (described in detail in the next section) and compare the presence of each feature in the INV and CON sets.",

                "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the <br>clickthrough inversion</br> methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",

                "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
                "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
                "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",
                "We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list.",
                "Our primary tool for examining the influence of caption features is a type of pattern observed with respect to these caption pairs, which we call a <br>clickthrough inversion</br>.",
                "A <br>clickthrough inversion</br> occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1.",
                "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a <br>clickthrough inversion</br> as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
                "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
                "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
                "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
                "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
                "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
                "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a <br>clickthrough inversion</br> is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",

                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
                "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",

                "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",

                "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of <br>web search</br> results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
                "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
                "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",
                "We consider caption pairs, which appear adjacent to one another in the result list.",

                "A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1.",
                "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
                "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
                "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
                "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
                "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
                "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
                "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
                "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",
                "Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise.",
                "For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.",
                "For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.",
                "Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.",
                "For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions.",

                "Each record includes a query, a result position, a title, a snippet, a URL, the number of clickthroughs for this result, and the total number of clickthroughs for this query.",
                "We then processed this set to generate clickthrough curves and identify inversions. 3.2 Clickthrough curves It could be argued that under ideal circumstances, clickthrough inversions would not be present in search engine logs.",
                "A hypothetical perfect search engine would respond to a query by placing the result most likely to be relevant first in the result list.",
                "Each caption would appropriately summarize the content of the linked page and its relationship to the query, allowing users to make accurate judgments.",
                "Later results would complement earlier ones, linking to novel or supplementary material, and ordered by their interest to the greatest number of users.",

                "The second query is informational in the sense of Lee et al. [10] (periodic table of elements).",
                "Its curve is flatter and less skewed toward a single result.",
                "For both queries, the number of clickthroughs is consistent with the result positions, with the percentage of clickthroughs decreasing monotonically as position increases, the ideal behavior.",
                "Regrettably, no search engine is perfect, and clickthrough inversions are seen for many queries.",
                "For example, for the third query (kids online games) the clickthrough curve exhibits a number of clickthrough inversions, with an apparent preference for the result at position 4.",
                "Several causes may be enlisted to explain the presence of an inversion in a clickthrough curve.",
                "The search engine may have failed in its primary goal, ranking more relevant results below less relevant results.",
                "Even when the relative ranking is appropriate, a caption may fail to reflect the content of the underlying page with respect to the query, leading the user to make an incorrect judgment.",
                "Before turning to the second case, we address the first, and examine the extent to which relevance alone may explain these inversions. 3.3 Relevance The simplest explanation for the presence of a clickthrough inversion is a relevance difference between the higher ranking member of caption pair and the lower ranking member.",
                "In order to examine the extent to which relevance plays a role in clickthrough inversions, we conducted an initial experiment using a set of 1,811 queries with associated judgments created as part of on-going work.",
                "Over a four-day period, we sampled the search engine logs and extracted over one hundred thousand clicks involving these queries.",
                "From these clicks we identified 355 clickthrough inversions, satisfying the criteria of section 3.1, where relevance judgments existed for both pages.",
                "The relevance judgments were made by independent assessors viewing the pages themselves, rather than the captions.",
                "Relevance was assessed on a 6-point scale.",

                "For example, a click at position N + 1 - after skipping the result at position N - may be viewed as a preference for the result at position N+1 relative to the result at position N. These findings form the basis of the clickthrough inversion methodology we use to interpret user interactions with search results.",

                "CLICKTHROUGH INVERSIONS While other researchers have evaluated the display of Web search results through user studies - presenting users with a small number of different techniques and asking them to complete experimental tasks - we approach the problem by extracting implicit feedback from search engine logs.",
                "Examining user behavior in situ allows us to consider many more queries and caption characteristics, with the volume of available data compensating for the lack of a controlled lab environment.",
                "The problem remains of interpreting the information in these logs as implicit indicators of user preferences, and in this matter we are guided by the work of Joachims et al. [9].",

                "Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.",
                "For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper we refer to the higher ranking caption in a pair as caption A and the lower ranking caption as caption B. 3.1 Extracting clickthroughs For the experiments reported in this paper, we sampled a subset of the queries and clickthroughs from the logs of the Windows Live search engine over a period of 3-4 days on three separate occasions: once for results reported in section 3.3, once for a pilot of our main experiment, and once for the experiment itself (sections 4 and 5).",
                "For simplicity we restricted our sample to queries submitted to the US English interface and ignored any queries containing complex or non-alphanumeric terms (e.g. operators and phrases).",
                "At the end of each sampling period, we downloaded captions for the queries associated with the clickthrough sample.",
                "When identifying clickthroughs in search engine logs, we consider only the first clickthrough action taken by a user after entering a query and viewing the result page.",
                "Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.",
                "By focusing on the initial clickthrough, we hope to capture a users impression of the relative relevance within a caption pair when first encountered.",
                "If the user later clicks on other results or re-issues the same query, we ignore these actions.",
                "Any preference captured by a clickthrough inversion is therefore a preference among a group of users issuing a particular query, rather than a preference on the part of a single user.",
                "In the remainder of the paper, we use the term clickthrough to refer only to this initial action.",
                "Given the dynamic nature of the Web and the volumes of data involved, search engine logs are bound to contain considerable noise.",
                "For example, even over a period of hours or minutes the order of results for a given query can change, with some results dropping out of the top ten and new ones appearing.",
                "For this reason, we retained clickthroughs for a specific combination of a query and a result only if this result appears in a consistent position for at least 50% of the clickthroughs.",
                "Clickthroughs for the same result when it appeared at other positions were discarded.",
                "For similar reasons, if we did not detect at least ten clickthroughs for a particular query during the sampling period, no clickthroughs for that query were retained. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position a) craigslist 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position b) periodic table of elements 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 clickthroughpercent position c) kids online games Figure 2: Clickthrough curves for three queries: a) a stereotypical navigational query, b) a stereotypical informational query, and c) a query exhibiting clickthrough inversions.",
