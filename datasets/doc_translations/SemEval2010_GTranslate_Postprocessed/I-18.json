INTRODUCTION Much research has been undertaken to increase satellite autonomy such as enabling them to solve by themselves problems that may occur during a mission, adapting their behaviour to new events and transferring planning on-board ; even if the development cost of such a satellite is increased, there is an increase in performance and mission possibilities [34]. Moreover, the use of satellite swarms - sets of satellites flying in formation or in constellation around the Earthmakes it possible to consider joint activities, to distribute skills and to ensure robustness. Multi-agent architectures have been developed for satellite swarms [36, 38, 42] but strong assumptions on deliberation and communication capabilities are made in order to build a collective plan. Mono-agent planning [4, 18, 28] and task allocation [20] are widely studied. In a multi-agent context, agents that build a collective plan must be able to change their goals, reallocate resources and react to environment changes and to the others choices. A coordination step must be added to the planning step [40, 30, 11]. However, this step needs high communication and computation capabilities. For instance, coalition-based [37], contract-based [35] and all negotiationbased [25] mechanisms need these capabilities, especially in dynamic environments. In order to relax communication constraints, coordination based on norms and conventions [16] or strategies [17] are considered. Norms constraint agents in their decisions in such a way that the possibilities of conflicts are reduced. Strategies are private decision rules that allow an agent to draw benefit from the knowledgeable world without communication. However, communication is still needed in order to share information and build collective conjectures and plans. Communication can be achieved through a stigmergic approach (via the environment) or through message exchange and a protocol. A protocol defines interactions between agents and cannot be uncoupled from its goal, e.g. exchanging information, finding a trade-off, allocating tasks and so on. Protocols can be viewed as an abstraction of an interaction [9]. They may be represented in a variety of ways, e.g. AUML [32] or Petri-nets [23]. As protocols are originally designed for a single goal, some works aim at endowing them with flexibility [8, 26]. However, an agent cannot always communicate with another agent or the communication possibilites are restricted to short time intervals. The objective of this work is to use intersatellite connections, called InterSatellite Links or ISL, in an Earth observation constellation inspired from the Fuego mission [13, 19], in order to increase the system reactivity and to improve the mission global return through a hybrid agent approach. At the individual level, agents are deliberative in order to create a local plan but at the collective level, they use normative decision rules in order to coordinate with one another. We will present the features of our problem, a communication protocol, a method for request allocation and finally, collaboration strategies. 287 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS 2. PROBLEM FEATURES An observation satellite constellation is a set of satellites in various orbits whose mission is to take pictures of various areas on the Earth surface, for example hot points corresponding to volcanos or forest fires. The ground sends the constellation observation requests characterized by their geographical positions, priorities specifying if the requests are urgent or not, the desired dates of observation and the desired dates for data downloading. The satellites are equipped with a single observation instrument whose mirror can roll to shift the line of sight. A minimum duration is necessary to move the mirror, so requests that are too close together cannot be realized by the same satellite. The satellites are also equipped with a detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board. The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles. A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar areas, and thus can communicate without the ground intervention. Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time. The features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 3. A MULTI-AGENT APPROACH As each satellite is a single entity that is a piece of the global swarm, a multi-agent system fits to model satellite constellations [39]. This approach has been developped through the ObjectAgent architecture [38], TeamAgent [31], DIPS [14] or Prospecting ANTS [12]. 3.1 Satellite swarm An observation satellite swarm1 is a multi-agent system where the requests do not have to be carried out in a fixed order and the agents (the satellites) do not have any physical interaction. Carrying out a request cannot prevent another agent from carrying out another one, even the same one. At most, there will be a waste of resources. Formally, a swarm is defined as follows: Definition 1 (Swarm). A satellite swarm E is a triplet < S, T, Vicinity >: - S is a set of n agents {s1 . . . sn}; - T ⊆ R+ or N+ is a set of dates with a total order <; - Vicinity : S × T → 2S . In the sequel, we will assume that the agents share a common clock. For a given agent and a given time, the vicinity relation returns the set of agents with whom it can communicate at that time. As we have seen previously, this relation exists when the agents meet. 1 This term will designate a satellite constellation with InterSatellite Links. 3.2 Requests Requests are the observation tasks that the satellite swarm must achieve. As we have seen previously, the requests are generated both on the ground and on board. Each agent is allocated a set of initial requests. During the mission, new requests are sent to the agents by the ground or agents can generate new requests by themselves. Formally, a request is defined as follows: Definition 2 (Request). A request R is defined as a tuple < idR, pos(R), prio(R), tbeg(R),bR >: - idR is an identifier; - pos(R) is the geographic position of R; - prio(R) ∈ R is the request priority; - tbeg(R) ∈ T is the desired date of observation; - bR ∈ {true, false} specifies if R has been realized. The priority prio(R) of a request represents how much it is important for the user, namely the request sender, that the request should be carried out. Thus a request with a high priority must be realized at all costs. In our application, priorities are comprised between 1 and 5 (the highest). In the sequel, we will note Rt si the set of the requests that are known by agent si at time t ∈ T. For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R. More formally: Definition 3 (Candidacy). A candidacy C is a tuple < idC , modC, sC , RC , obsC, dnlC >: - idC is an identifier; - modC ∈ {3, 2, ¬3, ¬2} is a modality; - sC ∈ S is the candidate agent; - RC ∈ Rt sC is the request on which sC candidates; - obsC ∈ T is the realization date proposed by sC ; - dnlC ∈ T is the download date. 3.4 Problem formalization Then, our problem is the following: we would like each agent to build request allocations (i.e a plan) dynamically such as if these requests are carried out their number is the highest possible or the global cost is minimal. More formally, Definition 4 (Problem). Let E be a swarm. Agents si in E must build a set {At s1 . . . At sn } where At si ⊆ Rt si such 288 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) as: - | S si∈S At si | is maximal; P si∈S P R∈At si prio(R) is maximal. P si∈S P R∈At si costsi (R) is minimal. Let us notice that these criteria are not necessarily compatible. As the choices of an agent will be influenced by the choices of the others, it is necessary that the agents should reason on a common knowledge about the requests. It is thus necessary to set up an effective communication protocol. 4. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL Communication is commonly associated with cooperation. Deliberative agents need communication to cooperate, whereas it is not necessarily the case for reactive agents [2, 41]. Gossip protocols [22, 24], or epidemic protocols, are used to share knowledge with multicast. Each agent selects a set of agents at a given time in order to share information. The speed of information transmission is contingent upon the length of the discussion round. 4.1 The corridor metaphor The suggested protocol is inspired from what we name the corridor metaphor, which represents well the satellite swarm problem. Various agents go to and fro in a corridor where objects to collect appear from time to time. Two objects that are too close to each other cannot be collected by the same agent because the action takes some time and an agent cannot stop its movement. In order to optimize the collection, the agents can communicate when they meet. S 2 S ABel A 1 A 3S Figure 1: Time t 1 S 2S Bel non A 3S Figure 2: Time t Example 1. Let us suppose three agents, s1, s2, s3 and an object A to be collected. At time t, s1 did not collect A and s2 does not know that A exists. When s1 meets s2, it communicates the list of the objects it knows, that is to say A. s2 now believes that A exists and prepares to collect it. It is not certain that A is still there because another agent may have passed before s2, but it can take it into account in its plan. At time t , s3 collects A. In the vicinity of s2, s3 communicates its list of objects and A is not in the list. As both agents meet in a place where it is possible for s3 to have collected A, the object would have been in the list if it had not been collected. s2 can thus believe that A does not exist anymore and can withdraw it from its plan. 4.2 Knowledge to communicate In order to build up their plans, agents need to know the current requests and the others agents intentions. For each agent two kinds of knowledge to maintain are defined: - requests (Definition 2); - candidacies (Definition 3). Definition 5 (Knowledge). Knowledge K is a tuple < data(K), SK , tK >: - data(K) is a request R or a candidacy C; - SK ⊆ S is the set of agents knowing K; - tK ∈ T is a temporal timestamp. In the sequel, we will note Kt si the knowledge of agent si at time t ∈ T. 4.3 An epidemic protocol From the corridor metaphor, we can define a communication protocol that benefits from all the communication opportunities. An agent notifies any change within its knowledge and each agent must propagate these changes to its vicinity who update their knowledge bases and reiterate the process. This protocol is a variant of epidemic protocols [22] inspired from the work on overhearing [27]. Protocol 1 (Communication). Let si be an agent in S. ∀t ∈ T: - ∀ sj ∈ Vicinity(si, t), si executes: 1. ∀ K ∈ Kt si such as sj ∈ SK : a. si communicates K to sj b. if sj acknowledges receipt of K, SK ← SK ∪ {sj}. - ∀ K ∈ Kt si received by sj at time t: 1. sj updates Kt sj with K 2. sj acknowledges receipt of K to si. Two kinds of updates exist for an agent: - an internal update from a knowledge modification by the agent itself; - an external update from received knowledge. For an internal update, updating K depends on data(K): a candidacy C is modified when its modality changes and a request R is modified when an agent realizes it. When K is updated, the timestamp is updated too. Protocol 2 (Internal update). Let si ∈ S be an agent. An internal update from si at time t ∈ T is performed: - when knowledge K is created; - when data(K) is modified. In both cases: 1. tK ← t; 2. SK ← {si}. For an external update, only the most recent knowledge K is taken into account because timestamps change only when data(K) is modified. If K is already known, it is updated if the content or the set of agents knowing it have been modified. If K is unknown, it is simply added to the agents knowledge. Protocol 3 (External update). Let si be an agent and K the knowledge transmitted by agent sj. ∀ K ∈ K, the external update at time t ∈ T is defined as follows: 1. if ∃ K ∈ Kt si such as iddata(K) = iddata(K ) then a. if tK ≥ tK then i. if tK > tK then SK ← SK ∪ {si} ii. if tK = tK then SK ← SK ∪ SK iii. Kt si ← (Kt si \\{K }) ∪ {K} 2. else a. Kt si ← Kt si ∪ {K} b. SK ← SK ∪ {si} The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 289 If the incoming information has a more recent timestamp, it means that the receiver agent has obsolete information. Consequently, it replaces the old information by the new one and adds itself to the set of agents knowing K (1.a.i). If both timestamps are the same, both pieces of information are the same. Only the set of the agents knowing K may have changed because agents si and sj may have already transmitted the information to other agents. Consequently, the sets of agents knowing K are unified (1.a.ii). 4.4 Properties Communication between two agents when they meet is made of the conjunction of Protocol 1 and Protocol 3. In the sequel, we call this conjunction a communication occurrence. 4.4.1 Convergence The structure of the transmitted information and the internal update mechanism (Protocol 2) allow the process to converge. Indeed, a request R can only be in two states (realized or not) given by the boolean bR. Once an internal update is made - i.e. R is realized - R cannot go back to its former state. Consequently, an internal update can only be performed once. As far as candidacies are concerned, updates only modify the modalities, which may change many times and go back to previous states. Then it seems that livelocks2 would be likely to appear. However, a candidacy C is associated to a request and a realization date (the deadline given by obsC ). After the deadline, the candidacy becomes meaningless. Thus for each candidacy, there exists a date t ∈ T when changes will propagate no more. 4.4.2 Complexity It has been shown that in a set of N agents where a single one has a new piece of information, an epidemic protocol takes O(logN) steps to broadcast the information [33]. During one step, each agent has a communication occurrence. As agents do not have much time to communicate, such a communication occurrence must not have a too big temporal complexity, which we can prove formally: Proposition 1. The temporal complexity of a communication occurrence at time t ∈ T between two agents si and sj is, for agent si, O(|Rt si |.|Rt sj |.|S|2 ) Proof 1. For the worst case, each agent sk sends |Rt sk | pieces of information on requests and |Rt sk |.|S| pieces of informations on candidacies (one candidacy for each request and for each agent of the swarm). Let si and sj two agents meeting at time t ∈ T. For agent si, the complexity of Protocol 1 is O(|Rt si | + |Rt si |.|S| | {z } emission + |Rt sj | + |Rt sj |.|S| | {z } reception ) For each received piece of information, agent si uses Protocol 3 and searches through its knowledge bases: |Rt si | pieces of information for each received request and |Rt si |.|S| pieces of 2 Communicating endlessly without converging. information for each received candidacy. Consequently, the complexity of Protocol 3 is O(|Rt sj |.|Rt si | + |Rt sj |.|Rt si |.|S|2 ) Thus, the temporal complexity of a communication occurrence is: O(|Rt si | + |Rt si |.|S| + |Rt sj |.|Rt si | + |Rt sj |.|Rt si |.|S|2 )) Then: O(|Rt si |.|Rt sj |.|S|2 ) 5. ON-BOARD PLANNING In space contexts, [5, 21, 6] present multi-agent architectures for on-board planning. However, they assume high communication and computation capabilities [10]. [13] relax these constraints by cleaving planning modules: on the first hand, satellites have a planner that builds plans on a large horizon and on the second hand, they have a decision module that enables them to choose to realize or not a planned observation. In an uncertain environment such as the one of satellite swarms, it may be advantageous to delay the decision until the last moment (i.e. the realization date), especially if there are several possibilities for a given request. The main idea in contingency planning [15, 29] is to determine the nodes in the initial plan where the risks of failures are most important and to incrementally build contingency branches for these situations. 5.1 A deliberative approach Inspired from both approaches, we propose to build allocations made up of a set of unquestionable requests and a set of uncertain disjunctive requests on which a decision will be made at the end of the decision horizon. This horizon corresponds to the request realization date. Proposing such partial allocations allows conflicts to be solved locally without propagating them through the whole plan. In order to build the agents initial plans, let us assume that each agent is equipped with an on-board planner. A plan is defined as follows: Definition 6 (Plan). Let si be an agent, Rt si a set of requests and Ct si a set of candidacies. Let us define three sets: - the set of potential requests: Rp = {R ∈ Rt si |bR = false} - the set of mandatory requests: Rm = {R ∈ Rp |∃C ∈ Ct si : modC = 2, sC = si, RC = R} - the set of given-up requests: Rg = {R ∈ Rp |∃C ∈ Ct si : modC = ¬2, sC = si, RC = R} A plan At si generated at time t ∈ T is a set of requests such as Rm ⊆ At si ⊆ Rp and ∃ R ∈ Rg such as R ∈ At si . Building a plan generates candidacies. Definition 7 (Generating candidacies). Let si be an agent and At1 si a (possibly empty) plan at time t1. Let At2 si be the plan generated at time t2 with t2 > t1. - ∀ R ∈ At1 si such as R ∈ At2 si , a candidacy C such as mod(C) = ¬3, sC = si and RC = R is generated; - ∀ R ∈ At2 si such as R ∈ At1 si , a candidacy C such as mod(C) = 3, sC = si and RC = R is generated; - Protocol 2 is used to update Kt1 si in Kt2 si . 290 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 5.2 Conflicts When two agents compare their respective plans some conflicts may appear. It is a matter of redundancies between allocations on a given request, i.e.: several agents stand as candidates to carry out this request. Whereas such redundancies may sometimes be useful to ensure the realization of a request (the realization may fail, e.g. because of clouds), it may also lead to a loss of opportunity. Consequently, conflict has to be defined: Definition 8 (Conflict). Let si and sj be two agents with, at time t, candidacies Csi and Csj respectively (sCsi = si and sCsj = sj). si and sj are in conflict if and only if: - RCsi = RCsj - modCsi and modCsj ∈ {2, 3} Let us notice that the agents have the means to know whether they are in conflict with another one during the communication process. Indeed, they exchange information not only concerning their own plan but also concerning what they know about the other agents plans. All the conflicts do not have the same strength, meaning that they can be solved with more or less difficulty according to the agents communication capacities. A conflict is soft when the concerned agents can communicate before one or the other carries out the request in question. A conflict is hard when the agents cannot communicate before the realization of the request. Definition 9 (Soft/Hard conflict). Let si and sj (i < j) two agents in conflict with, at time t, candidacies Csi and Csj respectively (sCsi = si and sCsj = sj). If ∃ V ⊆ S such as V = {si . . . sj} and if ∃ T ∈ T such as T = {ti−1 . . . tj−1} (ti−1 = t) where: ∀ i ≤ k <j, sk+1 ∈ Vicinity(sk, tk) with tk < obsCsi , tk < obsCsj and tk ≥ tk−1 then the conflict is soft else it is hard. A conflict is soft if it exists a chain of agents between the two agents in conflict such as information can propagate before both agents realize the request. If this chain does not exist, it means that the agents in conflict cannot communicate directly or not. Consequently, the conflict is hard. In satellite swarms, the geographical positions of the requests are known as well as the satellite orbits. So each agent is able to determine if a conflict is soft or hard. We can define the conflict cardinality: Definition 10 (Conflict cardinality). Let si be an agent and R a request in conflict. The conflict cardinality is cardc(R) = |{C ∈ Ct si |modC ∈ {2, 3}, CR = R}|. The conflict cardinality corresponds to the number of agents that are candidates or committed to the same request. Thus, a conflict has at least a cardinality of 2. 6. COLLABORATION STRATEGIES In space contexts, communication time and agents computing capacities are limited. When they are in conflict, the agents must find a local agreement (instead of an expensive global agreement) by using the conflict in order to increase the number of realized requests, to decrease the time of mission return, to increase the quality of the pictures taken or to make sure that a request is carried out. Example 2. Let us suppose a conflict on request R between agents si and sj. We would like that the most expert agent, i.e. the agent that can carry out the request under the best conditions, does it. Let us suppose si is the expert. si must allocate R to itself. It remains to determine what sj must do: sj can either select a substitute for R in order to increase the number of requests potentially realized, or do nothing in order to preserve resources, or allocate R to itself to ensure redundancy. Consequently, we can define collaboration strategies dedicated to conflict solving. A strategy is a private (namely intrinsic to an agent) decision process that allows an agent to make a decision on a given object. In our application, strategies specify what to do with redundancies. 6.1 Cost and expertise In our application, cost is linked to the realization dates. Carrying out a request consumes the agents resources (e.g.: on-board energy, memory). Consequently, an observation has a cost for each agent which depends on when it is realized: the closer the realization date to the desired date of observation, the lower the cost. Definition 11 (Cost). Let si be an agent. The cost costsi (RC ) ∈ R to carry out a request RC according to a candidacy C is defined as: costsi (RC ) = |obsC − tbeg(RC)|. From this cost notion, we can formally define an expert notion between two agents. The expertise for an agent means it can realize the request at the lower cost. Definition 12 (Expertise). Let si and sj ∈ S be two agents and R a request. Agent si is an expert for R if and only if costsi (R) ≤ costsj (R). 6.2 Soft conflict solving strategies Three strategies are proposed to solve a conflict. The expert strategy means that the expert agent maintains its candidacy whereas the other one gives up. The altruist strategy means that the agent that can download first3 , provided the cost increase is negligible, maintains its candidacy whereas the other one gives up. The insurance strategy means that both agents maintain their candidacies in order to ensure redundancy. Strategy 1 (Expert). Let si and sj be two agents in conflict on their respective candidacies Csi and Csj such as si is the expert agent. The expert strategy is: modCsi = 2 and modCsj = ¬2. Strategy 2 (Altruist). Let si and sj be two agents in conflict on their respective candidacies Csi and Csj such as si is the expert agent. Let ∈ R+ be a threshold on the cost increase. The altruist strategy is : if dnlCsi > dnlCsj and |costsi (R) − costsj (R)| < then modCsi = ¬2 and modCsj = 2. Strategy 3 (Insurance). Let si and sj be two agents in conflict on their respective candidacies Csi and Csj such as si is the expert agent. Let α ∈ R be a priority threshold. The insurance strategy is : if prio(R) cardc(R)−1 > α then modCsi = 3 and modCsj = 3. 3 i.e. the agent using memory resources during a shorter time. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 291 In the insurance strategy, redundancy triggering is adjusted by the conflict cardinality cardc(R). The reason is the following: the more redundancies on a given request, the less a new redundancy on this request is needed. The three strategies are implemented in a negotiation protocol dedicated to soft conflicts. The protocol is based on a subsumption architecture [7] on strategies: the insurance strategy (1) is the major strategy because it ensures redundancy for which the swarm is implemented. Then the altruist strategy comes (2) in order to allocate the resources so as to enhance the mission return. Finally, the expert strategy that does not have preconditions (3) enhances the cost of the plan. Protocol 4 (Soft conflict solving). Let R be a request in a soft conflict between two agents, si and sj. These agents have Csi and Csj for respective candidacies. Let si be the expert agent. Agents apply strategies as follows: 1. insurance strategy (α) 2. altruist strategy ( ) 3. expert strategy The choice of parameters α and allows to adjust the protocol results. For example, if = 0, the altruist strategy is never used. 6.3 Hard conflict solving strategies In case of a hard conflict, the agent that is not aware will necessarily realize the request (with success or not). Consequently, a redundancy is useful only if the other agent is more expert or if the priority of the request is high enough to need redundancy. Therefore, we will use the insurance strategy (refer to Section 6.2) and define a competitive strategy. The latter is defined for two agents, si and sj, in a hard conflict on a request R. Let si be the agent that is aware of the conflict4 . Strategy 4 (Competitive). Let λ ∈ R+ be an cost threshold. The competitive strategy is: if costsi (R) < costsj (R) − λ then modCsi = 3. Protocol 5 (Hard conflict solving). Let si be an agent in a hard conflict with an agent sj on a request R. si applies strategies as follows: 1. insurance strategy (α) 2. competitive strategy (λ) 3. withdrawal : modCsi = ¬2 6.4 Generalization Although agents use pair communication, they may have information about several agents and conflict cardinality may be more than 2. Therefore, we define a k-conflict as a conflict with a cardinality of k on a set of agents proposing or committing to realize the same request. Formally, Definition 13 (k-conflict). Let S = {s1 . . . sk} be a set of agents with respective candidacies Cs1 . . . Csk at time t. The set S is in a k-conflict if and only if: - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, sCsi = si; - !∃R such as ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, RCsi = R; 4 i.e. the agent that must make a decision on R. - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, modCsi ∈ {2, 3}. - S is maximal (⊆) among the sets that satisfy these properties. As previously, a k-conflict can be soft or hard. A k-conflict is soft if each pair conflict in the k-conflict is a soft conflict with respect to Definition 9. As conflicts bear on sets of agents, expertise is a total order on agents. We define rank-i-expertise where the concerned agent is the ith expert. In case of a soft k-conflict, the rank-i-expert agent makes its decision with respect to the rank-(i + 1)-expert agent according to Protocol 4. The protocol is applied recursively and α and parameters are updated at each step in order to avoid cost explosion5 . In case of a hard conflict, the set S of agents in conflict can be splitted in SS (the subset of agents in a soft conflict) and SH (the subset of unaware agents). Only agents in SS can take a decision and must adapt themselves to agents in SH . The rank-i-expert agent in SS uses Protocol 5 on the whole set SH and the rank-(i − 1)-expert agent in SS . If an agent in SS applies the competitive strategy all the others withdraws. 7. EXPERIMENTS Satellite swarm simulations have been implemented in JAVA with the JADE platform [3]. The on-board planner is implemented with linear programming using ILOG CPLEX [1]. The simulation scenario implements 3 satellites on 6hour orbits. Two scenarios have been considered: the first one with a set of 40 requests with low mutual exclusion and conflict rate and the second one with a set of 74 requests with high mutual exclusion and conflict rate. For each scenario, six simulations have been performed: one with centralized planning (all requests are planned by the ground station before the simulation), one where agents are isolated (they cannot communicate nor coordinate with one another), one informed simulation (agents only communicate requests) and three other simulations implementing the instanciated collaboration strategies (politics): - neutral politics: α, and λ are set to average values; - drastic politics: α and λ are set to higher values, i.e. agents will ensure redundancy only if the priorities are high and, in case of a hard conflict, if the cost payoff is much higher; - lax politics: α is set to a lower value, i.e. redundancies are more frequent. In the case of low mutual exclusion and conflict rate (Table 1), centralized and isolated simulations lead to the same number of observations, with the same average priorities. Isolation leading to a lower cost is due to the high number of redundancies: many agents carry out the same request at different costs. The informed simulation reduces the number of redundancies but sligthly increases the average cost for the same reason. We can notice that the use of 5 For instance, the rank-1-expert agent withdraws due to the altruist strategy and the cost increases by in the worst case, then rank-2-expert agent withdraws due to the altruist strategy and the cost increases by in the worst case. So the cost has increased by 2 in the worst case. 292 The Sixth Intl.

Furthermore, the average cost is increased too. Nevertheless each avoided redundancy corresponds to saved resources to realize on-board generated requests during the simulation. In the case of high mutual exclusion and conflict rate (Table 2), noteworthy differences exist between the centralized and isolated simulations. We can notice that all informed simulations (with or without strategies) allow to perform more observations than isolated agents do with less redundancies. Likewise, we can notice that all politics reduce the average cost contrary to the first scenario. The drastic politics is interesting because not only does it allow to perform more observations than isolated agents do but it allows to highly reduce the average cost with the lowest number of redundancies. As far as the number of exchanged messages is concerned, there are 12 meetings between 2 agents during the simulations. In the worst case, at each meeting each agent sends N pieces of information on the requests plus 3N pieces of information on the agents intentions plus 1 message for the end of communication, where N is the total number of requests. Consequently, 3864 messages are exchanged in the worst case for the 40-request simulations and 7128 messages for the 74-request simulations. These numbers are much higher than the number of messages that are actually exchanged. We can notice that the informed simulations, that communicate only requests, allow a higher reduction. In the general case, using communication and strategies allows to reduce redundancies and saves resources but increases the average cost: if a request is realized, agents that know it do not plan it even if its cost can be reduce afterwards. It is not the case with isolated agents. Using strategies on little constrained problems such as scenario 1 constrains the agents too much and causes an additional cost increase. Strategies are more useful on highly constrained problems such as scenario 2. Although agents constrain themselves on the number of observations, the average cost is widely reduce. 8. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK An observation satellite swarm is a cooperative multiagent system with strong constraints in terms of communication and computation capabilities. In order to increase the global mission outcome, we propose an hybrid approach: deliberative for individual planning and reactive for collaboration. Agents reason both on requests to carry out and on the other agents intentions (candidacies). An epidemic communication protocol uses all communication opportunities to update this information. Reactive decision rules (strategies) are proposed to solve conflicts that may arise between agents. Through the tuning of the strategies (α, and λ) and their plastic interlacing within the protocol, it is possible to coordinate agents without additional communication: the number of exchanged messages remains nearly the same between informed simulations and simulations implementing strategies. Some simulations have been made to experimentally validate these protocols and the first results are promising but raise many questions. What is the trade-off between the constraint rate of the problem and the need of strategies? To what extent are the number of redundancies and the average cost affected by the tuning of the strategies? Future works will focus on new strategies to solve new conflicts, specially those arising when relaxing the independence assumption between the requests. A second point is to take into account the complexity of the initial planning problem. Indeed, the chosen planning approach results in a combinatory explosion with big sets of requests: an anytime or a fully reactive approach has to be considered for more complex problems.

Nuestro objetivo es definir comportamientos individuales que resulten en un comportamiento global que cumpla con los requisitos de la misión.

Introducción Se ha realizado mucha investigación para aumentar la autonomía satelital, como permitirles resolver por sí mismos, los problemas que pueden ocurrir durante una misión, adaptando su comportamiento a los nuevos eventos y transferir la planificación a bordo;Incluso si el costo de desarrollo de dicho satélite aumenta, hay un aumento en el rendimiento y las posibilidades de misión [34]. Además, el uso de enjambres satelitales: conjuntos de satélites que vuelan en formación o en constelación alrededor de las señales de tierra que es posible considerar las actividades conjuntas, distribuir habilidades y garantizar la robustez. Se han desarrollado arquitecturas de múltiples agentes para enjambres satelitales [36, 38, 42], pero se hacen fuertes supuestos sobre las capacidades de deliberación y comunicación para construir un plan colectivo. La planificación mono-agente [4, 18, 28] y la asignación de tareas [20] están ampliamente estudiadas. En un contexto de múltiples agentes, los agentes que construyen un plan colectivo deben poder cambiar sus objetivos, reasignar recursos y reaccionar a los cambios en el medio ambiente y a las opciones de las demás. Se debe agregar un paso de coordinación al paso de planificación [40, 30, 11]. Sin embargo, este paso necesita altas capacidades de comunicación y cálculo. Por ejemplo, los mecanismos basados en la coalición [37], basados en contratos [35] y todos los mecanismos basados en la negociación [25] necesitan estas capacidades, especialmente en entornos dinámicos. Para relajar las limitaciones de comunicación, se consideran la coordinación basada en normas y convenciones [16] o estrategias [17]. Los agentes de restricción de normas en sus decisiones de tal manera que se reducen las posibilidades de conflictos. Las estrategias son reglas de decisión privadas que permiten a un agente beneficiarse del mundo experto sin comunicación. Sin embargo, todavía se necesita comunicación para compartir información y crear conjeturas y planes colectivos. La comunicación se puede lograr a través de un enfoque estigmérico (a través del entorno) o mediante intercambio de mensajes y un protocolo. Un protocolo define las interacciones entre los agentes y no puede desacoplarse de su objetivo, p.intercambiar información, encontrar una compensación, asignar tareas, etc. Los protocolos pueden verse como una abstracción de una interacción [9]. Pueden estar representados de varias maneras, p. AUML [32] o redes de Petri [23]. Como los protocolos se diseñan originalmente para un solo objetivo, algunas obras tienen como objetivo endurarlos de flexibilidad [8, 26]. Sin embargo, un agente no siempre puede comunicarse con otro agente o las posibilidades de comunicación están restringidas a intervalos de tiempo cortos. El objetivo de este trabajo es utilizar conexiones intersatélites, llamados enlaces intersatélites o ISL, en una constelación de observación de la Tierra inspirada en la misión FUEGO [13, 19], para aumentar la reactividad del sistema y mejorar el retorno global de la misión a través de un híbridoenfoque de agente. A nivel individual, los agentes son deliberativos para crear un plan local, pero a nivel colectivo, utilizan reglas de decisión normativas para coordinar entre sí. Presentaremos las características de nuestro problema, un protocolo de comunicación, un método para la asignación de solicitudes y finalmente, estrategias de colaboración.287 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas 2. Las características del problema Una constelación de satélite de observación es un conjunto de satélites en varias órbitas cuya misión es tomar fotos de varias áreas en la superficie de la Tierra, por ejemplo, puntos calientes correspondientes a volcanes o incendios forestales. El terreno envía las solicitudes de observación de la constelación caracterizadas por sus posiciones geográficas, prioridades que especifican si las solicitudes son urgentes o no, las fechas de observación deseadas y las fechas deseadas para la descarga de datos. Los satélites están equipados con un solo instrumento de observación cuyo espejo puede rodar para cambiar la línea de visión. Es necesaria una duración mínima para mover el espejo, por lo que las solicitudes que están demasiado juntas no pueden ser realizadas por el mismo satélite. Los satélites también están equipados con un instrumento de detección señalado que detecta puntos calientes y genera solicitudes de observación a bordo. Las constelaciones que consideramos son como las órbitas de los diversos satélites que se encuentran alrededor de los polos. Un posicionamiento juicioso de los satélites en sus órbitas hace posible considerar que dos (o más) satélites se encuentran en las áreas polares y, por lo tanto, pueden comunicarse sin la intervención del suelo. Intuitivamente, la comunicación intersatélite aumenta la reactividad de la constelación ya que cada satélite está dentro de la vista directa de una estación terrestre (y por lo tanto puede comunicarse con ella) solo el 10 % del tiempo. Las características del problema son las siguientes: - 3 a 20 satélites en la constelación;- Emparejar la comunicación alrededor de los polos;- No hay intervención terrestre durante el proceso de planificación;- Solicitudes asíncronas con diversas prioridades.3. Un enfoque de múltiples agentes ya que cada satélite es una entidad única que es una pieza del enjambre global, un sistema de múltiples agentes se ajusta para modelar constelaciones satelitales [39]. Este enfoque se ha desarrollado a través de la arquitectura Objectagent [38], Teamagent [31], DIPS [14] o Ants Phoficing [12].3.1 Swarm de satélite Un satélite de observación Swarm1 es un sistema de múltiples agentes donde las solicitudes no tienen que llevarse a cabo en un orden fijo y los agentes (los satélites) no tienen ninguna interacción física. Realizar una solicitud no puede evitar que otro agente realice otro, incluso el mismo. A lo sumo, habrá un desperdicio de recursos. Formalmente, un enjambre se define de la siguiente manera: Definición 1 (enjambre). Un enjambre satelital E es un triplete <S, T, vecindad>: - S es un conjunto de n agentes {S1...sn};- T ⊆ R+ o N+ es un conjunto de fechas con un orden total <;- Vicinidad: S × T → 2S. En la secuela, asumiremos que los agentes comparten un reloj común. Para un agente determinado y un momento determinado, la relación vecindad devuelve el conjunto de agentes con los que puede comunicarse en ese momento. Como hemos visto anteriormente, esta relación existe cuando los agentes se encuentran.1 Este término designará una constelación satelital con enlaces entre satélites.3.2 Solicitudes Las solicitudes son las tareas de observación que el enjambre satelital debe lograr. Como hemos visto anteriormente, las solicitudes se generan tanto en el terreno como a bordo. A cada agente se le asigna un conjunto de solicitudes iniciales. Durante la misión, el terreno envía nuevas solicitudes a los agentes o los agentes pueden generar nuevas solicitudes por sí mismas. Formalmente, una solicitud se define de la siguiente manera: Definición 2 (solicitud). Una solicitud R se define como una tuple <idr, pos (r), prio (r), tbeg (r), br>: - idr es un identificador;- Pos (R) es la posición geográfica de R;- Prio (r) ∈ R es la prioridad de solicitud;- tbeg (r) ∈ T es la fecha de observación deseada;- Br ∈ {verdadero, falso} especifica si R se ha realizado. La prioridad prio (R) de una solicitud representa cuánto es importante para el usuario, a saber, el remitente de solicitud, que la solicitud debe llevarse a cabo. Por lo tanto, se debe realizar una solicitud con alta prioridad a toda costa. En nuestra aplicación, las prioridades se comprenden entre 1 y 5 (la más alta). En la secuela, observaremos RT SI el conjunto de las solicitudes que son conocidas por el agente si en el tiempo t ∈ T. Para cada solicitud r en rt si, hay un valor de costo, anotado costosi (r) ∈ R, que representa cómoLejos de la fecha de observación deseada TBEG (R) Un agente SI puede darse cuenta de R. Por lo tanto, cuanto más un agente pueda llevar a cabo una solicitud en las cercanías de la fecha de observación deseada, menor es el valor de costo.3.3 Candidatura Un agente puede tener varias intenciones sobre una solicitud, es decir, para una solicitud R, un agente si puede: - Proponga llevar a cabo R: Si puede darse cuenta de R;- Comprometerse a llevar a cabo R: Si se dará cuenta de R;- No proponga llevar a cabo R: Si puede no darse cuenta de R;- Negarse a llevar a cabo R: SI no se dará cuenta de R. Podemos notar que estas cuatro proposiciones son modalidades de la Proposición C: Si se da cuenta de R: - 3C significa que Si propone llevar a cabo R;- 2c significa que Si se compromete a llevar a cabo R;- ¬3c significa que Si no propone llevar a cabo R;- ¬2c significa que Si se niega a llevar a cabo R. más formalmente: definición 3 (candidatura). Una candidatura C es una tuple <idc, modc, sc, rc, obsc, dnlc>: - idc es un identificador;- modc ∈ {3, 2, ¬3, ¬2} es una modalidad;- Sc ∈ S es el agente candidato;- rc ∈ Rt SC es la solicitud sobre la cual los candidatos SC;- Obsc ∈ T es la fecha de realización propuesta por SC;- dnlc ∈ T es la fecha de descarga.3.4 Formalización del problema Entonces, nuestro problema es el siguiente: nos gustaría que cada agente cree asignaciones de solicitudes (es decir, un plan) dinámicamente, como si estas solicitudes se llevan a cabo, su número es el más alto posible o el costo global es mínimo. Más formalmente, definición 4 (problema). Sea E un enjambre. Los agentes SI en E deben construir un conjunto {en S1... En sn} donde en si ⊆ rt si 288 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) AS: - |S si∈S en Si |es máximo;P SI∈S P r∈At si Prio (R) es máximo. P SI∈S P r∈At si costi (r) es mínimo. Observemos que estos criterios no son necesariamente compatibles. Como las elecciones de un agente estarán influenciadas por las elecciones de los demás, es necesario que los agentes razonen sobre un conocimiento común sobre las solicitudes. Por lo tanto, es necesario establecer un protocolo de comunicación efectivo.4. Protocolo de comunicación La comunicación se asocia comúnmente con la cooperación. Los agentes deliberativos necesitan comunicación para cooperar, mientras que no es necesariamente el caso de los agentes reactivos [2, 41]. Los protocolos de chismes [22, 24], o protocolos epidémicos, se utilizan para compartir conocimiento con multidifusión. Cada agente selecciona un conjunto de agentes en un momento dado para compartir información. La velocidad de la transmisión de la información depende de la longitud de la ronda de discusión.4.1 La metáfora del corredor El protocolo sugerido está inspirado desde lo que llamamos la metáfora del corredor, que representa bien el problema del enjambre de satélite. Varios agentes van y vienen a un corredor donde los objetos para recolectar aparecen de vez en cuando. El mismo agente no puede recolectar dos objetos que están demasiado cerca uno del otro, porque la acción lleva algún tiempo y un agente no puede detener su movimiento. Para optimizar la colección, los agentes pueden comunicarse cuando se encuentran. S 2 S ABEL A 1 A 3S Figura 1: Tiempo T 1 S 2s BEL Non A 3S Figura 2: Tiempo T Ejemplo 1. Supongamos que tres agentes, S1, S2, S3 y un objeto A se recolectan. En el momento T, S1 no recolectó A y S2 no saben que A existe. Cuando S1 se encuentra con S2, comunica la lista de los objetos que sabe, es decir, A. S2 ahora cree que A existe y se prepara para recolectarlo. No es seguro que A todavía esté allí porque otro agente puede haber pasado antes de S2, pero puede tenerlo en cuenta en su plan. En el momento t, S3 recoge A. En la vecindad de S2, S3 comunica su lista de objetos y A no está en la lista. Como ambos agentes se encuentran en un lugar donde es posible que S3 haya recopilado A, el objeto habría estado en la lista si no se hubiera recopilado.Por lo tanto, S2 puede creer que A ya no existe y puede retirarlo de su plan.4.2 Conocimiento Para comunicarse para construir sus planes, los agentes necesitan conocer las solicitudes actuales y las otras intenciones de los agentes. Para cada agente se definen dos tipos de conocimiento de mantenimiento: - Solicitudes (Definición 2);- Candidacies (Definición 3). Definición 5 (conocimiento). El conocimiento k es una tupla <data (k), sk, tk>: - los datos (k) es una solicitud r o una candidatura c;- Sk ⊆ s es el conjunto de agentes que conocen k;- tk ∈ T es una marca de tiempo temporal. En la secuela, observaremos KT SI el conocimiento del agente Si en el momento t ∈ T. 4.3 Un protocolo epidémico de la metáfora del corredor, podemos definir un protocolo de comunicación que se beneficie de todas las oportunidades de comunicación. Un agente notifica cualquier cambio dentro de su conocimiento y cada agente debe propagar estos cambios en su vecindad que actualiza sus bases de conocimiento y reiteran el proceso. Este protocolo es una variante de los protocolos epidémicos [22] inspirados en el trabajo sobre la escucha [27]. Protocolo 1 (comunicación). Deje que Si sea un agente en S. ∀t ∈ T: - ∀ Sj ∈ Vicinidad (Si, T), Si se ejecuta: 1. ∀ k ∈ Kt Si como Sj ∈ Sk: a.Si comunica K a SJ b.Si SJ reconoce la recepción de K, SK ← SK ∪ {SJ}.- ∀ k ∈ Kt Si recibido por SJ en el tiempo t: 1. SJ actualiza KT SJ con K 2. SJ reconoce la recepción de K a Si. Existen dos tipos de actualizaciones para un agente: - Una actualización interna de una modificación de conocimiento del propio agente;- Una actualización externa del conocimiento recibido. Para una actualización interna, la actualización K depende de los datos (k): una candidatura C se modifica cuando su modalidad cambia y una solicitud R se modifica cuando un agente se da cuenta. Cuando se actualiza K, la marca de tiempo también se actualiza. Protocolo 2 (actualización interna). Deje que Si ∈ S sea un agente. Se realiza una actualización interna de Si en el momento t ∈ T: - Cuando se crea el conocimiento k;- Cuando los datos (k) se modifican. En ambos casos: 1. Tk ← T;2. SK ← {Si}. Para una actualización externa, solo el conocimiento más reciente se tiene en cuenta porque las marcas de tiempo cambian solo cuando los datos (k) se modifican. Si K ya se conoce, se actualiza si el contenido o el conjunto de agentes que lo saben han sido modificados. Si K es desconocido, simplemente se agrega al conocimiento de los agentes. Protocolo 3 (actualización externa). Deje que SI sea un agente y K el conocimiento transmitido por el Agente SJ.∀ k ∈ K, la actualización externa en el tiempo t ∈ T se define de la siguiente manera: 1. Si ∃ k ∈ Kt si como iddata (k) = iddata (k) entonces a.Si tk ≥ tk entonces i.Si tk> tk entonces SK ← SK ∪ {Si} II.Si tk = tk entonces SK ← SK ∪ SK III. Kt si ← (kt si \\ {k}) ∪ {k} 2. else a.Kt si ← Kt Si ∪ {K} b.SK ← SK ∪ {Si} El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 289 Si la información entrante tiene una marca de tiempo más reciente, significa que el agente receptor tiene información obsoleta. En consecuencia, reemplaza la información anterior del nuevo y se suma al conjunto de agentes que conocen k (1.A.I). Si ambas marcas de tiempo son las mismas, ambas piezas de información son las mismas. Solo el conjunto de agentes sabiendo que K puede haber cambiado porque los agentes SI y SJ pueden haber transmitido la información a otros agentes. En consecuencia, los conjuntos de agentes que saben K están unificados (1.a.ii).4.4 Propiedades La comunicación entre dos agentes cuando se encuentran se realiza de la conjunción del Protocolo 1 y el Protocolo 3. En la secuela, llamamos a esta conjunción una ocurrencia de comunicación.4.4.1 Convergencia La estructura de la información transmitida y el mecanismo de actualización interna (Protocolo 2) permiten que el proceso converja. De hecho, una solicitud R solo puede estar en dos estados (realizados o no) dada por el BR. Una vez que se realiza una actualización interna, es decir, R se realiza: R no puede volver a su estado anterior. En consecuencia, una actualización interna solo se puede realizar una vez. En lo que respecta a las candidaturas, las actualizaciones solo modifican las modalidades, que pueden cambiar muchas veces y volver a los estados anteriores. Entonces parece que es probable que aparezca Livernocks2. Sin embargo, una candidatura C está asociada a una solicitud y una fecha de realización (la fecha límite dada por OBSC). Después de la fecha límite, la candidatura no tiene sentido. Por lo tanto, para cada candidatura, existe una fecha t ∈ T cuando los cambios no se propagarán más.4.4.2 Complejidad Se ha demostrado que en un conjunto de n agentes donde uno solo tiene una nueva información, un protocolo epidémico toma los pasos O (logn) para transmitir la información [33]. Durante un paso, cada agente tiene una ocurrencia de comunicación. Como los agentes no tienen mucho tiempo para comunicarse, tal ocurrencia de comunicación no debe tener una complejidad temporal demasiado grande, lo que podemos probar formalmente: la Proposición 1. La complejidad temporal de una aparición de comunicación en el tiempo t ∈ T entre dos agentes Si y SJ es, para el agente Si, o (| rt si |. | Rt sj |. | S | 2) Prueba 1. Para el peor de los casos, cada agente SK envía | RT SK |piezas de información sobre solicitudes y | rt sk |. | S |Piezas de información sobre candidatura (una candidatura para cada solicitud y para cada agente del enjambre). Deje que SI y SJ dos agentes se encuentren en el tiempo t ∈ T. Para el agente Si, la complejidad del protocolo 1 es o (| rt si | + | rt si |. | S | | {z} emisión + | rt sj | + |RT SJ |.piezas de información para cada solicitud recibida y | rt Si |. | S |Piezas de 2 se comunican sin cesar sin converger.información para cada candidatura recibida. En consecuencia, la complejidad del protocolo 3 es o (| rt sj |. | Rt si | + | rt sj |. | Rt si |.Si | + | rt Si |.|. | S | 2) 5. Planificación a bordo en contextos espaciales, [5, 21, 6] presentan arquitecturas de múltiples agentes para la planificación a bordo. Sin embargo, asumen altas capacidades de comunicación y cálculo [10].[13] Relaja estas limitaciones módulos de planificación de escisión: por primera mano, los satélites tienen un planificador que construye planes en un horizonte grande y, de segunda mano, tienen un módulo de decisión que les permite elegir o no una observación planificada. En un entorno incierto, como el de los enjambres satelitales, puede ser ventajoso retrasar la decisión hasta el último momento (es decir, la fecha de realización), especialmente si hay varias posibilidades para una solicitud dada. La idea principal en la planificación de contingencias [15, 29] es determinar los nodos en el plan inicial donde los riesgos de fallas son más importantes y construir ramas de contingencia incrementales para estas situaciones.5.1 Un enfoque deliberativo inspirado en ambos enfoques, proponemos construir asignaciones compuestas por un conjunto de solicitudes incuestionables y un conjunto de solicitudes disyuntivas inciertas sobre las cuales se tomará una decisión al final del horizonte de decisión. Este horizonte corresponde a la fecha de realización de la solicitud. Proponer tales asignaciones parciales permite que los conflictos se resuelvan localmente sin propagarlos a través de todo el plan. Para construir los planes iniciales de los agentes, supongamos que cada agente está equipado con un planificador a bordo. Un plan se define de la siguiente manera: Definición 6 (Plan). Deje que SI sea un agente, rt si un conjunto de solicitudes y ct si un conjunto de candidatura. Definamos tres conjuntos: - El conjunto de solicitudes potenciales: rp = {r ∈ Rt si | br = falso} - el conjunto de solicitudes obligatorias: rm = {r ∈ Rp | ∃c ∈ Ct Si: modc = 2, sc= si, rc = r} - el conjunto de solicitudes dadas: rg = {r ∈ Rp | ∃c ∈ Ct si: modc = ¬2, sc = si, rc = r} un plan en Si generado t∈ T es un conjunto de solicitudes como RM ⊆ en Si ⊆ RP y ∃ R ∈ Rg como r ∈ en Si. Construir un plan genera candidatura. Definición 7 (generador de candidianzas). Deje que SI sea un agente y AT1 Si A (posiblemente vacío) en el tiempo T1. Deje que AT2 SI sea el plan generado en el tiempo T2 con T2> T1.- ∀ r ∈ At1 Si como r ∈ At2 Si, una candidatura c como mod (c) = ¬3, sc = si y rc = r se genera;- ∀ r ∈ At2 Si como r ∈ At1 Si, se genera una candidatura c como mod (c) = 3, sc = si y rc = r;- El protocolo 2 se utiliza para actualizar KT1 SI en KT2 SI.290 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 5.2 Conflictos Cuando dos agentes comparan sus respectivos planes, pueden aparecer algunos conflictos. Es una cuestión de redundancias entre asignaciones en una solicitud dada, es decir,: varios agentes son candidatos para llevar a cabo esta solicitud. Mientras que tales redundancias a veces pueden ser útiles para garantizar la realización de una solicitud (la realización puede fallar, por ejemplo, debido a las nubes), también puede conducir a una pérdida de oportunidades. En consecuencia, el conflicto debe definirse: definición 8 (conflicto). Deje que Si y SJ sean dos agentes con, en el tiempo t, candidacies CSI y CSJ respectivamente (scSi = si y scsj = sj).SI y SJ están en conflicto si y solo si: - rcsi = rcsj - modcsi y modcsj ∈ {2, 3} notemos que los agentes tienen los medios para saber si están en conflicto con otro durante el proceso de comunicación. De hecho, intercambian información no solo con respecto a su propio plan sino también con respecto a lo que saben sobre los planes de otros agentes. Todos los conflictos no tienen la misma fuerza, lo que significa que pueden resolverse con más o menos dificultad de acuerdo con las capacidades de comunicación de los agentes. Un conflicto es suave cuando los agentes en cuestión pueden comunicarse antes de que uno u otro realice la solicitud en cuestión. Un conflicto es difícil cuando los agentes no pueden comunicarse antes de la realización de la solicitud. Definición 9 (conflicto suave/duro). Deje que SI y SJ (i <j) en conflicto con, en el momento t, candidacias CSI y CSJ respectivamente (scSi = si y scsj = sj). Si ∃ V ⊆ s como V = {Si...sj} y si ∃ t ∈ T como t = {ti - 1...tj - 1} (ti - 1 = t) donde: ∀ i ≤ k <j, sk+1 ∈ Vicinidad (SK, TK) con Tk <obscsi, tk <obscsj y tk ≥ tk - 1 entonces el conflicto es suavees difícil. Un conflicto es suave si existe una cadena de agentes entre los dos agentes en conflicto, como la información, puede propagarse antes de que ambos agentes se den cuenta de la solicitud. Si esta cadena no existe, significa que los agentes en conflicto no pueden comunicarse directamente o no. En consecuencia, el conflicto es difícil. En los enjambres satelitales, las posiciones geográficas de las solicitudes se conocen, así como las órbitas satelitales. Entonces, cada agente puede determinar si un conflicto es suave o duro. Podemos definir la cardinalidad del conflicto: definición 10 (cardinalidad de conflicto). Deje que SI sea un agente y una solicitud en conflicto. La cardinalidad de conflicto es cardc (r) = | {c ∈ Ct si | modc ∈ {2, 3}, cr = r} |. La cardinalidad de conflicto corresponde al número de agentes que son candidatos o comprometidos con la misma solicitud. Por lo tanto, un conflicto tiene al menos una cardinalidad de 2. 6. Las estrategias de colaboración en los contextos espaciales, el tiempo de comunicación y las capacidades informáticas de los agentes son limitadas. Cuando están en conflicto, los agentes deben encontrar un acuerdo local (en lugar de un acuerdo global costoso) utilizando el conflicto para aumentar el número de solicitudes realizadas, para disminuir el tiempo de retorno de la misión, para aumentar la calidad de las imágenestomado o para asegurarse de que se realice una solicitud. Ejemplo 2. Supongamos que un conflicto a pedido R entre los agentes SI y SJ. Nos gustaría que el agente más experto, es decir, el agente que puede llevar a cabo la solicitud en las mejores condiciones, lo hace. Supongamos que SI es el experto.Si debe asignar R a sí mismo. Queda por determinar qué debe hacer SJ: SJ puede seleccionar un sustituto de R para aumentar el número de solicitudes potencialmente realizadas, o no hacer nada para preservar los recursos, o asignarse a R para garantizar la redundancia. En consecuencia, podemos definir estrategias de colaboración dedicadas a la resolución de conflictos. Una estrategia es un proceso de decisión privado (a saber, intrínseco para un agente) que permite a un agente tomar una decisión sobre un objeto determinado. En nuestra aplicación, las estrategias especifican qué hacer con los despidos.6.1 Costo y experiencia En nuestra aplicación, el costo está vinculado a las fechas de realización. Realizar una solicitud consume los recursos de los agentes (por ejemplo .: Energía a bordo, memoria). En consecuencia, una observación tiene un costo para cada agente que depende de cuándo se realiza: cuanto más cerca sea la fecha de realización de la fecha de observación deseada, menor será el costo. Definición 11 (costo). Sea un agente. El costo costos (RC) ∈ R para llevar a cabo una solicitud RC de acuerdo con una candidatura C se define como: Cossi (RC) = | Obsc - tbeg (RC) |. A partir de esta noción de costo, podemos definir formalmente una noción experta entre dos agentes. La experiencia para un agente significa que puede realizar la solicitud al menor costo. Definición 12 (experiencia). Deje que Si y Sj ∈ S sean dos agentes y R una solicitud. Agent SI es un experto para R si y solo si costosi (r) ≤ costosj (r).6.2 Estrategias de resolución de conflictos blandos Se proponen tres estrategias para resolver un conflicto. La estrategia experta significa que el agente experto mantiene su candidatura, mientras que el otro se da por vencido. La estrategia altruista significa que el agente que puede descargar First3, siempre que el aumento de costos sea insignificante, mantiene su candidatura, mientras que el otro se rinde. La estrategia de seguro significa que ambos agentes mantienen sus candidatos para garantizar la redundancia. Estrategia 1 (experta). Deje que SI y SJ sean dos agentes en conflicto en sus respectivas candidaturas CSI y CSJ como SI es el agente experto. La estrategia experta es: modcsi = 2 y modcsj = ¬2. Estrategia 2 (altruista). Deje que SI y SJ sean dos agentes en conflicto en sus respectivas candidaturas CSI y CSJ como SI es el agente experto. Sea ∈ R+ un umbral en el aumento de costos. La estrategia altruista es: si dnlcsi> dnlcsj y | costosi (r) - costosj (r) |<Entonces modcsi = ¬2 y modcsj = 2. Estrategia 3 (seguro). Deje que SI y SJ sean dos agentes en conflicto en sus respectivas candidaturas CSI y CSJ como SI es el agente experto. Deje que α ∈ R sea un umbral de prioridad. La estrategia de seguro es: si Prio (R) CardC (R) −1> α, entonces MODCSI = 3 y MODCSJ = 3. 3, es decir, el agente que usa recursos de memoria durante un tiempo más corto. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 291 En la estrategia de seguro, la activación de redundancia se ajusta por el conflicto Cardinality CardC (R). La razón es la siguiente: cuanto más despido en una solicitud dada, menos se necesita una nueva redundancia en esta solicitud. Las tres estrategias se implementan en un protocolo de negociación dedicado a conflictos blandos. El protocolo se basa en una arquitectura de subsunción [7] en estrategias: la estrategia de seguro (1) es la estrategia principal porque garantiza la redundancia para la cual se implementa el enjambre. Entonces la estrategia altruista viene (2) para asignar los recursos para mejorar el retorno de la misión. Finalmente, la estrategia experta que no tiene condiciones previas (3) mejora el costo del plan. Protocolo 4 (resolución de conflictos suaves). Sea R una solicitud en un conflicto suave entre dos agentes, SI y SJ. Estos agentes tienen CSI y CSJ para las candidaturas respectivas. Deje que SI sea el agente experto. Los agentes aplican estrategias de la siguiente manera: 1. Estrategia de seguro (α) 2. Estrategia altruista () 3. Estrategia experta La elección de los parámetros α y permite ajustar los resultados del protocolo. Por ejemplo, si = 0, la estrategia altruista nunca se usa.6.3 Estrategias de resolución de conflictos difíciles En caso de un conflicto duro, el agente que no es consciente necesariamente se dará cuenta de la solicitud (con éxito o no). En consecuencia, una redundancia es útil solo si el otro agente es más experto o si la prioridad de la solicitud es lo suficientemente alta como para necesitar redundancia. Por lo tanto, utilizaremos la estrategia de seguro (consulte la Sección 6.2) y definiremos una estrategia competitiva. Este último se define para dos agentes, SI y SJ, en un conflicto duro en una solicitud R. Que SI sea el agente que conoce el conflicto4. Estrategia 4 (competitiva). Sea λ ∈ R+ un umbral de costo. La estrategia competitiva es: si costosi (r) <costosj (r) - λ entonces modcsi = 3. Protocolo 5 (resolución de conflictos duros). Deje que SI sea un agente en un conflicto duro con un agente SJ en una solicitud R. SI aplica estrategias de la siguiente manera: 1. Estrategia de seguro (α) 2. Estrategia competitiva (λ) 3. Retiro: MODCSI = ¬2 6.4 Generalización Aunque agentesUse la comunicación de pares, pueden tener información sobre varios agentes y la cardinalidad de conflictos puede ser más de 2. Por lo tanto, definimos un conflicto K como un conflicto con una cardinalidad de K en un conjunto de agentes que proponen o se comprometen a realizar la misma solicitud. Formalmente, Definición 13 (K-Conflict). Sea S = {S1...SK} Sea un conjunto de agentes con respectivas candidatura CS1... CSK en el momento t.El conjunto S está en un conflicto k si y solo si: - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, scsi = si;-! ∃r como ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, rcsi = r;4, es decir, el agente que debe tomar una decisión sobre R. - ∀1 ≤ i ≤ k, modcsi ∈ {2, 3}.- S es máximo (⊆) entre los conjuntos que satisfacen estas propiedades. Como anteriormente, un conflicto K puede ser suave o duro. Un conflicto K es suave si cada par en conflicto en el conflicto K es un conflicto suave con respecto a la definición 9. A medida que los conflictos tienen conjuntos de agentes, la experiencia es una orden total sobre los agentes. Definimos la experiencia de rango-i donde el agente en cuestión es el experto II. En el caso de un conflicto K suave, el agente de rango-i-experto toma su decisión con respecto al agente de rango (i + 1)-experto según el protocolo 4. El protocolo se aplica de manera recursiva y α y los parámetros se actualizan en cada paso para evitar la explosión de costos5. En el caso de un conflicto duro, el conjunto de agentes en conflicto puede dividirse en SS (el subconjunto de agentes en un conflicto suave) y SH (el subconjunto de agentes desconocidos). Solo los agentes en las SS pueden tomar una decisión y deben adaptarse a los agentes en SH. El agente Rank-I-Expert en SS utiliza el Protocolo 5 en todo el conjunto SH y el agente de rango (i-1)-experto en SS. Si un agente en SS aplica la estrategia competitiva, todos los demás se retiran.7. Experimentos Se han implementado simulaciones de enjambre satelitales en Java con la plataforma Jade [3]. El planificador a bordo se implementa con programación lineal utilizando ILOG CPLEX [1]. El escenario de simulación implementa 3 satélites en órbitas de 6 horas. Se han considerado dos escenarios: el primero con un conjunto de 40 solicitudes con baja exclusión mutua y tasa de conflicto y la segunda con un conjunto de 74 solicitudes con alta exclusión mutua y tasa de conflicto. Para cada escenario, se han realizado seis simulaciones: una con planificación centralizada (la estación terrestre planifica todas las solicitudes antes de la simulación), una en la que los agentes están aislados (no pueden comunicarse ni coordinar entre sí), una simulación informada (solo agentescomunicar solicitudes) y otras tres simulaciones que implementan las estrategias de colaboración instanciadas (política): - Política neutral: α y λ se establecen en valores promedio;- Política drástica: α y λ se establecen en valores más altos, es decir, los agentes asegurarán la redundancia solo si las prioridades son altas y, en caso de un conflicto duro, si el pago de costos es mucho más alto;- Política laxa: α se establece en un valor más bajo, es decir, los despidos son más frecuentes. En el caso de baja exclusión mutua y tasa de conflicto (Tabla 1), las simulaciones centralizadas y aisladas conducen al mismo número de observaciones, con las mismas prioridades promedio. El aislamiento que conduce a un costo más bajo se debe al alto número de despidos: muchos agentes llevan a cabo la misma solicitud a diferentes costos. La simulación informada reduce el número de redundancias, pero aumenta el costo promedio por la misma razón. Podemos notar que el uso de 5, por ejemplo, el agente Rank-1-Expert se retira debido a la estrategia altruista y al costo aumenta en el peor de los casos, luego se retira el agente Rank-2-Expert debido a la estrategia altruista y al costoaumenta en el peor de los casos. Por lo tanto, el costo ha aumentado en 2 en el peor de los casos.292 El sexto intl.

Además, el costo promedio también aumenta. Sin embargo, cada uno evitó la redundancia corresponde a recursos guardados para realizar solicitudes generadas a bordo durante la simulación. En el caso de alta exclusión mutua y tasa de conflicto (Tabla 2), existen diferencias notables entre las simulaciones centralizadas y aisladas. Podemos notar que todas las simulaciones informadas (con o sin estrategias) permiten realizar más observaciones que los agentes aislados con menos despido. Del mismo modo, podemos notar que todas las políticas reducen el costo promedio contrario al primer escenario. La política drástica es interesante porque no solo permite realizar más observaciones que los agentes aislados, sino que permite reducir altamente el costo promedio con el menor número de redundancias. En lo que respecta al número de mensajes intercambiados, hay 12 reuniones entre 2 agentes durante las simulaciones. En el peor de los casos, en cada reunión, cada agente envía n información sobre las solicitudes más 3N Pieces de información sobre las intenciones de los agentes más 1 mensaje para el final de la comunicación, donde n es el número total de solicitudes. En consecuencia, 3864 mensajes se intercambian en el peor de los casos por las simulaciones de 40 solicitudes y 7128 mensajes para las simulaciones de 74 solicitudes. Estos números son mucho más altos que el número de mensajes que realmente se intercambian. Podemos notar que las simulaciones informadas, que comunican solo las solicitudes, permiten una mayor reducción. En el caso general, el uso de la comunicación y las estrategias permite reducir los despidos y ahorra recursos, pero aumenta el costo promedio: si se realiza una solicitud, los agentes que lo saben no lo planean, incluso si su costo se puede reducir después. No es el caso con agentes aislados. El uso de estrategias en pequeños problemas limitados, como el escenario 1, limita demasiado a los agentes y causa un aumento de costos adicional. Las estrategias son más útiles en problemas altamente limitados, como el escenario 2. Aunque los agentes se limitan a sí mismos en el número de observaciones, el costo promedio se reduce ampliamente.8. Conclusión y trabajo futuro Un enjambre de satélite de observación es un sistema cooperativo multiagente con fuertes restricciones en términos de capacidades de comunicación y cálculo. Para aumentar el resultado de la misión global, proponemos un enfoque híbrido: deliberativo para la planificación individual y el reactivo para la colaboración. Los agentes razonan tanto las solicitudes para llevar a cabo y sobre las intenciones de los otros agentes (candidatura). Un protocolo de comunicación epidémica utiliza todas las oportunidades de comunicación para actualizar esta información. Se proponen reglas de decisión reactiva (estrategias) para resolver conflictos que pueden surgir entre los agentes. A través del ajuste de las estrategias (α y λ) y su entrelazamiento de plástico dentro del protocolo, es posible coordinar a los agentes sin comunicación adicional: el número de mensajes intercambiados sigue siendo casi el mismo entre simulaciones informadas y estrategias de implementación de simulaciones. Se han realizado algunas simulaciones para validar experimentalmente estos protocolos y los primeros resultados son prometedores, pero plantean muchas preguntas. ¿Cuál es la compensación entre la tasa de restricción del problema y la necesidad de estrategias? ¿Hasta qué punto el número de redundancias y el costo promedio afectado por el ajuste de las estrategias? Los trabajos futuros se centrarán en nuevas estrategias para resolver nuevos conflictos, especialmente los que surgen al relajar la suposición de independencia entre las solicitudes. Un segundo punto es tener en cuenta la complejidad del problema de planificación inicial. De hecho, el enfoque de planificación elegido da como resultado una explosión combinatoria con grandes conjuntos de solicitudes: en cualquier momento o un enfoque totalmente reactivo debe considerarse para problemas más complejos.

        "The satellites are equipped with a single observation instrument whose mirror can roll to shift the line of sight.",
        "A minimum duration is necessary to move the mirror, so requests that are too close together cannot be realized by the same satellite.",
        "The satellites are also equipped with a detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board.",
        "The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.",
        "A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar areas, and thus can communicate without the ground intervention.",
        "Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.",

        "Carrying out a request cannot prevent another agent from carrying out another one, even the same one.",
        "At most, there will be a waste of resources.",
        "Formally, a swarm is defined as follows: Definition 1 (Swarm).",

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

        "In the sequel, we call this conjunction a communication occurrence. 4.4.1 Convergence The structure of the transmitted information and the internal update mechanism (Protocol 2) allow the process to converge.",
        "Indeed, a request R can only be in two states (realized or not) given by the boolean bR.",
        "Once an internal update is made - i.e.",
        "R is realized - R cannot go back to its former state.",

        "Then it seems that livelocks2 would be likely to appear.",
        "However, a candidacy C is associated to a request and a realization date (the deadline given by obsC ).",
        "After the deadline, the candidacy becomes meaningless.",
        "Thus for each candidacy, there exists a date t ∈ T when changes will propagate no more. 4.4.2 Complexity It has been shown that in a set of N agents where a single one has a new piece of information, an epidemic protocol takes O(logN) steps to broadcast the information [33].",
        "During one step, each agent has a communication occurrence.",
        "As agents do not have much time to communicate, such a communication occurrence must not have a too big temporal complexity, which we can prove formally: Proposition 1.",

For agent si, the complexity of Protocol 1 is O(|Rt si | + |Rt si |.|S| | {z } emission + |Rt sj | + |Rt sj |.|S| | {z } reception ) For each received piece of information, agent si uses Protocol 3 and searches through its knowledge bases: |Rt si | pieces of information for each received request and |Rt si |.|S| pieces of 2 Communicating endlessly without converging. information for each received candidacy.",
        "Consequently, the complexity of Protocol 3 is O(|Rt sj |.|Rt si | + |Rt sj |.|Rt si |.|S|2 ) Thus, the temporal complexity of a communication occurrence is: O(|Rt si | + |Rt si |.|S| + |Rt sj |.|Rt si | + |Rt sj |.|Rt si |.|S|2 )) Then: O(|Rt si |.|Rt sj |.|S|2 ) 5.",
        "ON-BOARD PLANNING In space contexts, [5, 21, 6] present multi-agent architectures for on-board planning.",
        "However, they assume high communication and computation capabilities [10]. [13] relax these constraints by cleaving planning modules: on the first hand, satellites have a planner that builds plans on a large horizon and on the second hand, they have a decision module that enables them to choose to realize or not a planned observation.",
        "In an uncertain environment such as the one of satellite swarms, it may be advantageous to delay the decision until the last moment (i.e. the realization date), especially if there are several possibilities for a given request.",
        "The main idea in contingency planning [15, 29] is to determine the nodes in the initial plan where the risks of failures are most important and to incrementally build contingency branches for these situations. 5.1 A deliberative approach Inspired from both approaches, we propose to build allocations made up of a set of unquestionable requests and a set of uncertain disjunctive requests on which a decision will be made at the end of the decision horizon.",
        "This horizon corresponds to the request realization date.",

        "In the case of low mutual exclusion and conflict rate (Table 1), centralized and isolated simulations lead to the same number of observations, with the same average priorities.",

                "The satellites are also equipped with a detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board.",
                "The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.",
                "A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar areas, and thus can communicate without the ground intervention.",
                "Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.",
                "The features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 3.",
                "A MULTI-AGENT APPROACH As each satellite is a single entity that is a piece of the global swarm, a multi-agent system fits to model satellite constellations [39].",
                "This approach has been developped through the ObjectAgent architecture [38], TeamAgent [31], DIPS [14] or Prospecting ANTS [12]. 3.1 Satellite swarm An observation satellite swarm1 is a multi-agent system where the requests do not have to be carried out in a fixed order and the agents (the satellites) do not have any physical interaction.",

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

                "The satellites are also equipped with a detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board.",
                "The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.",
                "A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar areas, and thus can communicate without the ground intervention.",
                "Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.",
                "The features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 3.",

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R.

                "The satellites are also equipped with a detection instrument pointed forward that detects hot points and generates observation requests on-board.",
                "The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.",
                "A judicious positioning of the satellites in their orbits makes it possible to consider that two (or more) satellites meet in the polar areas, and thus can communicate without the ground intervention.",
                "Intuitively, intersatellite communication increases the reactivity of the constellation since each satellite is within direct view of a ground station (and thus can communicate with it) only 10 % of the time.",
                "The features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 3.",

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R. More formally: Definition 3 (Candidacy).",

                "The constellations that we consider are such as the orbits of the various satellites meet around the poles.",

                "The features of the problem are the following: - 3 to 20 satellites in the constellation; - pair communication around the poles; - no ground intervention during the planning process; - asynchronous requests with various priorities. 3.",
                "A MULTI-AGENT APPROACH As each satellite is a single entity that is a piece of the global swarm, a multi-agent system fits to model satellite constellations [39].",

For each request R in Rt si , there is a cost value, noted costsi (R) ∈ R, representing how far from the desired date of observation tbeg(R) an agent si can realize R. So, the more an agent can carry out a request in the vicinity of the desired date of observation, the lower the cost value. 3.3 Candidacy An agent may have several intentions about a request, i.e. for a request R, an agent si may: - propose to carry out R : si may realize R; - commit to carry out R : si will realize R; - not propose to carry out R : si may not realize R; - refuse to carry out R : si will not realize R. We can notice that these four propositions are modalities of proposition C: si realizes R: - 3C means that si proposes to carry out R; - 2C means that si commits to carry out R; - ¬3C means that si does not propose to carry out R; - ¬2C means that si refuses to carry out R. More formally: Definition 3 (Candidacy).",

                "Consequently, a redundancy is useful only if the other agent is more expert or if the priority of the request is high enough to need redundancy.",
                "Therefore, we will use the insurance strategy (refer to Section 6.2) and define a competitive strategy.",

                "In the case of low mutual exclusion and conflict rate (Table 1), centralized and isolated simulations lead to the same number of observations, with the same average priorities.",
                "Isolation leading to a lower cost is due to the high number of redundancies: many agents carry out the same request at different costs.",

                "We can notice that all informed simulations (with or without strategies) allow to perform more observations than isolated agents do with less redundancies.",

                "In the worst case, at each meeting each agent sends N pieces of information on the requests plus 3N pieces of information on the agents intentions plus 1 message for the end of communication, where N is the total number of requests.",

                "Some simulations have been made to experimentally validate these protocols and the first results are promising but raise many questions.",
