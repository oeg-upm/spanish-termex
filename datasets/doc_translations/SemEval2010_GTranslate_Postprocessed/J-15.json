Wellman University of Michigan, Computer Science & Engineering 2260 Hayward St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2121, USA {yagil,wellman}@umich.edu ABSTRACT Multiattribute auction mechanisms generally either remain agnostic about traders preferences, or presume highly restrictive forms, such as full additivity. Real preferences often exhibit dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify operation of a multiattribute auction. We develop such a structure using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility representation based on an underlying order over preference differences. A set of local conditional independence relations over such differences supports a generalized additive preference representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of related attributes. We introduce an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full space of joint configurations. When traders preferences are consistent with the auctions generalized additive structure, the mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations, at approximate VCG prices.

INTRODUCTION Multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional, price-only mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal. Rather than negotiating over a fully defined good or service, a multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified. For example, a procurement department of a company may use a multiattribute auction to select a supplier of hard drives. Supplier offers may be evaluated not only over the price they offer, but also over various qualitative attributes such as volume, RPM, access time, latency, transfer rate, and so on. In addition, suppliers may offer different contract conditions such as warranty, delivery time, and service. In order to account for traders preferences, the auction mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain of multidimensional configurations. Constructing and communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some simplified form. By far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt is the simplest: an additive representation where overall value is a linear combination of values associated with each attribute. For example, several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions [2, 3, 8, 19] require additive preference representations. Such additivity reduces the complexity of preference specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes. In practice, however, interdependencies among natural attributes are quite common. For example, the buyer may exhibit complementary preferences for size and access time (since the performance effect is more salient if much data is involved), or may view a strong warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings. Similarly, the sellers production characteristics (such as increasing access time is harder for larger hard drives) can easily violate additivity. In such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide even a reasonable approximation of real preferences. On the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some structure. Our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these properties of preferences in trading mechanisms. We propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a flexible preference structure. Our approach is inspired by the design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive preferences, due to Parkes and Kalagnanam (PK) [19]. PK propose two types of iterative auctions: the first (NLD) makes no assumptions about traders preferences, and lets sellers bid on the full multidimensional attribute space. Because NLD maintains an exponential price structure, it is suitable only for small domains. The other auction (AD) assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost functions. It collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single discount term. The price of a configuration is defined as the sum of the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount. The auction we propose also supports compact price spaces, albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons. We employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive independence (GAI), a model flexible enough to accommodate interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence can be limited. Given its roots in multiattribute utility theory [13], 227 the GAI condition is defined with respect to the expected utility function. To apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes, therefore, requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty. To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference. We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each. That is, we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference in price. Next, we build a direct, formally justified link from preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive decomposition of the wtp function. After laying out this infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to express their complex preferences in GAI format. We then study the auctions allocational, computational, and practical properties. In Section 2 we present essential background on our representation framework, the measurable value function (MVF). Section 3 develops new multiattribute structures for MVF, supporting generalized additive decompositions. Next, we show the applicability of the theoretical framework to preferences in trading. The rest of the paper is devoted to the proposed auction mechanism. 2. MULTIATTRIBUTE PREFERENCES As mentioned, most tools facilitating expression of multiattribute value for trading applications assume that agents preferences can be represented in an additive form. By way of background, we start by introducing the formal prerequisites justifying the additive representation, as provided by multiattribute utility theory. We then present the generalized additive form, and develop the formal underpinnings for measurable value needed to extend this model to the case of choice under certainty. 2.1 Preferential Independence Let Θ denote the space of possible outcomes, with a preference relation (weak total order) over Θ. Let A = {a0, . . . , am} be a set of attributes describing Θ. Capital letters denote subsets of variables, small letters (with or without numeric subscripts) denote specific variables, and ¯X denotes the complement of X with respect to A. We indicate specific variable assignments with prime signs or superscripts. To represent an instantiation of subsets X, Y at the same time we use a sequence of instantiation symbols, as in X Y . DEFINITION 1. A set of attributes Y ⊂ A is preferentially independent (PI) of its complement Z = A \\ Y if the conditional preference order over Y given a fixed level Z0 of Z is the same regardless of the choice of Z0 . In other words, the preference order over the projection of A on the attributes in Y is the same for any instantiation of the attributes in Z. DEFINITION 2. A = {a1, . . . , am} is mutually preferentially independent (MPI) if any subset of A is preferentially independent of its complement. The preference relation when no uncertainty is modeled is usually represented by a value function v [17]. The following fundamental result greatly simplifies the value function representation. THEOREM 1 ([9]). A preference order over set of attributes A has an additive value function representation v(a1, . . . , am) = mX i=1 vi(ai) iff A is mutually preferential independent. Essentially, the additive forms used in trading mechanisms assume mutual preferential independence over the full set of attributes, including the money attribute. Intuitively that means that willingness to pay for value of an attribute or attributes cannot be affected by the value of other attributes. A cardinal value function representing an ordering over certain outcomes need not in general coincide with the cardinal utility function that represents preference over lotteries or expected utility (EU). Nevertheless, EU functions may possess structural properties analogous to that for value functions, such as additive decomposition. Since the present work does not involve decisions under uncertainty, we do not provide a full exposition of the EU concept. However we do make frequent reference to the following additive independence relations. DEFINITION 3. Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes A. X and Y are conditionally additive independent given Z, denoted as CAI(X, Y | Z), if preferences over lotteries on A depend only on their marginal conditional probability distributions over X and Y . DEFINITION 4. Let I1, . . . , Ig ⊆ A such that Sg i=1 Ii = A. I1, . . . , Ig are called generalized additive independent (GAI) if preferences over lotteries on A depend only on their marginal distributions over I1, . . . , Ig. An (expected) utility function u(·) can be decomposed additively according to its (possibly overlapping) GAI sub-configurations. THEOREM 2 ([13]). Let I1, . . . , Ig be GAI. Then there exist functions f1, . . . , fg such that u(a1, . . . , am) = g X r=1 fr(Ir). (1) What is now known as the GAI condition was originally introduced by Fishburn [13] for EU, and was named GAI and brought to the attention of AI researchers by Bacchus and Grove [1]. Graphical models and elicitation procedures for GAI decomposable utility were developed for EU [4, 14, 6], for a cardinal representation of the ordinal value function [15], and for an ordinal preference relations corresponding to a TCP-net structure by Brafman et al. [5]. Apart from the work on GAI in the context of preference handling that were discussed above, GAI have been recently used in the context of mechanism design by Hyafil and Boutilier [16], as an aid in direct revelation mechanisms. As shown by Bacchus and Grove [1], GAI structure can be identified based on a set of CAI conditions, which are much easier to detect and verify. In general, utility functions may exhibit GAI structure not based on CAI. However, to date all proposals for reasoning and eliciting utility in GAI form take advantage of the GAI structure primarily to the extent that it represents a collection of CAI conditions. For example, GAI trees [14] employ triangulation of the CAI map, and Braziunas and Boutiliers [6] conditional set Cj of a set Ij corresponds to the CAI separating set of Ij. Since the CAI condition is also defined based on preferences over lotteries, we cannot apply Bacchus and Groves result without first establishing an alternative framework based on priced outcomes. We develop such a framework using the theory of measurable value functions, ultimately producing a GAI decomposition 228 (Eq. 1) of the wtp function. Readers interested primarily in the multiattribute auction and willing to grant the well-foundedness of the preference structure may skip down to Section 5. 2.2 Measurable Value Functions Trading decisions represent a special case of decisions under certainty, where choices involve multiattribute outcomes and corresponding monetary payments. In such problems, the key decision often hinges on relative valuations of price differences compared to differences in alternative configurations of goods and services. Theoretically, price can be treated as just another attribute, however, such an approach fails to exploit the special character of the money dimension, and can significantly add to complexity due to the inherent continuity and typical wide range of possible monetary outcome values. We build on the fundamental work of Dyer and Sarin [10, 11] on measurable value functions (MVFs). As we show below, wtp functions in a quasi-linear setting can be interpreted as MVFs. However we first present the MVF framework in a more generic way, where the measurement is not necessarily monetary. We present the essential definitions and refer to Dyer and Sarin for more detailed background and axiomatic treatment. The key concept is that of preference difference. Let θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ Θ such that θ1 θ2 and ϑ1 ϑ2 . [θ2 , θ1 ] denotes the preference difference between θ2 and θ1 , interpreted as the strength, or degree, to which θ2 is preferred over θ1 . Let ∗ denote a preference order over Θ × Θ. We interpret the statement [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] as the preference of ϑ2 over ϑ1 is at least as strong as the preference of θ2 over θ1 . We use the symbol ∼∗ to represent equality of preference differences. DEFINITION 5. u : D → is a measurable value function (MVF) wrt ∗ if for any θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ D, [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] ⇔ u(θ2 ) − u(θ1 ) ≤ u(ϑ2 ) − u(ϑ1 ). Note that an MVF can also be used as a value function representing , since [θ , θ] ∗ [θ , θ] iff θ θ . DEFINITION 6 ([11]). Attribute set X ⊂ A is called difference independent of ¯X if for any two assignments X1 ¯X X2 ¯X , [X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ] ∼∗ [X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ] for any assignment ¯X . Or, in words, the preference differences on assignments to X given a fixed level of ¯X do not depend on the particular level chosen for ¯X. As with additive independence for EU, this condition is stronger than preferential independence of X. Also analogously to EU, mutual preferential independence combined with other conditions leads to additive decomposition of the MVF. Moreover, Dyer and Sarin [11] have defined analogs of utility independence [17] for MVF, and worked out a parallel set of decomposition results. 3. ADVANCED MVF STRUCTURES 3.1 Conditional Difference Independence Our first step is to generalize Definition 6 to a conditional version. DEFINITION 7. Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes A. X is conditionally difference independent of Y given Z, denoted as CDI(X, Y | Z), if ∀ instantiations ˆZ, X1 , X2 , Y 1 , Y 2 [X1 Y 1 ˆZ, X2 Y 1 ˆZ] ∼ [X1 Y 2 ˆZ, X2 Y 2 ˆZ]. Since the conditional set is always the complement, we sometimes leave it implicit, using the abbreviated notation CDI(X, Y ). CDI leads to a decomposition similar to that obtained from CAI [17]. LEMMA 3. Let u(A) be an MVF representing preference differences. Then CDI(X, Y | Z) iff u(A) = u(X0 , Y, Z) + u(X, Y 0 , Z) − u(X0 , Y 0 , Z). To complete the analogy with CAI, we generalize Lemma 3 as follows. PROPOSITION 4. CDI(X, Y | Z) iff there exist functions ψ1(X, Z) and ψ2(Y, Z), such that u(X, Y, Z) = ψ1(X, Z) + ψ2(Y, Z). (2) An immediate result of Proposition 4 is that CDI is a symmetric relation. The conditional independence condition is much more applicable than the unconditional one. For example, if attributes a ∈ X and b /∈ X are complements or substitutes, X cannot be difference independent of ¯X. However, X \\ {a} may still be CDI of ¯X given a. 3.2 GAI Structure for MVF A single CDI condition decomposes the value function into two parts. We seek a finer-grain global decomposition of the utility function, similar to that obtained from mutual preferential independence. For this purpose we are now ready to employ the results of Bacchus and Grove [1], who establish that the CAI condition has a perfect map [20]; that is, there exists a graph whose nodes correspond to the set A, and its node separation reflects exactly the complete set of CAI conditions on A. Moreover, they show that the utility function decomposes over the set of maximal cliques of the perfect map. Their proofs can be easily adapted to CDI, since they only rely on the decomposition property of CAI that is also implied by CDI according to Proposition 4. THEOREM 5. Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI conditions on A. Then u(A) = g X r=1 fr(Ir), (3) where I1, . . . , Ig are (overlapping) subsets of A, each corresponding to a maximal clique of G. Given Theorem 5, we can now identify an MVF GAI structure from a collection of CDI conditions. The CDI conditions, in turn, are particularly intuitive to detect when the preference differences carry a direct interpretation, as in the case with monetary differences discussed below. Moreover, the assumption or detection of CDI conditions can be performed incrementally, until the MVF is decomposed to a reasonable dimension. This is in contrast with the fully additive decomposition of MVF that requires mutual preferential independence [11]. Theorem 5 defines a decomposition structure, but to represent the actual MVF we need to specify the functions over the cliques. 229 The next theorem establishes that the functional constituents of MVF are the same as those for GAI decompositions as defined by Fishburn [13] for EU. We adopt the following conventional notation. Let (a0 1, . . . , a0 m) be a predefined vector called the reference outcome. For any I ⊆ A, the function u([I]) stands for the projection of u(A) to I where the rest of the attributes are fixed at their reference levels. THEOREM 6. Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI condition on A, and {I1, . . . , Ig} a set of maximal cliques as defined in Theorem 5. Then the functional decomposition from that theorem can be defined as f1 = u([I1]), and for r = 2, . . . , g (4) fr = u([Ir]) + r−1X k=1 (−1)k X 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\\ s=1 Iis ∩ Ir]) The proof directly shows that if graph G = (A, E) is a perfect map of CDI, u(A) decomposes to a sum over the functions defined in (4).1 Thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result of Theorem 5, only on the existence of the perfect map. To summarize, the results of this section generalize additive MVF theory. In particular it justifies the application of methods recently developed under the EU framework [1, 4, 14, 6] to representation of value under certainty. 4. WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY AS AN MVF 4.1 Construction In this section we apply measurable value to represent differences of willingness to pay for outcomes. We assume that the agent has a preference order over outcome space, represented by a set of attributes A, and an attribute p representing monetary consequence. Note that in evaluating a purchase decision, p would correspond to the agents money holdings net of the transaction (i.e., wealth after purchase), not the purchase price. An outcome in this space is represented for example by (θ , p ), where θ is an instantiation of A and p is a value of p. We further assume that preferences are quasi-linear in p, that is there exists a value function of the form v(A, p) = u(A) + L(p), where L is a positive linear function.2 The quasi-linear form immediately qualifies money as a measure of preference differences, and establishes a monetary scale for u(A). DEFINITION 8. Let v(A, p) = u(A)+L(p) represent , where p is the attribute representing money. We call u(A) a willingnessto-pay (wtp) function. Note that wtp may also refer to the sellers willingness to accept function. The wtp u(A) is a cardinal function, unique up to a positive linear transformation. Since (θ1, p ) (θ2, p ) ⇔ u(θ1) − u(θ2) ≤ L(p − p ), (where θ1, θ1 ∈ Θ, the domain of A) the wtp function can be used to choose among priced outcomes. 1 This proof and most other proofs in this paper are omitted for space consideration, and are available in an online appendix. 2 In many procurement applications, the deals in question are small relative to the enterprises involved, so the quasi-linearity assumption is warranted. This assumption can be relaxed to a condition called corresponding tradeoffs [17], which does not require the value over money to be linear. To simplify the presentation, however, we maintain the stronger assumption. Naturally, elicitation of wtp function is most intuitive when using direct monetary values. In other words, we elicit a function in which L(p) = p, so v(A, p) = u(A) + p. We define a reference outcome (θ0 , p0 ), and assuming continuity of p, for any assignment ˆθ there exists a ˆp such that (ˆθ, ˆp) ∼ (θ0 , p0 ). As v is normalized such that v(θ0 , p0 ) = 0, ˆp is interpreted as the wtp for ˆθ, or the reserve price of ˆθ. PROPOSITION 7. The wtp function is an MVF over differences in the reserve prices. We note that the wtp function is used extensively in economics, and that all the development in Section 3 could be performed directly in terms of wtp, relying on quasi-linearity for preference measurement, and without formalization using MVFs. This formalization however aligns this work with the fundamental difference independence theory by Dyer and Sarin. In addition to facilitating the detection of GAI structure, the CDI condition supports elicitation using local queries, similar to how CAI is used by Braziunas and Boutilier [6]. We adopt their definition of conditional set of Ir, noted here Sr, as the set of neighbors of attributes in Ir not including the attributes of Ir. Clearly, Sr is the separating set of Ir in the CDI map, hence CDI(Ir, Vr), where Vr = A \\ (Ir ∪ Sr). From the definition of CDI, for any V 1 r , V 2 r we have: u(I1 r S0 r V 1 r ) − u(I2 r S0 r V 1 r ) = u(I1 r S0 r V 2 r ) − u(I2 r S0 r V 2 r ). Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the utility (wtp) of one full outcome (the reference outcome θ0 ), and then obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary differences between its possible assignments (technique known as pricing out [17]), keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed. These ceteris paribus elicitation queries are local in the sense that the agent does not need to consider the values of the rest of the attributes. Furthermore, in eliciting MVFs we can avoid the global scaling step that is required for EU functions. Since the preference differences are extracted with respect to specific amounts of the attribute p, the utility is already scaled according to that external measure. Hence, once the conditional utility functions u([Ij]) are obtained, we can calculate u(A) according to (4). This last step may require (in the worst case) computation of a number of terms that is exponential in the number of max cliques. In practice however we do not expect the intersection of the cliques to go that deep; intersection of more than just a few max cliques would normally be empty. To take advantage of that we can use the search algorithm suggested by Braziunas and Boutilier [6], which efficiently finds all the nonempty intersections for each clique. 4.2 Optimization As shown, the wtp function can be used directly for pairwise comparisons of priced outcomes. Another preference query often treated in the literature is optimization, or choice of best outcome, possibly under constraints. Typical decisions about exchange of a good or service exhibit what we call first-order preferential independence (FOPI), under which most or all single attributes have a natural ordering of quality, independent of the values of the rest.3 For example, when choosing a PC we always prefer more memory, faster CPU, longer warranty, and so on. Under FOPI, the unconstrained optimization of 3 This should not be mistaken with the highly demanding condition of mutual preferential independence, that requires all tradeoffs between attributes to be independent. 230 unpriced outcomes is trivial, hence we consider choice among attribute points with prices. Since any outcome can be best given enough monetary compensation, this problem is not well-defined unless the combinations are constrained somehow. A particularly interesting optimization problem arises in the context of negotiation, where we consider the utility of both buyers and sellers. The multiattribute matching problem (MMP) [12] is concerned with finding an attribute point that maximizes the surplus of a trade, or the difference between the utilities of the buyer and the seller, ub(A) − us(A). GAI, as an additive decomposition, has the property that if ub and us are in GAI form then ub(A)−us(A) is in GAI form as well. We can therefore use combinatorial optimization procedures for GAI decomposition, based on the well studied variable elimination schemes (e.g., [15]) to find the best trading point. Similarly, this optimization can be done to maximize surplus between a traders utility function and a pricing system that assigns a price to each level of each GAI element, and this way guide traders to their optimal bidding points. In the rest of the paper we develop a multiattribute procurement auction that builds on this idea. 5. GAI IN MULTIATTRIBUTE AUCTIONS 5.1 The Multiattribute Procurement Problem In the procurement setting a single buyer wishes to procure a single good, in some configuration θ ∈ Θ from one of the candidate sellers s1, . . . , sn. The buyer has some private valuation function (wtp) ub : Θ → R, and similarly each seller si has a private valuation function (willingness-to-accept). For compliance with the procurement literature we refer to seller sis valuation as a cost function, denoted by ci. The multiattribute allocation problem (MAP) [19] is the welfare optimization problem in procurement over a discrete domain, and it is defined as: i∗ , θ∗ = arg max i,θ (ub(θ) − ci(θ)). (5) To illustrate the need for a GAI price space we consider the case of traders with non-additive preferences bidding in an additive price space such as in PKs auction AD. If the buyers preferences are not additive, choosing preferred levels per attribute (as in auction AD) admits undesired combinations and fails to guide the sellers to the efficient configurations. Non-additive sellers face an exposure problem, somewhat analogous to traders with complementary preferences that participate in simultaneous auctions. A value a1 for attribute a may be optimal given that the value of another attribute b is b1 , and arbitrarily suboptimal given other values of b. Therefore bidding a1 and b1 may result in a poor allocation if the seller is outbid on b1 but left holding a1 .4 Instead of assuming full additivity, the auction designer can come up with a GAI preference structure that captures the set of common interdependencies between attributes. If traders could bid on clusters of interdependent attributes, it would solve the problems discussed above. For example, if a and b are interdependent (meaning CDI(a, b) does not hold), we should be able to bid on the cluster ab. If b in turn depends on c, we need another cluster bc. This is still better than a general pricing structure that solicits bids for the cluster abc. We stress that each trader may have a different set of interdependencies, and therefore to be completely general the 4 If only the sellers are non-additive, the auction design could potentially alleviate this problem by collecting a new set of bids each round and forgetting bids from previous rounds, and also guiding non-additive sellers to bid on only one level per attribute in order to avoid undesired combinations. ya yb \u001a \u001a \u001a yc Z Z Z (i) \u0011 \u0010 ¨ ©a, b \u0011 \u0010 ¨ ©b, c (ii) Figure 1: (i) CDI map for {a, b, c}, reflecting the single condition CDI(a, c). (ii) The corresponding GAI network. GAI structure needs to account for all.5 However, in practice many domains have natural dependencies that are mutual to traders. 5.2 GAI Trees Assume that preferences of all traders are reflected in a GAI structure I1, . . . , Ig. We call each Ir a GAI element, and any assignment to Ir a sub-configuration. We use θr to denote the subconfiguration formed by projecting configuration θ to element Ir. DEFINITION 9. Let α be an assignment to Ir and β an assignment to Ir . The sub-configurations α and β are consistent if for any attribute aj ∈ Ir ∩ Ir , α and β agree on the value of aj. A collection ν of sub-configurations is consistent if all pairs α, β ∈ ν are consistent. The collection is called a cover if it contains exactly one sub-configuration αr corresponding to each element Ir, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}. Note that a consistent cover {α1, . . . , αg} represents a full configuration, which we denote by (α1, . . . , αg). A GAI network is a graph G whose nodes correspond to the GAI elements I1, . . . , Ig, with an edge between Ir, Ir iff Ir ∩ Ir = ∅. Equivalently, a GAI network is the clique graph of a CDI-map. In order to justify the compact pricing structure we require that for any set of optimal configurations (wrt a given utility function), with a corresponding collection of sub-configurations γ, all consistent covers in γ must be optimal configurations as well. To ensure this (see Lemmas 8 and 10), we assume a GAI decomposition in the form of a tree or a forest (the GAI tree). A tree structure can be achieved for any set of CDI conditions by triangulation of the CDI-map prior to construction of the clique graph (GAI networks and GAI trees are defined by Gonzales and Perny [14], who also provide a triangulation algorithm). Under GAI, the buyers value function ub and sellers cost functions ci can be decomposed as in (1). We use fb,r and fi,r to denote the local functions of buyer and sellers (respectively), according to (4). For example, consider the procurement of a good with three attributes, a, b, c. Each attributes domain has two values (e.g., {a1 , a2 } is the domain of A). Let the GAI structure be I1 = {a, b}, I2 = {b, c}. Figure 1 shows the simple CDI map and the corresponding GAI network, which is a GAI tree. Here, subconfigurations are assignments of the form a1 b1 , a1 b2 , b1 c1 , and so on. The set of sub-configurations {a1 b1 , b1 c1 } is a consistent cover, corresponding to the configuration a1 b1 c1 . In contrast, the set {a1 b1 , b2 c1 } is inconsistent. 5.3 The GAI Auction We define an iterative multiattribute auction that maintains a GAI pricing structure: that is, a price pt (·) corresponding to each subconfiguration of each GAI-tree element. The price of a configuration θ at time t is defined as pt (θ) = g X r=1 pt (θr) − Δ. 5 We relax this requirement in Section 6. 231 Bidders submit sub-bids on sub-configurations and on an additional global discount term Δ.6 Sub-bids are always submitted for current prices, and need to be resubmitted at each round, therefore they do not need to explicitly carry the price. The set of full bids of a seller contains all consistent covers that can be generated from that sellers current set of sub-bids. The existence of a full bid over a configuration θ represents the sellers willingness to accept the price pt (θ) for supplying θ. At the start of the auction, the buyer reports (to the auction, not to sellers) her complete valuation in GAI form. The initial prices of sub-configurations are set at some level above the buyers valuations, that is, p1 (θr) > fb,r(θr) for all θr. The discount Δ is initialized to zero. The auction has the dynamics of a descending clock auction: at each round t, bids are collected for current prices and then prices are reduced according to price rules. A seller is considered active in a round if she submits at least one full bid. In round t > 1, only sellers who where active in round t − 1 are allowed to participate, and the auction terminates when no more than a single seller is active. We denote the set of sub-bids submitted by si by Bt i , and the corresponding set of full bids is Bt i = {θ = (θ1, . . . , θg) ∈ Θ | ∀r.θr ∈ Bt i }. In our example, a seller could submit sub-bids on a set of subconfigurations such as a1 b1 and b1 c1 , and that combines to a full bid on a1 b1 c1 . The auction proceeds in two phases. In the first phase (A), at each round t the auction computes a set of preferred sub-configurations Mt . Section 5.4 shows how to define Mt to ensure convergence, and Section 5.5 shows how to efficiently compute it. In phase A, the auction adjusts prices after each round, reducing the price of every sub-configuration that has received a bid but is not in the preferred set. Let be the prespecified price increment parameter. Specifically, the phase A price change rule is applied to all θr ∈ Sn i=1 Bt i \\ Mt : pt+1 (θr) ← max(pt (θr) − g , fb,r(θr)). [A] The RHS maximum ensures that prices do not get reduced below the buyers valuation in phase A. Let Mt denote the set of configurations that are consistent covers in Mt : Mt = {θ = (θ1, . . . , θg) ∈ Θ | ∀r.θr ∈ Mt } The auction switches to phase B when all active sellers have at least one full bid in the buyers preferred set: ∀i. Bt i = ∅ ∨ Bt i ∩ Mt = ∅. [SWITCH] Let T be the round at which [SWITCH] becomes true. At this point, the auction selects the buyer-optimal full bid ηi for each seller si. ηi = arg max θ∈BT i (ub(θ) − pT (θ)). (6) In phase B, si may bid only on ηi. The prices of sub-configurations are fixed at pT (·) during this phase. The only adjustment in phase B is to Δ, which is increased in every round by . The auction terminates when at most one seller (if exactly one, designate it sˆi) is active. There are four distinct cases: 1. All sellers drop out in phase A (i.e., before rule [SWITCH] holds). The auction returns with no allocation. 6 The discount term could be replaced with a uniform price reduction across all sub-configurations. 2. All active sellers drop out in the same round in phase B. The auction selects the best seller (sˆi) from the preceding round, and applies the applicable case below. 3. The auction terminates in phase B with a final price above buyers valuation, pT (ηˆi) − Δ > ub(ηˆi). The auction offers the winner sˆi an opportunity to supply ηˆi at price ub(ηˆi). 4. The auction terminates in phase B with a final price pT (ηˆi)− Δ ≤ ub(ηˆi). This is the ideal situation, where the auction allocates the chosen configuration and seller at this resulting price. The overall auction is described by high-level pseudocode in Algorithm 1. As explained in Section 5.4, the role of phase A is to guide the traders to their efficient configurations. Phase B is a one-dimensional competition over the surplus that remaining seller candidates can provide to the buyer. In Section 5.5 we discuss the computational tasks associated with the auction, and Section 5.6 provides a detailed example. Algorithm 1 GAI-based multiattribute auction collect a reported valuation, ˆv from the buyer set high initial prices, p1 (θr) on each level θr, and set Δ = 0 while not [SWITCH] do collect sub-bids from sellers compute Mt apply price change by [A] end while compute ηi while more than one active seller do increase Δ by collect bids on (ηi, Δ) from sellers end while implement allocation and payment to winning seller 5.4 Economic Analysis When the optimal solution to MAP (5) provides negative welfare and sellers do not bid below their cost, the auction terminates in phase A, no trade occurs and the auction is trivially efficient. We therefore assume throughout the analysis that the optimal (seller,configuration) pair provides non-negative welfare. The buyer profit from a configuration θ is defined as7 πb(θ) = ub(θ) − p(θ) and similarly πi(θ) = p(θ) − ci(θ) is the profit of si. In addition, for μ ⊆ {1, . . . , g} we denote the corresponding set of subconfigurations by θμ, and define the profit from a configuration θ over the subset μ as πb(θμ) = X r∈μ (fb,r(θr) − p(θr)). πi(θμ) is defined similarly for si. Crucially, for any μ and its complement ¯μ and for any trader τ, πτ (θ) = πτ (θμ) + πτ (θ¯μ). The function σi : Θ → R represents the welfare, or surplus function ub(·) − ci(·). For any price system p, σi(θ) = πb(θ) + πi(θ). 7 We drop the t superscript in generic statements involving price and profit functions, understanding that all usage is with respect to the (currently) applicable prices. 232 Since we do not assume anything about the buyers strategy, the analysis refers to profit and surplus with respect to the face value of the buyers report. The functions πi and σi refer to the true cost functions of si. DEFINITION 10. A seller is called Straightforward Bidder (SB) if at each round t she bids on Bt i as follows: if maxθ∈Θ πt i (θ) < 0, then Bt i = ∅. Otherwise let Ωt i ⊆ arg max θ∈Θ πt i (θ) Bt i = {θr | θ ∈ Ωt i, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}}. Intuitively, an SB seller follows a myopic best response strategy (MBR), meaning they bid myopically rather than strategically by optimizing their profit with respect to current prices. To calculate Bt i sellers need to optimize their current profit function, as discussed in Section 4.2. The following lemma bridges the apparent gap between the compact pricing and bid structure and the global optimization performed by the traders. LEMMA 8. Let Ψ be a set of configurations, all maximizing profit for a trader τ (seller or buyer) at the relevant prices. Let Φ = {θr | θ ∈ Ψ, r ∈ {1, . . . , g}. Then any consistent cover in Φ is also a profit-maximizing configuration for τ. Proof sketch (full proof in the online appendix): A source of an element θr is a configuration ˜θ ∈ Ψ from which it originated (meaning, ˜θr = θr). Starting from the supposedly suboptimal cover θ1 , we build a series of covers θ1 , . . . , θL . At each θj we flip the value of a set of sub-configurations μj corresponding to a subtree, with the sub-configurations of the configuration ˆθj ∈ Ψ which is the source of the parent γj of μj . That ensures that all elements in μj ∪ {γj} have a mutual source ˆθj . We show that all θj are consistent and that they must all be suboptimal as well, and since all elements of θL have a mutual source, meaning θL = ˆθL ∈ Ψ, it contradicts optimality of Ψ. COROLLARY 9. For SB seller si, ∀t, ∀θ ∈ Bt i , πt i (θ ) = max θ∈Θ πt i (θ). Next we consider combinations of configurations that are only within some δ of optimality. LEMMA 10. Let Ψ be a set of configurations, all are within δ of maximizing profit for a trader τ at the prices, and Φ defined as in Lemma 8. Then any consistent cover in Φ is within δg of maximizing utility for τ. This bound is tight, that is for any GAI tree and a non-trivial domain we can construct a set Ψ as above in which there exists a consistent cover whose utility is exactly δg below the maximal. Next we formally define Mt . For connected GAI trees, Mt is the set of sub-configurations that are part of a configuration within of optimal. When the GAI tree is in fact a forest, we apportion the error proportionally across the disconnected trees. Let G be comprised of trees G1, . . . , Gh. We use θj to denote the projection of a configuration θ on the tree Gj , and gj denotes the number of GAI elements in Gj . Mt j = {θr | πt b(θj) ≥ max θj ∈Θj πt b(θj ) − gj g , r ∈ Gj } Then define Mt = Sh j=1 Mt j. Let ej = gj −1 denote the number of edges in Gj . We define the connectivity parameter, e = maxj=1,...,h ej . As shown below, this connectivity parameter is an important factor in the performance of the auction. COROLLARY 11. ∀θ ∈ Mt , πt b(θ ) ≥ max θ∈Θ πt b(θ) − (e + 1) In the fully additive case this loss of efficiency reduces to . On the other extreme, if the GAI network is connected then e+1 = g. We also note that without assuming any preference structure, meaning that the CDI map is fully connected, g = 1 and the efficiency loss is again . Lemmas 12 through 15 show that through the price system, the choice of buyer preferred configurations, and price change rules, Phase A leads the buyer and each of the sellers to their mutually efficient configuration. LEMMA 12. maxθ∈Θ πt b(θ) does not change in any round t of phase A. PROOF. We prove the lemma per each tree Gj. The optimal values for disconnected components are independent of each other hence if the maximal profit for each component does not change the combined maximal profit does not change as well. If the price of θj was reduced during phase A, that is pt+1 (θj) = pt (θj ) − δ, it must be the case that some w ≤ gj sub-configurations of θj are not in Mt j, and δ = w g . The definition of Mt j ensures πt b(θj ) < max θ∈Θ πt b(θj) − gj g . Therefore, πt+1 b (θ ) = πt (θ ) + δ = πt (θ ) + w g ≤ max θ∈Θ πt b(θj). This is true for any configuration whose profit improves, therefore the maximal buyer profit does not change during phase A. LEMMA 13. The price of at least one sub-configuration must be reduced at every round in phase A. PROOF. In each round t < T of phase A there exists an active seller i for whom Bt i ∩ Mt = ∅. However to be active in round t, Bt i = ∅. Let ˆθ ∈ Bt i . If ∀r.ˆθr ∈ Mt , then ˆθ ∈ Mt by definition of Mt . Therefore there must be ˆθr ∈ Mt . We need to prove that for at least one of these sub-configurations, πt b(ˆθr) < 0 to ensure activation of rule [A]. Assume for contradiction that for any ˆθr ∈ ¯Mt , πt b(ˆθr) ≥ 0. For simplicity we assume that for any θr, π1 b (θr) is some product of g (that can be easily done), and that ensures that πt b(ˆθr) = 0 because once profit hits 0 it cannot increase by rule [A]. If ˆθr ∈ ¯Mt , ∀r = 1, . . . , g then πt b(ˆθ) = 0. This contradicts Lemma 12 since we set high initial prices. Therefore some of the sub-configurations of ˆθ are in Mt , and WLOG we assume it is ˆθ1, . . . , ˆθk. To be in Mt these k sub-configurations must have been in some preferred full configuration, meaning there exists θ ∈ Mt such that θ = (ˆθ1, . . . , ˆθk, θk+1, . . . , θg) Since ˆθ /∈ Mt It must be that case that πt b(ˆθ) < πt b(θ ). Therefore πt b(θk+1, . . . , θg) > πt b(ˆθk+1, . . . , ˆθg) = 0 Hence for at least one r ∈ {k + 1, . . . , g}, πt b(θr) > 0 contradicting rule [A]. 233 LEMMA 14. When the solution to MAP provides positive surplus, and at least the best seller is SB, the auction must reach phase B. PROOF. By Lemma 13 prices must go down in every round of phase A. Rule [A] sets a lower bound on all prices therefore the auction either terminates in phase A or must reach condition [SWITCH]. We set the initial prices are high such that maxθ∈Θ π1 b (θ) < 0, and by Lemma 12 maxθ∈Θ πt b(θ) < 0 during phase A. We assume that the efficient allocation (θ∗ , i∗ ) provides positive welfare, that is σi∗ (θ∗ ) = πt b(θ∗ ) + πt i∗ (θ∗ ) > 0. si∗ is SB therefore she will leave the auction only when πt i∗ (θ∗ ) < 0. This can happen only when πt b(θ∗ ) > 0, therefore si∗ does not drop in phase A hence the auction cannot terminate before reaching condition [SWITCH]. LEMMA 15. For SB seller si, ηi is (e + 1) -efficient. PROOF. ηi is chosen to maximize the buyers surplus out of Bt i at the end of phase A. Since Bt i ∩ Mt = ∅, clearly ηi ∈ Mt . From Corollary 11 and Corollary 9, for any ˜θ, πT b (ηi) ≥ πT b (˜θ) − (e + 1) πT i (ηi) ≥ πT i (˜θ) ⇒ σi(ηi) ≥ σi(˜θ) − (e + 1) This establishes the approximate bilateral efficiency of the results of Phase A (at this point under the assumption of SB). Based on Phase Bs simple role as a single-dimensional bidding competition over the discount, we next assert that the overall result is efficient under SB, which in turn proves to be an approximately ex-post equilibrium strategy in the two phases. LEMMA 16. If sellers si and sj are SB, and si is active at least as long as sj is active in phase B, then σi(ηi) ≥ max θ∈Θ σj(θ) − (e + 2) . THEOREM 17. Given a truthful buyer and SB sellers, the auction is (e+2) -efficient: the surplus of the final allocation is within (e + 2) of the maximal surplus. Following PK, we rely on an equivalence to the one-sided VCG auction to establish incentive properties for the sellers. In the onesided multiattribute VCG auction, buyer and sellers report valuation and cost functions ˆub, ˆci, and the buyer pays the sell-side VCG payment to the winning seller. DEFINITION 11. Let (θ∗ , i∗ ) be the optimal solution to MAP. Let (˜θ,˜i) be the best solution to MAP when i∗ does not participate. The sell-side VCG payment is V CG(ˆub, ˆci) = ˆub(θ∗ ) − (ˆub(˜θ) − ˆc˜i(˜θ)). It is well-known that truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for sellers in the one-sided VCG auction. It is also shown by PK that the maximal regret for buyers from bidding truthfully in this mechanism is ub(θ∗ ) − ci∗ (θ∗ ) − (ub(˜θ) − ˆc˜i(˜θ)), that is, the marginal product of the efficient seller. Usually in iterative auctions the VCG outcome is only nearly achieved, but the deviation is bounded by the minimal price change. We show a similar result, and therefore define δ-VCG payments. DEFINITION 12. Sell-side δ-VCG payment for MAP is a payment p such that V CG(ˆub, ˆci) − δ ≤ p ≤ V CG(ˆub, ˆci) + δ. When payment is guaranteed to be δ-VCG sellers can only affect their payment within that range, therefore their gain by falsely reporting their cost is bounded by 2δ. LEMMA 18. When sellers are SB, the payment in the end of GAI auction is sell-side (e + 2) -VCG. THEOREM 19. SB is an (3e + 5) ex-post Nash Equilibrium for sellers in GAI auction. That is, sellers cannot gain more than (3e + 5) by deviating. In practice, however, sellers are unlikely to have the information that would let them exploit that potential gain. They are much more likely to lose from bidding on their less attractive configurations. 5.5 Computation and Complexity The size of the price space maintained in the auction is equal to the total number of sub-configurations, meaning it is exponential in maxr |Ir|. This is also equivalent to the tree-width (plus one) of the original CDI-map. For the purpose of the computational analysis let dj denote the domain of attribute aj, and I = Sg r=1 Q j∈Ir dj, the collection of all sub-configurations. The first purpose of this sub-section is to show that the complexity of all the computations required for the auction depends only on |I|, i.e., no computation depends on the size of the full exponential domain. We are first concerned with the computation of Mt . Since Mt grows monotonically with t, a naive application of optimization algorithm to generate the best outcomes sequentially might end up enumerating significant portions of the fully exponential domain. However as shown below this plain enumeration can be avoided. PROPOSITION 20. The computation of Mt can be done in time O(|I|2 ). Moreover, the total time spent on this task throughout the auction is O(|I|(|I| + T)). The bounds are in practice significantly lower, based on results on similar problems from the probabilistic reasoning literature [18]. One of the benefits of the compact pricing structure is the compact representation it lends for bids: sellers submit only sub-bids, and therefore the number of them submitted and stored per seller is bounded by |I|. Since the computation tasks: Bt i = ∅, rule [SWITCH] and choice of ηi are all involving the set Bt i , it is important to note that their performance only depend on the size of the set Bt i , since they are all subsumed by the combinatorial optimization task over Bt i or Bt i ∩ Mt . Next, we analyze the number of rounds it takes for the auction to terminate. Phase B requires maxi=1,...n πT i (ηi)1 . Since this is equivalent to price-only auctions, the concern is only with the time complexity of phase A. Since prices cannot go below fb,r(θr), an upper bound on the number of rounds required is T ≤ X θr∈I (p1 (θr) − fb,r(θr)) g However phase A may converge faster. Let the initial negative profit chosen by the auctioneer be m = maxθ∈Θ π1 b (θ). In the worst case phase A needs to run until ∀θ ∈ Θ.πb(θ) = m. This happens for example when ∀θr ∈ I.pt (θr) = fb,r(θr) + m g . In general, the closer the initial prices reflect buyer valuation, the faster phase A converges. One extreme is to choose p1 (θr) = 234 I1 I2 a1 b1 a2 b1 a1 b2 a2 b2 b1 c1 b2 c1 b1 c2 b2 c2 fb 65 50 55 70 50 85 60 75 f1 35 20 30 70 65 65 70 61 f2 35 20 25 25 55 110 70 95 Table 1: GAI utility functions for the example domain. fb represents the buyers valuation, and f1 and f2 costs of the sellers s1 and s2. fb,r(θr) + m g . That would make phase A redundant, at the cost of full initial revelation of buyers valuation as done in other mechanisms discussed below. Between this option and the other extreme, which is ∀α, ˆα ∈ I, p1 (α) = p1 (ˆα) the auctioneer has a range of choices to determine the right tradeoff between convergence time and information revelation. In the example below the choice of a lower initial price for the domain of I1 provides some speedup by revealing a harmless amount of information. Another potential concern is the communication cost associated with the Japanese auction style. The sellers need to send their bids over and over again at each round. A simple change can be made to avoid much of the redundant communication: the auction can retain sub-bids from previous rounds on sub-configurations whose price did not change. Since combinations of sub-bids from different rounds can yield sub-optimal configurations, each sub-bid should be tagged with the number of the latest round in which it was submitted, and only consistent combinations from the same round are considered to be full bids. With this implementation sellers need not resubmit their bid until a price of at least one sub-configuration has changed. 5.6 Example We use the example settings introduced in Section 5.2. Recall that the GAI structure is I1 = {a, b}, I2 = {b, c} (note that e = 1). Table 1 shows the GAI utilities for the buyer and the two sellers s1, s2. The efficient allocation is (s1, a1 b2 c1 ) with a surplus of 45. The maximal surplus of the second best seller, s2, is 25, achieved by a1 b1 c1 , a2 b1 c1 , and a2 b2 c2 . We set all initial prices over I1 to 75, and all initial prices over I2 to 90. We set = 8, meaning that price reduction for sub-configurations is 4. Though with these numbers it is not guaranteed by Theorem 17, we expect s1 to win on either the efficient allocation or on a1 b2 c2 which provides a surplus of 39. The reason is that these are the only two configurations which are within (e + 1) = 16 of being efficient for s1 (therefore one of them must be chosen by Phase A), and both provide more than surplus over s2s most efficient configuration (and this is sufficient in order to win in Phase B). Table 2 shows the progress of phase A. Initially all configuration have the same cost (165), so sellers bid on their lowest cost configuration which is a2 b1 c1 for both (with profit 80 to s1 and 90 to s2), and that translates to sub-bids on a2 b1 and b1 c1 . M1 contains the sub-configurations a2 b2 and b2 c1 of the highest value configuration a2 b2 c1 . Price is therefore decreased on a2 b1 and b1 c1 . After the price change, s1 has higher profit (74) on a1 b2 c2 and she therefore bids on a1 b2 and b2 c2 . Now (round 2) their prices go down, reducing the profit on a1 b2 c2 to 66 and therefore in round 3 s1 prefers a2 b1 c2 (profit 67). After the next price change the configurations a1 b2 c1 and a1 b2 c2 both become optimal (profit 66), and the subbids a1 b2 , b2 c1 and b2 c2 capture the two. These configurations stay optimal for another round (5), with profit 62. At this point s1 has a full bid (in fact two full bids: a1 b2 c2 and a1 b2 c1 ) in M5 , and I1 I2 t a1b1 a2b1 a1b2 a2b2 b1c1 b2c1 b1c2 b2c2 1 75 75 75 75 90 90 90 90 s1, s2 ∗ s1, s2 ∗ 2 75 71 75 75 86 90 90 90 s2 s1 ∗ s2 ∗ s1 3 75 67 71 75 82 90 90 86 s1, s2 ∗ s2 ∗ s1 ∗ 4 75 63 71 75 78 90 86 86 s2 s1 ∗ s2 ∗, s1 ∗, s1 5 75 59 67 75 74 90 86 86 s2 ∗, s1 ∗ s2 ∗, s1 ∗, s1 6 71 59 67 75 70 90 86 86 s2 ∗, s1 ∗ ∗, s1 s2 ∗, s1 7 71 55 67 75 70 90 82 86 s2 ∗, s1 ∗ s2 ∗, s1 ∗, s1 8 67 55 67 75 66 90 82 86 ∗ s2 ∗, s1 ∗ ∗ ∗, s1 s2 ∗, s1 9 67 51 67 75 66 90 78 86 ∗, s2 ∗, s1 ∗ ∗, s2 ∗, s1 ∗, s1 Table 2: Auction progression in phase A. Sell bids and designation of Mt (using ∗) are shown below the price of each subconfiguration. therefore she no longer changes her bids since the price of her optimal configurations does not decrease. s2 sticks to a2 b1 c1 during the first four rounds, switching to a1 b1 c1 in round 5. It takes four more rounds for s2 and Mt to converge (M10 ∩B10 2 = {a1 b1 c1 }). After round 9 the auction sets η1 = a1 b2 c1 (which yields more buyer profit than a1 b2 c2 ) and η2 = a1 b1 c1 . For the next round (10) Δ = 8, increased by 8 for each subsequent round. Note that p9 (a1 b1 c1 ) = 133, and c2(a1 b1 c1 ) = 90, therefore πT 2 (η2) = 43. In round 15, Δ = 48 meaning p15 (a1 b1 c1 ) = 85 and that causes s2 to drop out, setting the final allocation to (s1, a1 b2 c1 ) and p15 (a1 b2 c1 ) = 157 − 48 = 109. That leaves the buyer with a profit of 31 and s1 with a profit of 14, less than below the VCG profit 20. The welfare achieved in this case is optimal. To illustrate how some efficiency loss could occur consider the case that c1(b2 c2 ) = 60. In that case, in round 3 the configuration a1 b2 c2 provides the same profit (67) as a2 b1 c2 , and s1 bids on both. While a2 b1 c2 is no longer optimal after the price change, a1 b2 c2 remains optimal on subsequent rounds because b2 c2 ∈ Mt , and the price change of a1 b2 affects both a1 b2 c2 and the efficient configuration a1 b2 c1 . When phase A ends B10 1 ∩ M10 = {a1 b2 c2 } so the auction terminates with the slightly suboptimal configuration and surplus 40. 6. DISCUSSION 6.1 Preferential Assumptions A key aspect in implementing GAI based auctions is the choice of the preference structure, that is, the elements {I1, . . . , Ig}. In some domains the structure can be more or less robust over time and over different decision makers. When this is not the case, extracting reliable structure from sellers (in the form of CDI conditions) is a serious challenge. This could have been a deal breaker for such domains, but in fact it can be overcome. It turns out that we can run this auction without any assumptions on sellers preference structure. The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8. If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the auction 235 still hold. Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure. It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled. Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation. In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction. It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality. The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7]. In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit). Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment. In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments. In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted. When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions. Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition. We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay. Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties. It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.

Desarrollamos dicha estructura utilizando la teoría de las funciones de valor medibles, una representación de utilidad cardinal basada en un orden subyacente sobre las diferencias de preferencia. Un conjunto de relaciones de independencia condicional local sobre tales diferencias respalda una representación de preferencia aditiva generalizada, que descompone la utilidad a través de grupos superpuestos de atributos relacionados. Introducimos un mecanismo de subasta iterativo que mantiene los precios en grupos locales de atributos en lugar del espacio completo de configuraciones conjuntas. Cuando las preferencias de los comerciantes son consistentes con la estructura de aditivos generalizados de subastas, el mecanismo produce asignaciones aproximadamente óptimas, a precios de VCG aproximados.

Introducción Los mecanismos de comercio de títulos múltiples extienden los mecanismos tradicionales solo de precios al facilitar la negociación sobre un conjunto de atributos predefinidos que representan varios aspectos no comerciales del acuerdo. En lugar de negociar sobre un bien o servicio totalmente definido, un mecanismo de tiempo múltiple retrasa el compromiso con configuraciones específicas hasta que se identifiquen los candidatos más prometedores. Por ejemplo, un departamento de adquisiciones de una empresa puede usar una subasta de títulos múltiples para seleccionar un proveedor de discos duros. Las ofertas de proveedores pueden evaluarse no solo sobre el precio que ofrecen, sino también sobre varios atributos cualitativos como volumen, RPM, tiempo de acceso, latencia, tasa de transferencia, etc. Además, los proveedores pueden ofrecer diferentes condiciones de contrato, como garantía, tiempo de entrega y servicio. Para tener en cuenta las preferencias de los comerciantes, el mecanismo de subasta debe extraer información evaluativa sobre un dominio complejo de configuraciones multidimensionales. La construcción y comunicación de una especificación de preferencia completa puede ser una carga severa incluso para un número moderado de atributos, por lo tanto, las subastas prácticas de títulos múltiples deben acomodar especificaciones parciales o apoyar la expresión compacta de preferencias que suponen alguna forma simplificada. Con mucho, el formulario múltiple más popular para adoptar es el más simple: una representación aditiva donde el valor general es una combinación lineal de valores asociados con cada atributo. Por ejemplo, varias propuestas recientes para subastas iterativas de títulos múltiples [2, 3, 8, 19] requieren representaciones de preferencia aditiva. Dicha aditividad reduce la complejidad de la especificación de preferencia exponencialmente (en comparación con el caso discreto general), pero impide la expresión de cualquier interdependencia entre los atributos. En la práctica, sin embargo, las interdependencias entre los atributos naturales son bastante comunes. Por ejemplo, el comprador puede exhibir preferencias complementarias por tamaño y tiempo de acceso (ya que el efecto de rendimiento es más destacado si se trata de muchos datos), o puede ver una garantía sólida como un buen sustituto de las calificaciones de alta confiabilidad. Del mismo modo, las características de producción de los vendedores (como aumentar el tiempo de acceso son más difíciles para discos duros más grandes) pueden violar fácilmente la aditividad. En tales casos, una función de valor aditivo puede no ser capaz de proporcionar incluso una aproximación razonable de preferencias reales. Por otro lado, los modelos completamente generales son intratables, y es razonable esperar que las preferencias de títulos múltiples exhiban alguna estructura. Nuestro objetivo, por lo tanto, es identificar las representaciones estructuradas más sutil pero más ampliamente aplicables y explotar estas propiedades de las preferencias en los mecanismos comerciales. Proponemos un mecanismo de subasta iterativo basado en una estructura de preferencia tan flexible. Nuestro enfoque se inspira en el diseño de una subasta iterativa de adquisición de títulos múltiples para preferencias aditivas, debido a Parkes y Kalagnanam (PK) [19]. PK propone dos tipos de subastas iterativas: el primero (NLD) no hace suposiciones sobre las preferencias de los comerciantes y permite a los vendedores ofertar por el espacio de atributos multidimensional completo. Debido a que NLD mantiene una estructura de precios exponencial, es adecuada solo para dominios pequeños. La otra subasta (AD) asume la valoración del comprador aditivo y las funciones de costos del vendedor. Recopila ofertas de venta por nivel de atributo y para un solo término de descuento. El precio de una configuración se define como la suma de los precios de los niveles de atributo elegidos menos el descuento. La subasta que proponemos también admite espacios de precios compactos, aunque para niveles de grupos de atributos en lugar de solteros. Empleamos una descomposición de preferencia basada en la independencia de aditivos generalizados (GAI), un modelo lo suficientemente flexible como para acomodar las interdependencias al grado exacto de precisión deseado, pero proporciona una forma funcional compacta en la medida en que la interdependencia puede ser limitada. Dadas sus raíces en la teoría de la utilidad múltiple títulos [13], 227 La condición GAI se define con respecto a la función de utilidad esperada. Aplicarlo para los valores de modelado para ciertos resultados, por lo tanto, requiere una reinterpretación de preferencia bajo certeza. Con este fin, explotamos el hecho de que los resultados de la subasta están asociados con los precios continuos, que proporcionan una escala natural para evaluar la magnitud de la preferencia. Primero presentamos un marco de representación para las preferencias que capturan, además de ordenos simples entre los valores de configuración de atributos, la diferencia en la voluntad de pagar (WTP) para cada uno. Es decir, deberíamos poder no solo comparar los resultados, sino también decidir si la diferencia de calidad vale una diferencia dada en el precio. A continuación, construimos un enlace directo y formalmente justificado a partir de declaraciones de preferencia sobre resultados con precios a una descomposición aditiva generalizada de la función WTP. Después de exponer esta infraestructura, empleamos esta herramienta de representación para el desarrollo de un mecanismo de subasta iterativa de múltiples títulos que permite a los comerciantes expresar sus complejas preferencias en formato GAI. Luego estudiamos las propiedades de asignación, computacionales y prácticas de subastas. En la Sección 2 presentamos antecedentes esenciales en nuestro marco de representación, la función de valor medible (MVF). La Sección 3 desarrolla nuevas estructuras multiatributo para MVF, lo que respalda las descomposiciones aditivas generalizadas. A continuación, mostramos la aplicabilidad del marco teórico a las preferencias en el comercio. El resto del documento está dedicado al mecanismo de subasta propuesto.2. Preferencias de títulos múltiples Como se mencionó, la mayoría de las herramientas que facilitan la expresión del valor de títulos múltiples para las aplicaciones comerciales suponen que las preferencias de los agentes pueden representarse en forma aditiva. A modo de antecedentes, comenzamos introduciendo los requisitos previos formales que justifican la representación aditiva, según lo proporcionado por la teoría de la utilidad múltiple. Luego presentamos la forma aditiva generalizada y desarrollamos las bases formales para el valor medible necesario para extender este modelo al caso de elección bajo certeza.2.1 Independencia preferencial Deje θ denotar el espacio de posibles resultados, con una relación de preferencia (orden total débil) sobre θ. Sea a = {a0 ,..., am} ser un conjunto de atributos que describen θ. Las letras mayúsculas denotan subconjuntos de variables, letras pequeñas (con o sin subíndices numéricos) denotan variables específicas, y ¯x denota el complemento de x con respecto a A. Indicamos asignaciones de variables específicas con signos principales o superíndices. Para representar una instanciación de los subconjuntos x, y al mismo tiempo usamos una secuencia de símbolos de instanciación, como en x y. Definición 1. Un conjunto de atributos y ⊂ a es preferentemente independiente (PI) de su complemento z = a \\ y si el orden de preferencia condicional sobre y dado un nivel fijo Z0 de z es el mismo independientemente de la elección de z0. En otras palabras, el orden de preferencia sobre la proyección de A en los atributos en y es el mismo para cualquier instanciación de los atributos en Z. Definición 2. A = {a1 ,..., AM} es mutuamente preferentemente independiente (MPI) si algún subconjunto de A es preferentemente independiente de su complemento. La relación de preferencia cuando no se modela la incertidumbre generalmente está representada por una función de valor V [17]. El siguiente resultado fundamental simplifica enormemente la representación de la función de valor. Teorema 1 ([9]). Un orden de preferencia sobre el conjunto de atributos A tiene una representación de función de valor aditivo v (a1, ..., am) = mx i = 1 vi (ai) Iff a es mutuamente preferencial independiente. Esencialmente, las formas aditivas utilizadas en los mecanismos comerciales asumen la independencia mutua preferencial sobre el conjunto completo de atributos, incluido el atributo de dinero. Intuitivamente eso significa que la voluntad de pagar por el valor de un atributo o atributos no puede verse afectado por el valor de otros atributos. Una función de valor cardinal que representa un pedido sobre ciertos resultados no necesita coincidir en general con la función de utilidad cardinal que representa la preferencia sobre las loterías o la utilidad esperada (UE). Sin embargo, las funciones de la UE pueden poseer propiedades estructurales análogas a las de las funciones de valor, como la descomposición aditiva. Dado que el presente trabajo no implica decisiones bajo incertidumbre, no proporcionamos una exposición completa del concepto de la UE. Sin embargo, hacemos una referencia frecuente a las siguientes relaciones aditivas de independencia. Definición 3. Sea x, y, z una partición del conjunto de atributos A. x e y son condicionalmente aditivos independientes dado z, denotado como cai (x, y | z), si las preferencias sobre las loterías dependen solo de su probabilidad condicional marginaldistribuciones sobre x e y. Definición 4. Deja I1 ,..., Ig ⊆ A tal que Sg i = 1 ii = A. I1 ,..., IG se denominan aditivos generalizados independientes (GAI) si las preferencias sobre las loterías en A dependen solo de sus distribuciones marginales sobre I1 ,..., Yo G. Una función de utilidad (esperada) U (·) puede descomponerse aditivamente de acuerdo con sus subconfiguraciones GAI (posiblemente superpuestas). Teorema 2 ([13]). Deja I1 ,..., Ig be gai. Luego existen funciones F1 ,..., fg tal que u (a1, ..., am) = g x r = 1 fr (ir).(1) Lo que ahora se conoce como la condición GAI fue introducido originalmente por Fishburn [13] para la UE, y fue nombrado GAI y fue llamado a la atención de los investigadores de IA por Baco y Grove [1]. Se desarrollaron modelos gráficos y procedimientos de obtención para la utilidad descomponible GAI para la UE [4, 14, 6], para una representación cardinal de la función de valor ordinal [15], y para una relación de preferencia ordinal correspondiente a una estructura de red TCP por Brafman etAlabama.[5]. Además del trabajo sobre GAI en el contexto del manejo de preferencias que se discutieron anteriormente, GAI se ha utilizado recientemente en el contexto del diseño del mecanismo por Hyafil y Boutilier [16], como una ayuda en los mecanismos de revelación directa. Como se muestra en Bacchus y Grove [1], la estructura GAI se puede identificar en función de un conjunto de condiciones de CAI, que son mucho más fáciles de detectar y verificar. En general, las funciones de utilidad pueden exhibir una estructura GAI no basada en CAI. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha todas las propuestas de razonamiento y obtención de utilidad en forma GAI aprovechan la estructura GAI principalmente en la medida en que representa una colección de condiciones de CAI. Por ejemplo, los árboles GAI [14] emplean la triangulación del mapa CAI, y Braziunas y Boutiliers [6] Conjunto condicional CJ de un conjunto IJ corresponde al conjunto de separación de CAI de IJ. Dado que la condición CAI también se define en función de las preferencias sobre las loterías, no podemos aplicar el resultado de Baco y Groves sin establecer primero un marco alternativo basado en resultados con precios. Desarrollamos dicho marco utilizando la teoría de las funciones de valor medibles, produciendo en última instancia una descomposición GAI 228 (Ec. 1) de la función WTP. Los lectores interesados principalmente en la subasta de títulos múltiples y dispuestos a otorgar el bien fundamental de la estructura de preferencias pueden saltar hasta la Sección 5. 2.2 Funciones de valor medibles Las decisiones comerciales representan un caso especial de decisiones bajo certeza, donde las opciones involucran los resultados de múltiples atributos y los pagos monetarios correspondientes. En tales problemas, la decisión clave a menudo depende de las valoraciones relativas de las diferencias de precios en comparación con las diferencias en las configuraciones alternativas de bienes y servicios. Teóricamente, el precio puede tratarse como otro atributo, sin embargo, dicho enfoque no explota el carácter especial de la dimensión del dinero, y puede aumentar significativamente a la complejidad debido a la continuidad inherente y un amplio rango típico de posibles valores de resultados monetarios. Construimos sobre el trabajo fundamental de Dyer y Sarin [10, 11] en funciones de valor medibles (MVF). Como mostramos a continuación, WTP funciona en un entorno cuasi-lineal puede interpretarse como MVFS. Sin embargo, primero presentamos el marco MVF de una manera más genérica, donde la medición no es necesariamente monetaria. Presentamos las definiciones esenciales y nos referimos a Dyer y Sarin para obtener antecedentes más detallados y tratamiento axiomático. El concepto clave es el de la diferencia de preferencia. Sea θ1, θ2, ϑ1, ϑ2 ∈ θ tal que θ1 θ2 y ϑ1 ϑ2.[θ2, θ1] denota la diferencia de preferencia entre θ2 y θ1, interpretada como la fuerza, o grado, al que se prefiere θ2 sobre θ1. Deje ∗ denotar un orden de preferencia sobre θ × θ. Interpretamos la declaración [θ2, θ1] ∗ [ϑ2, ϑ1] como la preferencia de ϑ2 sobre ϑ1 es al menos tan fuerte como la preferencia de θ2 sobre θ1. Usamos el símbolo ∼ ∗ para representar la igualdad de diferencias de preferencia. Definición 5. U: D → es una función de valor medible (MVF) WRT ∗ si para cualquier θ1, θ2, ϑ1, ϑ2 ∈ D, [θ2, θ1] ∗ [ϑ2, ϑ1] ⇔ u (θ2) - u (θ1, θ2) ≤ u (ϑ2) - u (ϑ1). Tenga en cuenta que un MVF también se puede usar como una función de valor que representa, ya que [θ, θ] ∗ [θ, θ] iff θ θ. Definición 6 ([11]). Conjunto de atributos X ⊂ A se llama diferencia independiente de ¯x si para dos asignaciones x1 ¯x x2 ¯x, [x1 ¯x, x2 ¯x] ∼ ∗ [x1 ¯x, x2 ¯x] para cualquier asignación ¯x. O, en palabras, las diferencias de preferencia en las asignaciones a x dado un nivel fijo de ¯x no dependen del nivel particular elegido para ¯x. Al igual que con la independencia aditiva para la UE, esta condición es más fuerte que la independencia preferencial de X. También análoga a la UE, la independencia mutua preferencial combinada con otras condiciones conduce a la descomposición aditiva del MVF. Además, Dyer y Sarin [11] han definido análogos de independencia de servicios públicos [17] para MVF, y elaboraron un conjunto paralelo de resultados de descomposición.3. Estructuras MVF avanzadas 3.1 Diferencia condicional Independencia Nuestro primer paso es generalizar la definición 6 a una versión condicional. Definición 7. Sea x, y, z una partición del conjunto de atributos A. x es condicionalmente la diferencia independiente de y dada z, denotada como CDI (x, y | z), si ∀ instanciaciones ˆz, x1, x2, y 1, y2 [x1 y 1 ˆz, x2 y 1 ˆz] ∼ [x1 y 2 ˆz, x2 y 2 ˆz]. Dado que el conjunto condicional es siempre el complemento, a veces lo dejamos implícito, utilizando la notación abreviada CDI (x, y). CDI conduce a una descomposición similar a la obtenida de CAI [17]. Lema 3. Sea U (a) un MVF que representa las diferencias de preferencia. Entonces cdi (x, y | z) iff u (a) = u (x0, y, z) + u (x, y 0, z) - u (x0, y 0, z). Para completar la analogía con CAI, generalizamos el Lema 3 de la siguiente manera. Proposición 4. CDI (x, y | z) si existen funciones ψ1 (x, z) y ψ2 (y, z), de modo que u (x, y, z) = ψ1 (x, z) + ψ2 (y, z).(2) Un resultado inmediato de la Proposición 4 es que CDI es una relación simétrica. La condición de independencia condicional es mucho más aplicable que la incondicional. Por ejemplo, si los atributos a ∈ X y B /∈ X son complementos o sustitutos, x no puede ser una diferencia independiente de ¯x. Sin embargo, x \\ {a} aún puede ser CDI de ¯x dado a.3.2 Estructura GAI para MVF Una sola condición CDI descompone la función de valor en dos partes. Buscamos una descomposición global de grano más fino de la función de utilidad, similar a la obtenida de la independencia mutua preferencial. Para este propósito, ahora estamos listos para emplear los resultados de Baco y Grove [1], quienes establecen que la condición CAI tiene un mapa perfecto [20];es decir, existe un gráfico cuyos nodos corresponden al conjunto A, y su separación de nodos refleja exactamente el conjunto completo de condiciones CAI en A. Además, muestran que la función de utilidad se descompone sobre el conjunto de camarillas máximas del mapa perfecto. Sus pruebas se pueden adaptar fácilmente a CDI, ya que solo confían en la propiedad de descomposición de CAI que también implica con CDI según la Proposición 4. Teorema 5. Sea G = (A, E) un mapa perfecto para las condiciones de CDI en A. Entonces u (a) = g x r = 1 fr (ir), (3) donde i1 ,..., Ig son subconjuntos (superpuestos) de A, cada uno correspondiente a una camarilla máxima de G. Dada el Teorema 5, ahora podemos identificar una estructura GAI MVF de una colección de condiciones de CDI. Las condiciones de CDI, a su vez, son particularmente intuitivas para detectar cuándo las diferencias de preferencia tienen una interpretación directa, como en el caso de las diferencias monetarias que se analizan a continuación. Además, la suposición o detección de condiciones de CDI se puede realizar de forma incremental, hasta que el MVF se descomponga a una dimensión razonable. Esto contrasta con la descomposición totalmente aditiva de MVF que requiere independencia preferencial mutua [11]. El teorema 5 define una estructura de descomposición, pero para representar el MVF real necesitamos especificar las funciones sobre las camarillas.229 El siguiente teorema establece que los componentes funcionales de MVF son los mismos que los de las descomposiciones GAI definidas por Fishburn [13] para la UE. Adoptamos la siguiente notación convencional. Sea (A0 1, ..., a0 m) un vector predefinido llamado resultado de referencia. Para cualquiera de cualquier I ⊆ A, la función u ([i]) representa la proyección de u (a) a i donde el resto de los atributos se fijan en sus niveles de referencia. Teorema 6. Deje que G = (a, e) sea un mapa perfecto para la condición CDI en a, y {i1 ,..., Ig} Un conjunto de camarillas máximas como se define en el teorema 5. Entonces la descomposición funcional de ese teorema puede definirse como F1 = U ([i1]), y para r = 2 ,..., g (4) fr = u ([ir]) + r - 1x k = 1 (−1) k x 1≤i1 <···> <ik <r u ([k \\ s = 1 iis ∩ ir]) elLa prueba muestra directamente que si el gráfico g = (a, e) es un mapa perfecto de CDI, u (a) se descompone a una suma sobre las funciones definidas en (4) .1 Por lo tanto, esta prueba no se basa en el resultado de descomposición del teorema5, solo en la existencia del mapa perfecto. Para resumir, los resultados de esta sección generalizan la teoría aditiva de MVF. En particular, justifica la aplicación de métodos desarrollados recientemente bajo el marco de la UE [1, 4, 14, 6] a la representación del valor bajo certeza.4. La voluntad de pago como una construcción de MVF 4.1 En esta sección aplicamos un valor medible para representar diferencias de disposición a pagar los resultados. Suponemos que el agente tiene una orden de preferencia sobre el espacio de resultado, representado por un conjunto de atributos A, y un atributo P que representa la consecuencia monetaria. Tenga en cuenta que al evaluar una decisión de compra, P correspondería a los agentes Netings Net de la transacción (es decir, riqueza después de la compra), no al precio de compra. Un resultado en este espacio está representado, por ejemplo, por (θ, p), donde θ es una instanciación de A y P es un valor de p.Además suponemos que las preferencias son cuasi-lineales en P, es decir, existe una función de valor de la forma V (a, p) = u (a) + l (p), donde l es una función lineal positiva.2 El cuasi-La la forma lineal califica inmediatamente el dinero como una medida de las diferencias de preferencia y establece una escala monetaria para U (a). Definición 8. Deje que V (a, p) = u (a)+l (p) represente, donde p es el atributo que representa el dinero. Llamamos a U (a) una función de voluntad para pagar (WTP). Tenga en cuenta que WTP también puede referirse a la voluntad de los vendedores para aceptar la función. El WTP U (a) es una función cardinal, única hasta una transformación lineal positiva. Dado que (θ1, p) (θ2, p) ⇔ u (θ1) - u (θ2) ≤ l (p - p), (donde θ1, θ1 ∈ θ, el dominio de a) la función WTP puede usarse para elegirEntre resultados con precios.1 Esta prueba y la mayoría de las otras pruebas en este documento se omiten para la consideración del espacio, y están disponibles en un apéndice en línea.2 En muchas solicitudes de adquisición, los acuerdos en cuestión son pequeños en relación con las empresas involucradas, por lo que se justifica la suposición de cuasi-linealidad. Esta suposición puede relajarse a una condición llamada compensaciones correspondientes [17], que no requiere que el valor sobre el dinero sea lineal. Sin embargo, para simplificar la presentación, mantenemos la suposición más fuerte. Naturalmente, la obtención de la función WTP es más intuitiva cuando se usa valores monetarios directos. En otras palabras, provocamos una función en la que l (p) = p, entonces v (a, p) = u (a) + p.Definimos un resultado de referencia (θ0, p0), y asumiendo la continuidad de P, para cualquier asignación ˆθ existe A ˆP tal que (ˆθ, ˆp) ∼ (θ0, p0). Como V se normaliza de tal manera que V (θ0, p0) = 0, ˆp se interpreta como el WTP para ˆθ, o el precio de reserva de ˆθ. Proposición 7. La función WTP es un MVF sobre las diferencias en los precios de reserva. Observamos que la función WTP se usa ampliamente en economía, y que todo el desarrollo en la Sección 3 podría realizarse directamente en términos de WTP, confiando en cuasi-linealidad para la medición de preferencias y sin formalización utilizando MVFS. Sin embargo, esta formalización alinea este trabajo con la teoría de la independencia de la diferencia fundamental de Dyer y Sarin. Además de facilitar la detección de la estructura GAI, la condición CDI respalda la obtención de medidas utilizando consultas locales, similar a la forma en que Braziunas y Boutilier utiliza CAI [6]. Adoptamos su definición de conjunto condicional de IR, señalado aquí Sr, como el conjunto de vecinos de atributos en IR sin incluir los atributos de IR. Claramente, SR es el conjunto de separación de IR en el mapa CDI, por lo tanto, CDI (IR, VR), donde VR = A \\ (IR ∪ Sr). De la definición de CDI, para cualquier V 1 R, V 2 R tenemos: U (I1 R S0 R V 1 R) - U (I2 R S0 R V 1 R) = U (I1 R S0 R V 2 R)- U (I2 R S0 R V 2 R). Por lo tanto, provocar la función WTP equivale a provocar la utilidad (WTP) de un resultado completo (el resultado de referencia θ0), y luego obtener la función sobre cada camarilla máxima utilizando diferencias monetarias entre sus posibles asignaciones (técnica conocida como precio [17]), manteniendo las variables en el conjunto condicional fijo. Estas consultas de obtención de ceteris paribus son locales en el sentido de que el agente no necesita considerar los valores del resto de los atributos. Además, al obtener MVFS podemos evitar el paso de escala global que se requiere para las funciones de la UE. Dado que las diferencias de preferencia se extraen con respecto a cantidades específicas del atributo P, la utilidad ya está escalada de acuerdo con esa medida externa. Por lo tanto, una vez que se obtienen las funciones de utilidad condicional U ([IJ]), podemos calcular U (a) según (4). Este último paso puede requerir (en el peor de los casos) el cálculo de varios términos que son exponenciales en el número de camarillas máximas. Sin embargo, en la práctica no esperamos que la intersección de las camarillas sea tan profunda;La intersección de más que unas pocas camarillas máximas normalmente estaría vacía. Para aprovechar eso, podemos usar el algoritmo de búsqueda sugerido por Braziunas y Boutilier [6], que encuentra eficientemente todas las intersecciones no vacías para cada camarilla.4.2 Optimización Como se muestra, la función WTP se puede usar directamente para comparaciones por pares de resultados con precios. Otra consulta de preferencia a menudo tratada en la literatura es la optimización, o la elección del mejor resultado, posiblemente bajo limitaciones. Las decisiones típicas sobre el intercambio de un bien o de servicio exhiben lo que llamamos independencia preferencial de primer orden (FOPI), bajo la cual la mayoría o todos los atributos individuales tienen un orden natural de calidad, independientemente de los valores del resto.3 Por ejemplo, al elegirUna PC siempre preferimos más memoria, CPU más rápida, garantía más larga, etc. Bajo FOPI, la optimización no restringida de 3 esto no debe confundirse con la condición altamente exigente de la independencia mutua preferencial, que requiere que todas las compensaciones entre los atributos sean independientes.230 Los resultados imprecientes son triviales, por lo tanto, consideramos la elección entre los puntos de atributo con los precios. Dado que cualquier resultado puede tener suficiente compensación monetaria, este problema no está bien definido a menos que las combinaciones estén limitadas de alguna manera. Un problema de optimización particularmente interesante surge en el contexto de la negociación, donde consideramos la utilidad de los compradores y vendedores. El problema de coincidencia de títulos múltiples (MMP) [12] se ocupa de encontrar un punto de atributo que maximice el excedente de un comercio, o la diferencia entre los servicios públicos del comprador y el vendedor, ub (a) - US (a). GAI, como descomposición aditiva, tiene la propiedad de que si Ub y nosotros están en forma gai, entonces Ub (a) −us (a) también está en forma gai. Por lo tanto, podemos usar procedimientos de optimización combinatoria para la descomposición de GAI, basados en los esquemas de eliminación variable bien estudiados (por ejemplo, [15]) para encontrar el mejor punto de negociación. Del mismo modo, esta optimización se puede hacer para maximizar el excedente entre una función de utilidad de comerciantes y un sistema de precios que asigna un precio a cada nivel de cada elemento GAI, y de esta manera guía a los operadores a sus puntos de licitación óptimos. En el resto del documento, desarrollamos una subasta de adquisición de títulos múltiples que se basa en esta idea.5. GAI en subastas de títulos múltiples 5.1 El problema de adquisición de títulos múltiples en la configuración de adquisiciones Un solo comprador desea adquirir un solo bien, en alguna configuración θ ∈ θ de uno de los vendedores candidatos S1 ,..., sn. El comprador tiene una función de valoración privada (WTP) UB: θ → R, y de manera similar cada vendedor SI tiene una función de valoración privada (disposición a aceptar). Para el cumplimiento de la literatura de adquisiciones, nos referimos a la valoración del Vendedor como una función de costo, denotada por CI. El problema de asignación de múltiples tributas (MAP) [19] es el problema de optimización de bienestar en la adquisición sobre un dominio discreto, y se define como: i ∗, θ ∗ = arg max i, θ (ub (θ) - ci (θ)).(5) Para ilustrar la necesidad de un espacio de precios GAI, consideramos el caso de los comerciantes con preferencias no aditivas ofertas en un espacio de precios aditivo como en la subasta PKS AD. Si las preferencias de los compradores no son aditivas, elegir los niveles preferidos por atributo (como en la subasta AD) admite combinaciones no deseadas y no guía a los vendedores a las configuraciones eficientes. Los vendedores no aditivos enfrentan un problema de exposición, algo análogo a los comerciantes con preferencias complementarias que participan en subastas simultáneas. Un valor A1 para el atributo A puede ser óptimo dado que el valor de otro atributo B es B1, y arbitrariamente subóptimos dados otros valores de b. Por lo tanto, las ofertas A1 y B1 pueden dar como resultado una asignación deficiente si el vendedor está superado por B1, pero la izquierda tiene A1 .4 En lugar de asumir la aditividad total, el diseñador de la subasta puede encontrar una estructura de preferencias GAI que captura el conjunto de interdependencias comunes entre atributos entre atributos. Si los comerciantes pudieran ofertar por grupos de atributos interdependientes, resolvería los problemas discutidos anteriormente. Por ejemplo, si A y B son interdependientes (lo que significa que CDI (A, B) no se mantiene), deberíamos poder ofertar por el clúster AB. Si B a su vez depende de C, necesitamos otro clúster BC. Esto sigue siendo mejor que una estructura de precios general que solicita ofertas para el clúster ABC. Hacemos hincapié en que cada comerciante puede tener un conjunto diferente de interdependencias y, por lo tanto, para ser completamente general, los 4 si solo los vendedores no son aditivos, el diseño de la subasta podría aliviar este problema mediante la recolección de un nuevo conjunto de ofertas en cada ronda y olvidando ofertas.Desde rondas anteriores, y también guiar a los vendedores no aditivos a ofertar solo por un nivel por atributo para evitar combinaciones no deseadas.Ya yb yc z z (i) ¨ © a, b ¨ © b, c (ii) Figura 1: (i) mapa CDI para {a, b, c}, reflejando la condición única CDI (a, c).(ii) la red GAI correspondiente. La estructura GAI debe tener en cuenta todo.5 Sin embargo, en la práctica, muchos dominios tienen dependencias naturales que son mutuas para los comerciantes.5.2 Los árboles GAI suponen que las preferencias de todos los comerciantes se reflejan en una estructura gai i1 ,..., Yo G. Llamamos a cada elemento IR un elemento GAI, y cualquier tarea para una subfiguración. Usamos θr para denotar la subconfiguración formada mediante la proyección de configuración θ a elemento IR. Definición 9. Sea α una asignación a IR y β una asignación a IR. Las subconfiguraciones α y β son consistentes si para algún atributo AJ ∈ Ir ∩ Ir, α y β coinciden en el valor de AJ. Una colección ν de subconfiguraciones es consistente si todos los pares α, β ∈ ν son consistentes. La colección se llama cubierta si contiene exactamente una subfiguración αR correspondiente a cada elemento ir, r ∈ {1 ,..., G}. Tenga en cuenta que una cubierta consistente {α1 ,..., αg} representa una configuración completa, que denotamos por (α1, ..., αg). Una red GAI es un gráfico G cuyos nodos corresponden a los elementos GAI i1 ,..., Ig, con una ventaja entre IR, IR IR IR ∩ ir = ∅. De manera equivalente, una red GAI es la gráfica de camarilla de un mapa CDI. Para justificar la estructura de precios compactos, requerimos que para cualquier conjunto de configuraciones óptimas (WRT una función de utilidad dada), con una colección correspondiente de subconfiguraciones γ, todas las cubiertas consistentes en γ también deben ser configuraciones óptimas. Para garantizar esto (ver Lemmas 8 y 10), asumimos una descomposición gai en forma de un árbol o un bosque (el árbol gai). Se puede lograr una estructura de árbol para cualquier conjunto de condiciones de CDI mediante la triangulación del mapa CDI antes de la construcción del gráfico de camarilla (las redes GAI y los árboles GAI están definidos por Gonzales y Perny [14], que también proporcionan un algoritmo de triangulación). Bajo GAI, los compradores valoran la función UB y los vendedores de funciones de costos CI se pueden descomponer como en (1). Utilizamos FB, R y FI, R para denotar las funciones locales de los compradores y vendedores (respectivamente), según (4). Por ejemplo, considere la adquisición de un bien con tres atributos, a, b, c.Cada dominio de atributos tiene dos valores (por ejemplo, {a1, a2} es el dominio de a). Deje que la estructura gai sea i1 = {a, b}, i2 = {b, c}. La Figura 1 muestra el mapa CDI simple y la red GAI correspondiente, que es un árbol GAI. Aquí, las subconfiguraciones son asignaciones de la forma A1 B1, A1 B2, B1 C1, y así sucesivamente. El conjunto de subconfiguraciones {A1 B1, B1 C1} es una cubierta consistente, correspondiente a la configuración A1 B1 C1. En contraste, el conjunto {A1 B1, B2 C1} es inconsistente.5.3 La subasta GAI definimos una subasta iterativa de típulos múltiples que mantiene una estructura de precios GAI: es decir, un precio PT (·) correspondiente a cada subconfiguración de cada elemento GAI-árbol. El precio de una configuración θ en el tiempo t se define como pt (θ) = g x r = 1 pt (θr) - δ.5 Relajamos este requisito en la Sección 6. 231 Los licitadores envían subconestiles sobre subconfiguraciones y en un término de descuento global adicional Δ.6 Sub-Bids siempre se envían para los precios actuales, y deben volver a ser reenviados en cada ronda, por lo tanto, ellosNo es necesario llevar explícitamente el precio. El conjunto de ofertas completas de un vendedor contiene todas las cubiertas consistentes que se pueden generar a partir del conjunto actual de sub-Bids de los vendedores. La existencia de una oferta completa sobre una configuración θ representa a los vendedores la voluntad de aceptar el precio PT (θ) para suministrar θ. Al comienzo de la subasta, el comprador informa (a la subasta, no a los vendedores) su valoración completa en forma GAI. Los precios iniciales de las subconfiguraciones se establecen en algún nivel por encima de las valoraciones de los compradores, es decir, p1 (θr)> fb, r (θr) para todos θr. El descuento δ se inicializa a cero. La subasta tiene la dinámica de una subasta de reloj descendente: en cada ronda T, las ofertas se recaudan para los precios actuales y luego los precios se reducen de acuerdo con las reglas de precios. Un vendedor se considera activo en una ronda si presenta al menos una oferta completa. En la ronda T> 1, solo los vendedores que están activos en la ronda T - 1 pueden participar, y la subasta termina cuando no es más de un solo vendedor activo. Denotamos el conjunto de subconsador enviado por Si por BT I, y el conjunto correspondiente de ofertas completas es BT i = {θ = (θ1, ..., θg) ∈ θ |∀r.θr ∈ Bt I}. En nuestro ejemplo, un vendedor podría enviar subconocadores en un conjunto de subconfiguraciones como A1 B1 y B1 C1, y eso se combina a una oferta completa en A1 B1 C1. La subasta procede en dos fases. En la primera fase (a), en cada ronda T, la subasta calcula un conjunto de subconfiguraciones preferidas MT. La Sección 5.4 muestra cómo definir MT para garantizar la convergencia, y la Sección 5.5 muestra cómo calcularlo de manera eficiente. En la fase A, la subasta ajusta los precios después de cada ronda, reduciendo el precio de cada subfiguración que ha recibido una oferta pero no está en el conjunto preferido. Sea el parámetro de incremento de precios precificado. Específicamente, la regla de cambio de precio de fase A se aplica a todos θr ∈ Sn i = 1 bt i \\ mt: pt+1 (θr) ← max (pt (θr) - g, fb, r (θr)).[A] El máximo de RHS asegura que los precios no se reducen por debajo de la valoración de los compradores en la fase A. Deje que MT denote el conjunto de configuraciones que son cubiertas consistentes en mt: mt = {θ = (θ1, ..., θg) ∈ θ |∀r.θr ∈ MT} La subasta cambia a la fase B cuando todos los vendedores activos tienen al menos una oferta completa en el conjunto preferido de los compradores: ∀i. Bt i = ∅ ∨ bt i ∩ mt = ∅.[Switch] Sea t la ronda en la que [el interruptor] se vuelve verdadero. En este punto, la subasta selecciona la oferta completa óptima del comprador ηi para cada vendedor SI.ηi = arg max θ∈Bt I (ub (θ) - pt (θ)).(6) En la fase B, Si solo puede ofertar en ηi. Los precios de las subconfiguraciones se fijan en PT (·) durante esta fase. El único ajuste en la fase B es δ, que aumenta en cada ronda por. La subasta termina cuando como máximo un vendedor (si es exactamente uno, designa Sˆi) está activa. Hay cuatro casos distintos: 1. Todos los vendedores abandonan en la fase A (es decir, antes de que se mantenga la regla [Switch]). La subasta regresa sin asignación.6 El término de descuento podría reemplazarse por una reducción de precios uniforme en todas las subfiguraciones.2. Todos los vendedores activos abandonan en la misma ronda en la fase B. La subasta selecciona al best seller (Sˆi) de la ronda anterior y aplica el caso aplicable a continuación.3. La subasta termina en la fase B con un precio final por encima de la valoración de los compradores, pt (ηˆi) - δ> ub (ηˆi). La subasta ofrece al ganador sˆi la oportunidad de suministrar ηˆi al precio ub (ηˆi).4. La subasta termina en la fase B con un precio final PT (ηˆi) - Δ ≤ ub (ηˆi). Esta es la situación ideal, donde la subasta asigna la configuración elegida y el vendedor a este precio resultante. La subasta general se describe mediante pseudocódigo de alto nivel en el algoritmo 1. Como se explica en la Sección 5.4, el papel de la Fase A es guiar a los operadores a sus configuraciones eficientes. La fase B es una competencia unidimensional sobre el excedente que los candidatos al vendedor restantes pueden proporcionar al comprador. En la Sección 5.5 discutimos las tareas computacionales asociadas con la subasta, y la Sección 5.6 proporciona un ejemplo detallado. Algoritmo 1 subasta multiatribución basada en GAI Recoja una valoración reportada, ˆV del comprador establece altos precios iniciales, p1 (θr) en cada nivel θr, y establece δ = 0 mientras que [cambiar] recolecta sub-bids de vendedores computar MT aplicarEl cambio de precio al final [a] mientras calcula ηi, mientras que más de un vendedor activo aumenta δ al recoger ofertas en (ηi, δ) de los vendedores finalizando mientras implementan la asignación y el pago al análisis económico del vendedor 5.4 cuando la solución óptima para mapear (5 (5) proporciona bienestar negativo y los vendedores no ofertan por debajo de su costo, la subasta termina en la fase A, no se produce comercio y la subasta es trivialmente eficiente. Por lo tanto, asumimos a lo largo del análisis que el par óptimo (vendedor, configuración) proporciona bienestar no negativo. La ganancia del comprador de una configuración θ se define como7 πb (θ) = ub (θ) - p (θ) y de manera similar πi (θ) = p (θ) - ci (θ) es el beneficio de Si. Además, para μ ⊆ {1 ,..., G} Denotamos el conjunto correspondiente de subconfiguraciones por θμ, y definimos la ganancia de una configuración θ sobre el subconjunto μ como πb (θμ) = x r∈μ (fb, r (θr) - p (θr)).πi (θμ) se define de manera similar para Si. Crucialmente, para cualquier μ y su complemento ¯μ y para cualquier comerciante τ, πτ (θ) = πτ (θμ) + πτ (θ¯μ). La función σi: θ → R representa el bienestar o la función excedente ub (·) - ci (·). Para cualquier sistema de precios p, σi (θ) = πb (θ) + πi (θ).7 Dejamos caer el Superscript en declaraciones genéricas que involucran funciones de precio y ganancias, entendiendo que todo el uso es con respecto a los precios (actualmente) aplicables.232 Dado que no asumimos nada sobre la estrategia de compradores, el análisis se refiere a ganancias y excedentes con respecto al valor nominal del informe de los compradores. Las funciones πi y σi se refieren a las funciones de costo verdaderas de Si. Definición 10. Un vendedor se llama postor sencillo (SB) si en cada ronda t ella oferta en bt i como sigue: si maxθ∈θ πt i (θ) <0, entonces bt i = ∅. De lo contrario, deje ωt i ⊆ arg max θ∈θ πt i (θ) bt i = {θr |θ ∈ ωt i, r ∈ {1 ,..., G}}. Intuitivamente, un vendedor de SB sigue una estrategia de mejor respuesta miope (MBR), lo que significa que ofertaron mioópicamente en lugar de estratégicamente optimizando sus ganancias con respecto a los precios actuales. Para calcular BT I, los vendedores deben optimizar su función de ganancia actual, como se discute en la Sección 4.2. El siguiente lema une la brecha aparente entre el precio compacto y la estructura de ofertas y la optimización global realizada por los operadores. Lema 8. Sea ψ un conjunto de configuraciones, todas las ganancias de maximización para un comerciante τ (vendedor o comprador) a los precios relevantes. Sea φ = {θr |θ ∈ ψ, r ∈ {1 ,..., G}. Entonces cualquier cubierta consistente en φ también es una configuración de maximización de ganancias para τ. Boceto de prueba (prueba completa en el apéndice en línea): una fuente de un elemento θr es una configuración ˜θ ∈ ψ de la que se originó (es decir, ˜θr = θr). A partir de la cubierta supuestamente subóptima θ1, construimos una serie de cubiertas θ1 ,..., θl. En cada uno θj volteamos el valor de un conjunto de subconfiguraciones μJ correspondientes a un subárbol, con las subconfiguraciones de la configuración ˆθj ∈ ψ, que es la fuente del γj principal de μJ. Eso asegura que todos los elementos en μJ ∪ {γj} tengan una fuente mutua ˆθj. Mostramos que todos los θj son consistentes y que todos deben ser subóptimos también, y dado que todos los elementos de θl tienen una fuente mutua, que significa θl = ˆθl ∈ ψ, contradice la optimización de ψ.Corolario 9. Para el vendedor SB Si, ∀t, ∀θ ∈ Bt I, πt I (θ) = max θ∈θ πt I (θ). A continuación, consideramos combinaciones de configuraciones que solo están dentro de un Δ de optimización. Lema 10. Sea ψ un conjunto de configuraciones, todas están dentro de δ de maximizar las ganancias para un comerciante τ a los precios, y φ definido como en Lemma 8. Entonces cualquier cubierta consistente en φ está dentro de ΔG de maximizar la utilidad para τ. Este límite es apretado, es decir, para cualquier árbol GAI y un dominio no trivial, podemos construir un conjunto ψ como arriba en el que existe una cubierta consistente cuya utilidad está exactamente ΔG por debajo del máximo. A continuación, definimos formalmente MT. Para los árboles GAI conectados, MT es el conjunto de subconfiguraciones que forman parte de una configuración dentro de Optimal. Cuando el árbol GAI es de hecho un bosque, distribuimos el error proporcionalmente a través de los árboles desconectados. Deje que G esté compuesto por árboles G1 ,..., GH. Usamos θj para denotar la proyección de una configuración θ en el árbol GJ, y GJ denota el número de elementos GAI en GJ. Mt j = {θr |πt b (θj) ≥ max θj ∈θj πt b (θj) - gj g, r ∈ Gj} y luego defina mt = sh j = 1 mt j. Deje que EJ = GJ −1 denote el número de bordes en GJ. Definimos el parámetro de conectividad, e = maxj = 1, ..., H EJ. Como se muestra a continuación, este parámetro de conectividad es un factor importante en el rendimiento de la subasta. Corolario 11. ∀θ ∈ MT, πt B (θ) ≥ max θ∈θ πt B (θ) - (e + 1) En el caso completamente aditivo se reduce esta pérdida de eficiencia. En el otro extremo, si la red GAI está conectada, entonces E+1 = g.También observamos que sin asumir ninguna estructura de preferencia, lo que significa que el mapa CDI está completamente conectado, G = 1 y la pérdida de eficiencia está nuevamente. Lemmas 12 a 15 muestran que a través del sistema de precios, la elección de las configuraciones preferidas del comprador y las reglas de cambio de precios, la fase A lleva al comprador y a cada uno de los vendedores a su configuración mutuamente eficiente. Lema 12. Maxθ∈θ πt B (θ) no cambia en ninguna redonda de la fase A. PRUEBA. Probamos el lema por cada árbol GJ. Los valores óptimos para los componentes desconectados son independientes entre sí, por lo tanto, si el beneficio máximo para cada componente no cambia el beneficio máximo combinado tampoco cambia también. Si el precio de θj se redujo durante la fase A, es decir, pt+1 (θj) = pt (θj)-δ, debe ser el caso de que algunas subconfiguraciones w ≤ gj de θj no están en mt j, y δ= W g. La definición de mt j garantiza πt b (θj) <max θ∈θ πt b (θj) - gj g. Por lo tanto, πt + 1 b (θ) = πt (θ) + δ = πt (θ) + w g ≤ max θ∈θ πt B (θj). Esto es cierto para cualquier configuración cuya ganancia mejore, por lo tanto, la ganancia máxima del comprador no cambia durante la fase A. Lemma 13. El precio de al menos una subfiguración debe reducirse en cada ronda de la fase A. PRUEBA. En cada ronda t <t de la fase A existe un vendedor activo i para quien bt i ∩ mt = ∅. Sin embargo, estar activo en la ronda T, Bt i = ∅. Deje ˆθ ∈ Bt i. Si ∀r.ˆθr ∈ Mt, entonces ˆθ ∈ Mt por definición de mt. Por lo tanto, debe haber ˆθr ∈ Mt. Necesitamos demostrar que para al menos una de estas subconfiguraciones, πt b (ˆθr) <0 para garantizar la activación de la regla [a]. Suponga para la contradicción de que para cualquier ˆθr ∈ ¯mt, πt b (ˆθr) ≥ 0. Por simplicidad, suponemos que para cualquier θr, π1 b (θr) es algún producto de g (que se puede hacer fácilmente), y eso asegura que πt b (ˆθr) = 0 porque una vez que la ganancia alcanza 0 no puede aumentar por regla [a] Si ˆθr ∈ ¯mt, ∀r = 1 ,..., g entonces πt B (ˆθ) = 0. Esto contradice el Lema 12 ya que establecemos altos precios iniciales. Por lo tanto, algunas de las subconfiguraciones de ˆθ están en MT, y Wlog suponemos que es ˆθ1 ,..., ˆΘk. Para estar en MT, estas subconfiguraciones k deben haber estado en una configuración completa preferida, lo que significa que existe θ ∈ Mt tal que θ = (ˆθ1, ..., ˆθk, θk+1, ..., θg) desde ˆθ /∈ Mt debe ser ese caso que πt b (ˆθ) <πt b (θ). Por lo tanto, πt b (θk+1, ..., θg)> πt b (ˆθk+1, ..., ˆθg) = 0 Por lo tanto, para al menos un r ∈ {k+1 ,..., g}, πt B (θr)> 0 Regla contradictible [a].233 Lema 14. Cuando la solución al mapa proporciona excedentes positivos, y al menos el best seller es SB, la subasta debe alcanzar la fase B. PRUEBA. Por Lema 13 Los precios deben disminuir en cada ronda de fase A. La regla [a] establece un límite inferior en todos los precios, por lo tanto, la subasta termina en la fase A o debe alcanzar la condición [interruptor]. Establecimos los precios iniciales son altos de tal manera que maxθ∈θ π1 b (θ) <0, y por lema 12 maxθ∈θ πt b (θ) <0 durante la fase A. Suponemos que la asignación eficiente (θ ∗, i ∗) proporciona un bienestar positivo, es decir σi ∗ (θ ∗) = πt b (θ ∗) + πt i ∗ (θ ∗)> 0. si ∗ es sb, por lo tanto, ella lo hará.Deje la subasta solo cuando πt i ∗ (θ ∗) <0. Esto solo puede suceder cuando πt B (θ ∗)> 0, por lo tanto, Si ∗ no cae en la fase A, por lo tanto, la subasta no puede terminar antes de alcanzar la condición [interruptor]. Lema 15. Para el vendedor SB SI, ηi es (e + 1) -eficiente. PRUEBA.ηi se elige para maximizar el excedente de los compradores fuera de BT I al final de la fase A. Dado que bt i ∩ mt = ∅, claramente ηi ∈ Mt. Del corolario 11 y el corolario 9, para cualquier ˜θ, πt b (ηi) ≥ πt b (˜θ) - (e + 1) πt i (ηi) ≥ πt i (˜θ) ⇒ σi (ηi) ≥ σi (˜θ) - (e + 1) Esto establece la eficiencia bilateral aproximada de los resultados de la fase A (en este punto bajo el supuesto de SB). Basado en el papel simple de fase BS como una competencia de licitación de una sola dimensión sobre el descuento, luego afirmamos que el resultado general es eficiente bajo SB, lo que a su vez demuestra ser una estrategia de equilibrio de aproximadamente ex post en las dos fases. Lema 16. Si los vendedores SI y SJ son SB, y SI está activo al menos mientras SJ esté activo en la fase B, entonces σi (ηi) ≥ max θ∈θ σj (θ) - (e + 2). Teorema 17. Dado un comprador sincero y vendedores de SB, la subasta es (e + 2) -eficiente: el excedente de la asignación final está dentro (e + 2) del excedente máximo. Después de PK, confiamos en una equivalencia a la subasta VCG unilateral para establecer propiedades de incentivos para los vendedores. En la subasta de VCG multiattribido múltiple, los compradores y los vendedores informan las funciones de valoración y costos ˆub, ˆci, y el comprador paga el pago de VCG del lado de la venta al vendedor ganador. Definición 11. Sea (θ ∗, i ∗) la solución óptima para mapear. Sea (˜θ, ˜i) la mejor solución para mapear cuando ∗ no participa. El pago VCG del lado de la venta es V Cg (ˆub, ˆci) = ˆub (θ ∗)-(ˆub (˜θ)-ˆc˜i (˜θ)). Es bien sabido que la licitación sincera es una estrategia dominante para los vendedores en la subasta de VCG unilateral. PK también demuestra que el arrepentimiento máximo para los compradores de ofertar con sinceridad en este mecanismo es Ub (θ ∗) - Ci ∗ (θ ∗) - (ub (˜θ) - ˆc˜i (˜θ)), es decir, el producto marginal del vendedor eficiente. Por lo general, en las subastas iterativas, el resultado de VCG solo casi se logra, pero la desviación está limitada por el cambio de precio mínimo. Mostramos un resultado similar y, por lo tanto, definimos los pagos de δ-VCG. Definición 12. El pago δ-VCG del lado de la venta para MAP es un pago p tal que v cg (ˆub, ˆci)-δ ≤ p ≤ v cg (ˆub, ˆci) + Δ. Cuando se garantiza que el pago sea los vendedores de VCG δ solo pueden afectar su pago dentro de ese rango, por lo tanto, su ganancia informando falsamente su costo está limitado por 2Δ. Lema 18. Cuando los vendedores son SB, el pago al final de la subasta GAI es el lado de la venta (e + 2) -vcg. Teorema 19. SB es un (3e + 5) Equilibrio Nash ex-post para vendedores en una subasta GAI. Es decir, los vendedores no pueden ganar más de (3e + 5) desviándose. En la práctica, sin embargo, es poco probable que los vendedores tengan la información que les permita explotar esa posible ganancia. Es mucho más probable que pierdan ofertas por sus configuraciones menos atractivas.5.5 Cálculo y complejidad El tamaño del espacio de precios mantenido en la subasta es igual al número total de subconfiguraciones, lo que significa que es exponencial en Maxr | ir | Esto también es equivalente al ancho de árbol (más uno) del mapa CDI original. A los efectos del análisis computacional, DJ denota el dominio del atributo AJ, e i = sg r = 1 q j∈ir DJ, la recopilación de todas las subfiguraciones. El primer propósito de esta subsección es mostrar que la complejidad de todos los cálculos requeridos para la subasta depende solo de | i |, es decir, ningún cálculo depende del tamaño del dominio exponencial completo. Primero nos preocupa el cálculo de MT. Dado que MT crece monotónicamente con T, una aplicación ingenua del algoritmo de optimización para generar los mejores resultados secuencialmente podría terminar enumerando porciones significativas del dominio completamente exponencial. Sin embargo, como se muestra debajo, se puede evitar esta enumeración simple. Proposición 20. El cálculo de MT se puede hacer en el tiempo o (| i | 2). Además, el tiempo total dedicado a esta tarea a lo largo de la subasta es o (| i | (| i | + t)). Los límites son en la práctica significativamente más bajos, en función de los resultados en problemas similares de la literatura de razonamiento probabilístico [18]. Uno de los beneficios de la estructura de precios compactos es la representación compacta que presta para las ofertas: los vendedores presentan solo subconsclas y, por lo tanto, el número de ellos enviado y almacenado por vendedor está limitado por | i |. Dado que las tareas de cálculo: bt i = ∅, regla [conmutador] y elección de ηi están involucrando el conjunto BT I, es importante tener en cuenta que su rendimiento solo depende del tamaño del conjunto BT I, ya que todos están subsumidospor la tarea de optimización combinatoria sobre BT I o BT I ∩ Mt. A continuación, analizamos el número de rondas que se necesita para que la subasta termine. La fase B requiere maxi = 1, ... n πt I (ηi) 1. Dado que esto es equivalente a las subastas de solo precios, la preocupación es solo con la complejidad del tiempo de la fase A. Dado que los precios no pueden ir por debajo de FB, r (θr), un límite superior en el número de rondas requeridas es t ≤ x θr∈I (p1 (θr) - fb, r (θr)) G Sin embargo, la fase A puede converger más rápido. Deje que el beneficio negativo inicial elegido por el subastador sea m = maxθ∈θ π1 b (θ). En el peor de los casos, la fase A necesita funcionar hasta ∀θ ∈ θ.πb (θ) = m.Esto sucede, por ejemplo, cuando ∀θr ∈ I.pt (θr) = fb, r (θr) + m g. En general, cuanto más cerca los precios iniciales reflejan la valoración del comprador, más rápida converge la fase A. Un extremo es elegir P1 (θr) = 234 I1 I2 A1 B1 A2 B1 A1 B2 A2 B2 B2 B1 C1 B2 C1 B1 C2 B2 C2 FB 65 50 55 70 50 85 60 75 F1 35 20 30 70 65 65 70 61 F2 35 20 20 2025 25 55 110 70 95 Tabla 1: Funciones de utilidad GAI para el dominio de ejemplo.FB representa la valoración de los compradores, y los costos de F1 y F2 de los vendedores S1 y S2.FB, R (θr) + M g. Eso haría que la fase sea redundante, a costa de la revelación inicial completa de la valoración de los compradores como se hace en otros mecanismos que se analizan a continuación. Entre esta opción y el otro extremo, que es ∀α, ˆα ∈ I, P1 (α) = P1 (ˆα) El subastador tiene un rango de opciones para determinar la compensación correcta entre el tiempo de convergencia y la revelación de la información. En el ejemplo a continuación, la elección de un precio inicial más bajo para el dominio de I1 proporciona cierta aceleración al revelar una cantidad inofensiva de información. Otra posible preocupación es el costo de comunicación asociado con el estilo de subasta japonesa. Los vendedores deben enviar sus ofertas una y otra vez en cada ronda. Se puede hacer un cambio simple para evitar gran parte de la comunicación redundante: la subasta puede retener las sub-perches de rondas anteriores en subfiguraciones cuyo precio no cambió. Dado que las combinaciones de subconscientes de diferentes rondas pueden producir configuraciones subóptimas, cada sub-licitación debe etiquetarse con el número de la última ronda en la que se envió, y solo las combinaciones consistentes de la misma ronda se consideran ofertas completas.. Con esta implementación, los vendedores no necesitan volver a presentar su oferta hasta que un precio de al menos una subfiguración haya cambiado.5.6 Ejemplo Usamos la configuración de ejemplo introducida en la Sección 5.2. Recuerde que la estructura gai es i1 = {a, b}, i2 = {b, c} (tenga en cuenta que e = 1). La Tabla 1 muestra las utilidades GAI para el comprador y los dos vendedores S1, S2. La asignación eficiente es (S1, A1 B2 C1) con un excedente de 45. El excedente máximo del segundo best seller, S2, es 25, logrado por A1 B1 C1, A2 B1 C1 y A2 B2 C2. Establecemos todos los precios iniciales en I1 a 75, y todos los precios iniciales sobre I2 a 90. Establecimos = 8, lo que significa que la reducción de precios para las subconfiguraciones es 4. Aunque con estos números no está garantizado por el Teorema 17, esperamos que S1 gane en la asignación eficiente o en A1 B2 C2 que proporciona un excedente de 39. La razón es que estas son las únicas dos configuraciones que están dentro (e + 1) = 16 de ser eficientes para S1 (por lo tanto, una de ellas debe ser elegida por la fase A), y ambas proporcionan más que excedentes sobre la configuración más eficiente de S2S (y esto es suficiente para ganar en la fase B). La Tabla 2 muestra el progreso de la fase A. Inicialmente, toda la configuración tiene el mismo costo (165), por lo que los vendedores ofertan por su configuración de costo más bajo, que es A2 B1 C1 para ambos (con ganancias 80 a S1 y 90 a S2), y eso se traduce en subconestiles en A2 B1 y B1c1. M1 contiene las subconfiguraciones A2 B2 y B2 C1 de la configuración de valor más alto A2 B2 C1. Por lo tanto, el precio disminuye en A2 B1 y B1 C1. Después del cambio de precio, S1 tiene mayores ganancias (74) en A1 B2 C2 y, por lo tanto, oferta en A1 B2 y B2 C2. Ahora (la ronda 2) sus precios bajan, reduciendo la ganancia en A1 B2 C2 a 66 y, por lo tanto, en la Ronda 3 S1 prefiere A2 B1 C2 (ganancia 67). Después del siguiente precio, el cambio de precio, las configuraciones A1 B2 C1 y A1 B2 C2 se vuelven óptimas (ganancias 66), y las subbidas A1 B2, B2 C1 y B2 C2 capturan los dos. Estas configuraciones se mantienen óptimas para otra ronda (5), con ganancias 62. En este punto, S1 tiene una oferta completa (de hecho, dos ofertas completas: A1 B2 C2 y A1 B2 C1) en M5 e I1 I2 T A1B1 A2B1 A1B2 A2B2 B1C1 B2C1 B1C2 B2C2 1 75 75 75 75 90 90 90 90 S1, S2∗ S1, S2 ∗ 2 75 71 75 75 86 90 90 90 S2 S1 ∗ S2 ∗ S1 3 75 67 71 75 82 90 90 86 S1, S2 ∗ S2 ∗ S1 ∗ 4 75 63 71 75 78 90 86 86 S2 S1 ∗∗, S1 ∗, S1 5 75 59 67 75 74 90 86 86 S2 ∗, S1 ∗ S2 ∗, S1 ∗, S1 6 71 59 67 75 70 90 86 86 S2 ∗, S1 ∗ ∗, S1 S2 ∗, S1 7 7155 67 75 70 90 82 86 S2 ∗, S1 ∗ S2 ∗, S1 ∗, S1 8 67 55 67 75 66 90 82 86 ∗ S2 ∗, S1 ∗ ∗ ∗, S1 S2 ∗, S1 9 67 51 67 75 66 90 78 7886 ∗, S2 ∗, S1 ∗ ∗, S2 ∗, S1 ∗, S1 Tabla 2: Progresión de subastas en la fase A. Vender ofertas y designación de MT (usando ∗) se muestran por debajo del precio de cada subconfiguración.Por lo tanto, ya no cambia sus ofertas ya que el precio de sus configuraciones óptimas no disminuye.S2 se adhiere a A2 B1 C1 durante las primeras cuatro rondas, cambiando a A1 B1 C1 en la ronda 5. Se necesitan cuatro rondas más para que S2 y MT converjan (M10 ∩B10 2 = {A1 B1 C1}). Después de la ronda 9, la subasta establece η1 = A1 B2 C1 (que produce más ganancias del comprador que A1 B2 C2) y η2 = A1 B1 C1. Para la siguiente ronda (10) δ = 8, aumentó en 8 para cada ronda posterior. Tenga en cuenta que P9 (A1 B1 C1) = 133 y C2 (A1 B1 C1) = 90, por lo tanto πt 2 (η2) = 43. En la ronda 15, δ = 48 que significa p15 (A1 B1 C1) = 85 y eso hace que S2 abandone, estableciendo la asignación final a (S1, A1 B2 C1) y P15 (A1 B2 C1) = 157 - 48 = 109. Eso deja al comprador con una ganancia de 31 y S1 con una ganancia de 14, menos que por debajo del beneficio de VCG 20. El bienestar logrado en este caso es óptimo. Para ilustrar cómo podría ocurrir alguna pérdida de eficiencia, considere el caso de que C1 (B2 C2) = 60. En ese caso, en la Ronda 3, la configuración A1 B2 C2 proporciona el mismo beneficio (67) que A2 B1 C2, y S1 ofrece ofertas en ambos. Si bien A2 B1 C2 ya no es óptimo después del cambio de precio, A1 B2 C2 sigue siendo óptimo en las rondas posteriores porque B2 C2 ∈ MT, y el cambio de precio de A1 B2 afecta tanto a A1 B2 C2 como a la configuración eficiente A1 B2 C1. Cuando la fase A finaliza B10 1 ∩ M10 = {A1 B2 C2}, por lo que la subasta termina con la configuración ligeramente subóptima y el excedente 40. 6. Discusión 6.1 Suposiciones preferenciales Un aspecto clave en la implementación de subastas basadas en GAI es la elección de la estructura de preferencias, es decir, los elementos {i1 ,..., Yo G}. En algunos dominios, la estructura puede ser más o menos robusta con el tiempo y en los diferentes tomadores de decisiones. Cuando este no es el caso, extraer una estructura confiable de los vendedores (en forma de condiciones de CDI) es un desafío serio. Esto podría haber sido un factor decisivo para tales dominios, pero de hecho se puede superar. Resulta que podemos ejecutar esta subasta sin suposiciones sobre la estructura de preferencias de los vendedores. El único lugar donde se usa esta suposición en nuestro análisis es para Lemma 8. Si los vendedores cuya estructura de preferencia no está de acuerdo con la utilizada por la subasta se guía a enviar solo una oferta completa en cada ronda, o un conjunto de ofertas que no producen combinaciones consistentes no deseadas, todas las propiedades de la subasta 235 aún se mantienen. A nivel local, los vendedores pueden optimizar sus funciones de ganancias utilizando la unión de su estructura GAI con la estructura de subastas. Por lo tanto, es esencial solo que la estructura de preferencia de los compradores se modele con precisión. Por supuesto, la captura de estructuras de los vendedores también se prefiere ya que puede acelerar la ejecución y permitir que los vendedores aprovechen la representación de oferta compacta. En ambos casos, la elección de los grupos puede afectar significativamente la complejidad de la estructura de precios y el tiempo de ejecución de la subasta. A veces es mejor ignorar algunas interdependencias más débiles para reducir la dimensionalidad. La complejidad de la estructura también afecta la eficiencia de la subasta a través del valor de e.6.2 Propiedades de revelación de información Al considerar las propiedades de información de este mecanismo, comparamos con el enfoque estándar para las subastas iterativas de títulos múltiples, que se basan en los fundamentos teóricos de Che [7]. En la mayoría de estos mecanismos, el comprador revela una función de puntuación y luego el mecanismo solicita ofertas de los vendedores [3, 22, 8, 21] (los mecanismos sugeridos por Beil y Wein [2] son diferentes ya que los compradores pueden modificar su función de puntuación cada uno.ronda, pero el objetivo allí es maximizar las ganancias de los compradores). Mientras que estos mecanismos de adquisición iterativos tienden a aliviar la carga de la revelación de la información de los vendedores, un gran inconveniente es que la función de servicios públicos de compradores debe revelarse a los vendedores antes de recibir cualquier compromiso. En los mecanismos sugeridos por PK y en nuestra subasta GAI anterior, la información del comprador se revela solo a cambio de compromisos de venta. En particular, los vendedores no aprenden nada (más allá del límite superior de precio inicial, que puede perderse arbitrariamente) sobre la utilidad de las configuraciones para las cuales no se presentó ninguna oferta. Cuando se envíen ofertas para una configuración θ, los vendedores podrían inferir su utilidad en relación con las configuraciones preferidas actuales solo después de que el precio de θ se rinda lo suficiente como para que también sea una configuración preferida.6.3 Conclusiones Proponemos una nueva explotación de la estructura de preferencias en subastas multiattribidas. En lugar de asumir la aditividad total, o ninguna estructura en absoluto, modelamos las preferencias utilizando la descomposición GAI. Desarrollamos un mecanismo de subasta iterativo que depende directamente de la descomposición, y también proporcionamos medios directos para construir la representación a partir de declaraciones relativamente simples de disposición para pagar. Nuestro mecanismo de subasta generaliza el modelado de preferencias de PK, mientras que en esencia retiene sus propiedades de revelación de información. Permite una gama de compensaciones entre la precisión de la representación de preferencias y la complejidad de la estructura de precios y la eficiencia de la subasta, así como las compensaciones entre la revelación de la información de los compradores y el tiempo requerido para la convergencia.7.

        "Generalized Value Decomposition and Structured Multiattribute Auctions Yagil Engel and Michael P. Wellman University of Michigan, Computer Science & Engineering 2260 Hayward St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2121, USA {yagil,wellman}@umich.edu ABSTRACT Multiattribute auction mechanisms generally either remain agnostic about traders preferences, or presume highly restrictive forms, such as full additivity.",
        "Real preferences often exhibit dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify operation of a multiattribute auction.",
        "We develop such a structure using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility representation based on an underlying order over preference differences.",
        "A set of local conditional independence relations over such differences supports a generalized additive preference representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of related attributes.",
        "We introduce an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full space of joint configurations.",
        "When traders preferences are consistent with the auctions generalized additive structure, the mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations, at approximate VCG prices.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors: J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms: Algorithms, Economics 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional, price-only mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal.",
        "Rather than negotiating over a fully defined good or service, a multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified.",
        "For example, a procurement department of a company may use a multiattribute auction to select a supplier of hard drives.",
        "Supplier offers may be evaluated not only over the price they offer, but also over various qualitative attributes such as volume, RPM, access time, latency, transfer rate, and so on.",
        "In addition, suppliers may offer different contract conditions such as warranty, delivery time, and service.",
        "In order to account for traders preferences, the auction mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain of multidimensional configurations.",
        "Constructing and communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some simplified form.",
        "By far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt is the simplest: an additive representation where overall value is a linear combination of values associated with each attribute.",
        "For example, several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions [2, 3, 8, 19] require additive preference representations.",
        "Such additivity reduces the complexity of preference specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes.",
        "In practice, however, interdependencies among natural attributes are quite common.",
        "For example, the buyer may exhibit complementary preferences for size and access time (since the performance effect is more salient if much data is involved), or may view a strong warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings.",
        "Similarly, the sellers production characteristics (such as increasing access time is harder for larger hard drives) can easily violate additivity.",
        "In such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide even a reasonable approximation of real preferences.",
        "On the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some structure.",
        "Our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these properties of preferences in trading mechanisms.",
        "We propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a flexible preference structure.",
        "Our approach is inspired by the design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive preferences, due to Parkes and Kalagnanam (PK) [19].",
        "PK propose two types of iterative auctions: the first (NLD) makes no assumptions about traders preferences, and lets sellers bid on the full multidimensional attribute space.",
        "Because NLD maintains an exponential price structure, it is suitable only for small domains.",
        "The other auction (AD) assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost functions.",
        "It collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single discount term.",
        "The price of a configuration is defined as the sum of the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount.",
        "The auction we propose also supports compact price spaces, albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons.",
        "We employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive independence (GAI), a model flexible enough to accommodate interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence can be limited.",
        "Given its roots in multiattribute utility theory [13], 227 the GAI condition is defined with respect to the expected utility function.",
        "To apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes, therefore, requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty.",
        "To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.",
        "We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.",
        "That is, we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference in price.",
        "Next, we build a direct, formally justified link from preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive decomposition of the wtp function.",
        "After laying out this infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to express their complex preferences in GAI format.",
        "We then study the auctions allocational, computational, and practical properties.",
        "In Section 2 we present essential background on our representation framework, the measurable value function (MVF).",
        "Section 3 develops new multiattribute structures for MVF, supporting generalized additive decompositions.",
        "Next, we show the applicability of the theoretical framework to preferences in trading.",
        "The rest of the paper is devoted to the proposed auction mechanism. 2.",
        "MULTIATTRIBUTE PREFERENCES As mentioned, most tools facilitating expression of multiattribute value for trading applications assume that agents preferences can be represented in an additive form.",
        "By way of background, we start by introducing the formal prerequisites justifying the additive representation, as provided by multiattribute utility theory.",
        "We then present the generalized additive form, and develop the formal underpinnings for measurable value needed to extend this model to the case of choice under certainty. 2.1 Preferential Independence Let Θ denote the space of possible outcomes, with a preference relation (weak total order) over Θ.",
        "Let A = {a0, . . . , am} be a set of attributes describing Θ.",
        "Capital letters denote subsets of variables, small letters (with or without numeric subscripts) denote specific variables, and ¯X denotes the complement of X with respect to A.",
        "We indicate specific variable assignments with prime signs or superscripts.",
        "To represent an instantiation of subsets X, Y at the same time we use a sequence of instantiation symbols, as in X Y .",
        "DEFINITION 1.",
        "A set of attributes Y ⊂ A is preferentially independent (PI) of its complement Z = A \\ Y if the conditional preference order over Y given a fixed level Z0 of Z is the same regardless of the choice of Z0 .",
        "In other words, the preference order over the projection of A on the attributes in Y is the same for any instantiation of the attributes in Z.",
        "DEFINITION 2.",
        "A = {a1, . . . , am} is mutually preferentially independent (MPI) if any subset of A is preferentially independent of its complement.",
        "The preference relation when no uncertainty is modeled is usually represented by a value function v [17].",
        "The following fundamental result greatly simplifies the value function representation.",
        "THEOREM 1 ([9]).",
        "A preference order over set of attributes A has an additive value function representation v(a1, . . . , am) = mX i=1 vi(ai) iff A is mutually preferential independent.",
        "Essentially, the additive forms used in trading mechanisms assume mutual preferential independence over the full set of attributes, including the money attribute.",
        "Intuitively that means that willingness to pay for value of an attribute or attributes cannot be affected by the value of other attributes.",
        "A cardinal value function representing an ordering over certain outcomes need not in general coincide with the cardinal utility function that represents preference over lotteries or expected utility (EU).",
        "Nevertheless, EU functions may possess structural properties analogous to that for value functions, such as additive decomposition.",
        "Since the present work does not involve decisions under uncertainty, we do not provide a full exposition of the EU concept.",
        "However we do make frequent reference to the following additive independence relations.",
        "DEFINITION 3.",
        "Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes A. X and Y are conditionally additive independent given Z, denoted as CAI(X, Y | Z), if preferences over lotteries on A depend only on their marginal conditional probability distributions over X and Y .",
        "DEFINITION 4.",
        "Let I1, . . . , Ig ⊆ A such that Sg i=1 Ii = A. I1, . . . , Ig are called generalized additive independent (GAI) if preferences over lotteries on A depend only on their marginal distributions over I1, . . . , Ig.",
        "An (expected) utility function u(·) can be decomposed additively according to its (possibly overlapping) GAI sub-configurations.",
        "THEOREM 2 ([13]).",
        "Let I1, . . . , Ig be GAI.",
        "Then there exist functions f1, . . . , fg such that u(a1, . . . , am) = g X r=1 fr(Ir). (1) What is now known as the GAI condition was originally introduced by Fishburn [13] for EU, and was named GAI and brought to the attention of AI researchers by Bacchus and Grove [1].",
        "Graphical models and elicitation procedures for GAI decomposable utility were developed for EU [4, 14, 6], for a cardinal representation of the ordinal value function [15], and for an ordinal preference relations corresponding to a TCP-net structure by Brafman et al. [5].",
        "Apart from the work on GAI in the context of preference handling that were discussed above, GAI have been recently used in the context of mechanism design by Hyafil and Boutilier [16], as an aid in direct revelation mechanisms.",
        "As shown by Bacchus and Grove [1], GAI structure can be identified based on a set of CAI conditions, which are much easier to detect and verify.",
        "In general, utility functions may exhibit GAI structure not based on CAI.",
        "However, to date all proposals for reasoning and eliciting utility in GAI form take advantage of the GAI structure primarily to the extent that it represents a collection of CAI conditions.",
        "For example, GAI trees [14] employ triangulation of the CAI map, and Braziunas and Boutiliers [6] conditional set Cj of a set Ij corresponds to the CAI separating set of Ij.",
        "Since the CAI condition is also defined based on preferences over lotteries, we cannot apply Bacchus and Groves result without first establishing an alternative framework based on priced outcomes.",
        "We develop such a framework using the theory of measurable value functions, ultimately producing a GAI decomposition 228 (Eq. 1) of the wtp function.",
        "Readers interested primarily in the multiattribute auction and willing to grant the well-foundedness of the preference structure may skip down to Section 5. 2.2 Measurable Value Functions Trading decisions represent a special case of decisions under certainty, where choices involve multiattribute outcomes and corresponding monetary payments.",
        "In such problems, the key decision often hinges on relative valuations of price differences compared to differences in alternative configurations of goods and services.",
        "Theoretically, price can be treated as just another attribute, however, such an approach fails to exploit the special character of the money dimension, and can significantly add to complexity due to the inherent continuity and typical wide range of possible monetary outcome values.",
        "We build on the fundamental work of Dyer and Sarin [10, 11] on measurable value functions (MVFs).",
        "As we show below, wtp functions in a quasi-linear setting can be interpreted as MVFs.",
        "However we first present the MVF framework in a more generic way, where the measurement is not necessarily monetary.",
        "We present the essential definitions and refer to Dyer and Sarin for more detailed background and axiomatic treatment.",
        "The key concept is that of preference difference.",
        "Let θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ Θ such that θ1 θ2 and ϑ1 ϑ2 . [θ2 , θ1 ] denotes the preference difference between θ2 and θ1 , interpreted as the strength, or degree, to which θ2 is preferred over θ1 .",
        "Let ∗ denote a preference order over Θ × Θ.",
        "We interpret the statement [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] as the preference of ϑ2 over ϑ1 is at least as strong as the preference of θ2 over θ1 .",
        "We use the symbol ∼∗ to represent equality of preference differences.",
        "DEFINITION 5. u : D → is a measurable value function (MVF) wrt ∗ if for any θ1 , θ2 , ϑ1 , ϑ2 ∈ D, [θ2 , θ1 ] ∗ [ϑ2 , ϑ1 ] ⇔ u(θ2 ) − u(θ1 ) ≤ u(ϑ2 ) − u(ϑ1 ).",
        "Note that an MVF can also be used as a value function representing , since [θ , θ] ∗ [θ , θ] iff θ θ .",
        "DEFINITION 6 ([11]).",
        "Attribute set X ⊂ A is called difference independent of ¯X if for any two assignments X1 ¯X X2 ¯X , [X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ] ∼∗ [X1 ¯X , X2 ¯X ] for any assignment ¯X .",
        "Or, in words, the preference differences on assignments to X given a fixed level of ¯X do not depend on the particular level chosen for ¯X.",
        "As with additive independence for EU, this condition is stronger than preferential independence of X.",
        "Also analogously to EU, mutual preferential independence combined with other conditions leads to additive decomposition of the MVF.",
        "Moreover, Dyer and Sarin [11] have defined analogs of utility independence [17] for MVF, and worked out a parallel set of decomposition results. 3.",
        "ADVANCED MVF STRUCTURES 3.1 Conditional Difference Independence Our first step is to generalize Definition 6 to a conditional version.",
        "DEFINITION 7.",
        "Let X, Y, Z be a partition of the set of attributes A. X is conditionally difference independent of Y given Z, denoted as CDI(X, Y | Z), if ∀ instantiations ˆZ, X1 , X2 , Y 1 , Y 2 [X1 Y 1 ˆZ, X2 Y 1 ˆZ] ∼ [X1 Y 2 ˆZ, X2 Y 2 ˆZ].",
        "Since the conditional set is always the complement, we sometimes leave it implicit, using the abbreviated notation CDI(X, Y ).",
        "CDI leads to a decomposition similar to that obtained from CAI [17].",
        "LEMMA 3.",
        "Let u(A) be an MVF representing preference differences.",
        "Then CDI(X, Y | Z) iff u(A) = u(X0 , Y, Z) + u(X, Y 0 , Z) − u(X0 , Y 0 , Z).",
        "To complete the analogy with CAI, we generalize Lemma 3 as follows.",
        "PROPOSITION 4.",
        "CDI(X, Y | Z) iff there exist functions ψ1(X, Z) and ψ2(Y, Z), such that u(X, Y, Z) = ψ1(X, Z) + ψ2(Y, Z). (2) An immediate result of Proposition 4 is that CDI is a symmetric relation.",
        "The conditional independence condition is much more applicable than the unconditional one.",
        "For example, if attributes a ∈ X and b /∈ X are complements or substitutes, X cannot be difference independent of ¯X.",
        "However, X \\ {a} may still be CDI of ¯X given a. 3.2 GAI Structure for MVF A single CDI condition decomposes the value function into two parts.",
        "We seek a finer-grain global decomposition of the utility function, similar to that obtained from mutual preferential independence.",
        "For this purpose we are now ready to employ the results of Bacchus and Grove [1], who establish that the CAI condition has a perfect map [20]; that is, there exists a graph whose nodes correspond to the set A, and its node separation reflects exactly the complete set of CAI conditions on A.",
        "Moreover, they show that the utility function decomposes over the set of maximal cliques of the perfect map.",
        "Their proofs can be easily adapted to CDI, since they only rely on the decomposition property of CAI that is also implied by CDI according to Proposition 4.",
        "THEOREM 5.",
        "Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI conditions on A.",
        "Then u(A) = g X r=1 fr(Ir), (3) where I1, . . . , Ig are (overlapping) subsets of A, each corresponding to a maximal clique of G. Given Theorem 5, we can now identify an MVF GAI structure from a collection of CDI conditions.",
        "The CDI conditions, in turn, are particularly intuitive to detect when the preference differences carry a direct interpretation, as in the case with monetary differences discussed below.",
        "Moreover, the assumption or detection of CDI conditions can be performed incrementally, until the MVF is decomposed to a reasonable dimension.",
        "This is in contrast with the fully additive decomposition of MVF that requires mutual preferential independence [11].",
        "Theorem 5 defines a decomposition structure, but to represent the actual MVF we need to specify the functions over the cliques. 229 The next theorem establishes that the functional constituents of MVF are the same as those for GAI decompositions as defined by Fishburn [13] for EU.",
        "We adopt the following conventional notation.",
        "Let (a0 1, . . . , a0 m) be a predefined vector called the reference outcome.",
        "For any I ⊆ A, the function u([I]) stands for the projection of u(A) to I where the rest of the attributes are fixed at their reference levels.",
        "THEOREM 6.",
        "Let G = (A, E) be a perfect map for the CDI condition on A, and {I1, . . . , Ig} a set of maximal cliques as defined in Theorem 5.",
        "Then the functional decomposition from that theorem can be defined as f1 = u([I1]), and for r = 2, . . . , g (4) fr = u([Ir]) + r−1X k=1 (−1)k X 1≤i1<···<ik<r u([ k\\ s=1 Iis ∩ Ir]) The proof directly shows that if graph G = (A, E) is a perfect map of CDI, u(A) decomposes to a sum over the functions defined in (4).1 Thus this proof does not rely on the decomposition result of Theorem 5, only on the existence of the perfect map.",
        "To summarize, the results of this section generalize additive MVF theory.",
        "In particular it justifies the application of methods recently developed under the EU framework [1, 4, 14, 6] to representation of value under certainty. 4.",
        "WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY AS AN MVF 4.1 Construction In this section we apply measurable value to represent differences of willingness to pay for outcomes.",
        "We assume that the agent has a preference order over outcome space, represented by a set of attributes A, and an attribute p representing monetary consequence.",
        "Note that in evaluating a purchase decision, p would correspond to the agents money holdings net of the transaction (i.e., wealth after purchase), not the purchase price.",
        "An outcome in this space is represented for example by (θ , p ), where θ is an instantiation of A and p is a value of p. We further assume that preferences are quasi-linear in p, that is there exists a value function of the form v(A, p) = u(A) + L(p), where L is a positive linear function.2 The quasi-linear form immediately qualifies money as a measure of preference differences, and establishes a monetary scale for u(A).",
        "DEFINITION 8.",
        "Let v(A, p) = u(A)+L(p) represent , where p is the attribute representing money.",
        "We call u(A) a willingnessto-pay (wtp) function.",
        "Note that wtp may also refer to the sellers willingness to accept function.",
        "The wtp u(A) is a cardinal function, unique up to a positive linear transformation.",
        "Since (θ1, p ) (θ2, p ) ⇔ u(θ1) − u(θ2) ≤ L(p − p ), (where θ1, θ1 ∈ Θ, the domain of A) the wtp function can be used to choose among priced outcomes. 1 This proof and most other proofs in this paper are omitted for space consideration, and are available in an online appendix. 2 In many procurement applications, the deals in question are small relative to the enterprises involved, so the quasi-linearity assumption is warranted.",
        "This assumption can be relaxed to a condition called corresponding tradeoffs [17], which does not require the value over money to be linear.",
        "To simplify the presentation, however, we maintain the stronger assumption.",
        "Naturally, elicitation of wtp function is most intuitive when using direct monetary values.",
        "In other words, we elicit a function in which L(p) = p, so v(A, p) = u(A) + p. We define a reference outcome (θ0 , p0 ), and assuming continuity of p, for any assignment ˆθ there exists a ˆp such that (ˆθ, ˆp) ∼ (θ0 , p0 ).",
        "As v is normalized such that v(θ0 , p0 ) = 0, ˆp is interpreted as the wtp for ˆθ, or the reserve price of ˆθ.",
        "PROPOSITION 7.",

        "We note that the wtp function is used extensively in economics, and that all the development in Section 3 could be performed directly in terms of wtp, relying on quasi-linearity for preference measurement, and without formalization using MVFs.",
        "This formalization however aligns this work with the fundamental difference independence theory by Dyer and Sarin.",
        "In addition to facilitating the detection of GAI structure, the CDI condition supports elicitation using local queries, similar to how CAI is used by Braziunas and Boutilier [6].",
        "We adopt their definition of conditional set of Ir, noted here Sr, as the set of neighbors of attributes in Ir not including the attributes of Ir.",
        "Clearly, Sr is the separating set of Ir in the CDI map, hence CDI(Ir, Vr), where Vr = A \\ (Ir ∪ Sr).",
        "From the definition of CDI, for any V 1 r , V 2 r we have: u(I1 r S0 r V 1 r ) − u(I2 r S0 r V 1 r ) = u(I1 r S0 r V 2 r ) − u(I2 r S0 r V 2 r ).",
        "Eliciting the wtp function therefore amounts to eliciting the utility (wtp) of one full outcome (the reference outcome θ0 ), and then obtaining the function over each maximal clique using monetary differences between its possible assignments (technique known as pricing out [17]), keeping the variables in the conditional set fixed.",
        "These ceteris paribus elicitation queries are local in the sense that the agent does not need to consider the values of the rest of the attributes.",
        "Furthermore, in eliciting MVFs we can avoid the global scaling step that is required for EU functions.",
        "Since the preference differences are extracted with respect to specific amounts of the attribute p, the utility is already scaled according to that external measure.",
        "Hence, once the conditional utility functions u([Ij]) are obtained, we can calculate u(A) according to (4).",
        "This last step may require (in the worst case) computation of a number of terms that is exponential in the number of max cliques.",
        "In practice however we do not expect the intersection of the cliques to go that deep; intersection of more than just a few max cliques would normally be empty.",
        "To take advantage of that we can use the search algorithm suggested by Braziunas and Boutilier [6], which efficiently finds all the nonempty intersections for each clique. 4.2 Optimization As shown, the wtp function can be used directly for pairwise comparisons of priced outcomes.",
        "Another preference query often treated in the literature is optimization, or choice of best outcome, possibly under constraints.",
        "Typical decisions about exchange of a good or service exhibit what we call first-order preferential independence (FOPI), under which most or all single attributes have a natural ordering of quality, independent of the values of the rest.3 For example, when choosing a PC we always prefer more memory, faster CPU, longer warranty, and so on.",
        "Under FOPI, the unconstrained optimization of 3 This should not be mistaken with the highly demanding condition of mutual preferential independence, that requires all tradeoffs between attributes to be independent. 230 unpriced outcomes is trivial, hence we consider choice among attribute points with prices.",
        "Since any outcome can be best given enough monetary compensation, this problem is not well-defined unless the combinations are constrained somehow.",
        "A particularly interesting optimization problem arises in the context of negotiation, where we consider the utility of both buyers and sellers.",
        "The multiattribute matching problem (MMP) [12] is concerned with finding an attribute point that maximizes the surplus of a trade, or the difference between the utilities of the buyer and the seller, ub(A) − us(A).",

        "When payment is guaranteed to be δ-VCG sellers can only affect their payment within that range, therefore their gain by falsely reporting their cost is bounded by 2δ.",
        "LEMMA 18.",
        "When sellers are SB, the payment in the end of GAI auction is sell-side (e + 2) -VCG.",
        "THEOREM 19.",
        "SB is an (3e + 5) ex-post Nash Equilibrium for sellers in GAI auction.",
        "That is, sellers cannot gain more than (3e + 5) by deviating.",
        "In practice, however, sellers are unlikely to have the information that would let them exploit that potential gain.",
        "They are much more likely to lose from bidding on their less attractive configurations. 5.5 Computation and Complexity The size of the price space maintained in the auction is equal to the total number of sub-configurations, meaning it is exponential in maxr |Ir|.",
        "This is also equivalent to the tree-width (plus one) of the original CDI-map.",
        "For the purpose of the computational analysis let dj denote the domain of attribute aj, and I = Sg r=1 Q j∈Ir dj, the collection of all sub-configurations.",
        "The first purpose of this sub-section is to show that the complexity of all the computations required for the auction depends only on |I|, i.e., no computation depends on the size of the full exponential domain.",
        "We are first concerned with the computation of Mt .",
        "Since Mt grows monotonically with t, a naive application of optimization algorithm to generate the best outcomes sequentially might end up enumerating significant portions of the fully exponential domain.",
        "However as shown below this plain enumeration can be avoided.",
        "PROPOSITION 20.",
        "The computation of Mt can be done in time O(|I|2 ).",
        "Moreover, the total time spent on this task throughout the auction is O(|I|(|I| + T)).",
        "The bounds are in practice significantly lower, based on results on similar problems from the probabilistic reasoning literature [18].",
        "One of the benefits of the compact pricing structure is the compact representation it lends for bids: sellers submit only sub-bids, and therefore the number of them submitted and stored per seller is bounded by |I|.",
        "Since the computation tasks: Bt i = ∅, rule [SWITCH] and choice of ηi are all involving the set Bt i , it is important to note that their performance only depend on the size of the set Bt i , since they are all subsumed by the combinatorial optimization task over Bt i or Bt i ∩ Mt .",
        "Next, we analyze the number of rounds it takes for the auction to terminate.",
        "Phase B requires maxi=1,...n πT i (ηi)1 .",
        "Since this is equivalent to price-only auctions, the concern is only with the time complexity of phase A.",
        "Since prices cannot go below fb,r(θr), an upper bound on the number of rounds required is T ≤ X θr∈I (p1 (θr) − fb,r(θr)) g However phase A may converge faster.",
        "Let the initial negative profit chosen by the auctioneer be m = maxθ∈Θ π1 b (θ).",
        "In the worst case phase A needs to run until ∀θ ∈ Θ.πb(θ) = m. This happens for example when ∀θr ∈ I.pt (θr) = fb,r(θr) + m g .",
        "In general, the closer the initial prices reflect buyer valuation, the faster phase A converges.",
        "One extreme is to choose p1 (θr) = 234 I1 I2 a1 b1 a2 b1 a1 b2 a2 b2 b1 c1 b2 c1 b1 c2 b2 c2 fb 65 50 55 70 50 85 60 75 f1 35 20 30 70 65 65 70 61 f2 35 20 25 25 55 110 70 95 Table 1: GAI utility functions for the example domain. fb represents the buyers valuation, and f1 and f2 costs of the sellers s1 and s2. fb,r(θr) + m g .",
        "That would make phase A redundant, at the cost of full initial revelation of buyers valuation as done in other mechanisms discussed below.",
        "Between this option and the other extreme, which is ∀α, ˆα ∈ I, p1 (α) = p1 (ˆα) the auctioneer has a range of choices to determine the right tradeoff between convergence time and information revelation.",
        "In the example below the choice of a lower initial price for the domain of I1 provides some speedup by revealing a harmless amount of information.",
        "Another potential concern is the communication cost associated with the Japanese auction style.",
        "The sellers need to send their bids over and over again at each round.",
        "A simple change can be made to avoid much of the redundant communication: the auction can retain sub-bids from previous rounds on sub-configurations whose price did not change.",
        "Since combinations of sub-bids from different rounds can yield sub-optimal configurations, each sub-bid should be tagged with the number of the latest round in which it was submitted, and only consistent combinations from the same round are considered to be full bids.",
        "With this implementation sellers need not resubmit their bid until a price of at least one sub-configuration has changed. 5.6 Example We use the example settings introduced in Section 5.2.",
        "Recall that the GAI structure is I1 = {a, b}, I2 = {b, c} (note that e = 1).",
        "Table 1 shows the GAI utilities for the buyer and the two sellers s1, s2.",
        "The efficient allocation is (s1, a1 b2 c1 ) with a surplus of 45.",
        "The maximal surplus of the second best seller, s2, is 25, achieved by a1 b1 c1 , a2 b1 c1 , and a2 b2 c2 .",
        "We set all initial prices over I1 to 75, and all initial prices over I2 to 90.",
        "We set = 8, meaning that price reduction for sub-configurations is 4.",
        "Though with these numbers it is not guaranteed by Theorem 17, we expect s1 to win on either the efficient allocation or on a1 b2 c2 which provides a surplus of 39.",
        "The reason is that these are the only two configurations which are within (e + 1) = 16 of being efficient for s1 (therefore one of them must be chosen by Phase A), and both provide more than surplus over s2s most efficient configuration (and this is sufficient in order to win in Phase B).",
        "Table 2 shows the progress of phase A.",
        "Initially all configuration have the same cost (165), so sellers bid on their lowest cost configuration which is a2 b1 c1 for both (with profit 80 to s1 and 90 to s2), and that translates to sub-bids on a2 b1 and b1 c1 .",
        "M1 contains the sub-configurations a2 b2 and b2 c1 of the highest value configuration a2 b2 c1 .",
        "Price is therefore decreased on a2 b1 and b1 c1 .",
        "After the price change, s1 has higher profit (74) on a1 b2 c2 and she therefore bids on a1 b2 and b2 c2 .",
        "Now (round 2) their prices go down, reducing the profit on a1 b2 c2 to 66 and therefore in round 3 s1 prefers a2 b1 c2 (profit 67).",
        "After the next price change the configurations a1 b2 c1 and a1 b2 c2 both become optimal (profit 66), and the subbids a1 b2 , b2 c1 and b2 c2 capture the two.",
        "These configurations stay optimal for another round (5), with profit 62.",

        "It takes four more rounds for s2 and Mt to converge (M10 ∩B10 2 = {a1 b1 c1 }).",
        "After round 9 the auction sets η1 = a1 b2 c1 (which yields more buyer profit than a1 b2 c2 ) and η2 = a1 b1 c1 .",

        "Note that p9 (a1 b1 c1 ) = 133, and c2(a1 b1 c1 ) = 90, therefore πT 2 (η2) = 43.",

        "When phase A ends B10 1 ∩ M10 = {a1 b2 c2 } so the auction terminates with the slightly suboptimal configuration and surplus 40. 6.",
        "DISCUSSION 6.1 Preferential Assumptions A key aspect in implementing GAI based auctions is the choice of the preference structure, that is, the elements {I1, . . . , Ig}.",
        "In some domains the structure can be more or less robust over time and over different decision makers.",
        "When this is not the case, extracting reliable structure from sellers (in the form of CDI conditions) is a serious challenge.",
        "This could have been a deal breaker for such domains, but in fact it can be overcome.",
        "It turns out that we can run this auction without any assumptions on sellers preference structure.",
        "The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8.",
        "If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the auction 235 still hold.",
        "Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure.",
        "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
        "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
        "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.",
        "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
        "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
        "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
        "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
        "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
        "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
        "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
        "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
        "We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
        "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
        "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8.",
                "If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the <br>auction</br> are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the <br>auction</br> 235 still hold.",
                "Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure.",
                "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
                "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
                "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the <br>auction</br>.",
                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
                "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the <br>auction</br> through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI <br>auction</br> above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an iterative <br>auction</br> mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our <br>auction</br> mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the <br>auction</br>, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "Real preferences often exhibit dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify operation of a <br>multiattribute auction</br>.",
                "We develop such a structure using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility representation based on an underlying order over preference differences.",
                "A set of local conditional independence relations over such differences supports a generalized additive preference representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of related attributes.",
                "We introduce an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full space of joint configurations.",
                "When traders preferences are consistent with the auctions generalized additive structure, the mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations, at approximate VCG prices.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors: J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms: Algorithms, Economics 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Multiattribute trading mechanisms extend traditional, price-only mechanisms by facilitating the negotiation over a set of predefined attributes representing various non-price aspects of the deal.",
                "Rather than negotiating over a fully defined good or service, a multiattribute mechanism delays commitment to specific configurations until the most promising candidates are identified.",
                "For example, a procurement department of a company may use a <br>multiattribute auction</br> to select a supplier of hard drives.",
                "Supplier offers may be evaluated not only over the price they offer, but also over various qualitative attributes such as volume, RPM, access time, latency, transfer rate, and so on.",
                "In addition, suppliers may offer different contract conditions such as warranty, delivery time, and service.",
                "In order to account for traders preferences, the auction mechanism must extract evaluative information over a complex domain of multidimensional configurations.",
                "Constructing and communicating a complete preference specification can be a severe burden for even a moderate number of attributes, therefore practical multiattribute auctions must either accommodate partial specifications, or support compact expression of preferences assuming some simplified form.",
                "By far the most popular multiattribute form to adopt is the simplest: an additive representation where overall value is a linear combination of values associated with each attribute.",
                "For example, several recent proposals for iterative multiattribute auctions [2, 3, 8, 19] require additive preference representations.",
                "Such additivity reduces the complexity of preference specification exponentially (compared to the general discrete case), but precludes expression of any interdependencies among the attributes.",
                "In practice, however, interdependencies among natural attributes are quite common.",
                "For example, the buyer may exhibit complementary preferences for size and access time (since the performance effect is more salient if much data is involved), or may view a strong warranty as a good substitute for high reliability ratings.",
                "Similarly, the sellers production characteristics (such as increasing access time is harder for larger hard drives) can easily violate additivity.",
                "In such cases an additive value function may not be able to provide even a reasonable approximation of real preferences.",
                "On the other hand, fully general models are intractable, and it is reasonable to expect multiattribute preferences to exhibit some structure.",
                "Our goal, therefore, is to identify the subtler yet more widely applicable structured representations, and exploit these properties of preferences in trading mechanisms.",
                "We propose an iterative auction mechanism based on just such a flexible preference structure.",
                "Our approach is inspired by the design of an iterative multiattribute procurement auction for additive preferences, due to Parkes and Kalagnanam (PK) [19].",
                "PK propose two types of iterative auctions: the first (NLD) makes no assumptions about traders preferences, and lets sellers bid on the full multidimensional attribute space.",
                "Because NLD maintains an exponential price structure, it is suitable only for small domains.",
                "The other auction (AD) assumes additive buyer valuation and seller cost functions.",
                "It collects sell bids per attribute level and for a single discount term.",
                "The price of a configuration is defined as the sum of the prices of the chosen attribute levels minus the discount.",
                "The auction we propose also supports compact price spaces, albeit for levels of clusters of attributes rather than singletons.",
                "We employ a preference decomposition based on generalized additive independence (GAI), a model flexible enough to accommodate interdependencies to the exact degree of accuracy desired, yet providing a compact functional form to the extent that interdependence can be limited.",
                "Given its roots in multiattribute utility theory [13], 227 the GAI condition is defined with respect to the expected utility function.",
                "To apply it for modeling values for certain outcomes, therefore, requires a reinterpretation for preference under certainty.",
                "To this end, we exploit the fact that auction outcomes are associated with continuous prices, which provide a natural scale for assessing magnitude of preference.",
                "We first lay out a representation framework for preferences that captures, in addition to simple orderings among attribute configuration values, the difference in the willingness to pay (wtp) for each.",
                "That is, we should be able not only to compare outcomes but also decide whether the difference in quality is worth a given difference in price.",
                "Next, we build a direct, formally justified link from preference statements over priced outcomes to a generalized additive decomposition of the wtp function.",
                "After laying out this infrastructure, we employ this representation tool for the development of a multiattribute iterative auction mechanism that allows traders to express their complex preferences in GAI format.",
                "We then study the auctions allocational, computational, and practical properties.",
                "In Section 2 we present essential background on our representation framework, the measurable value function (MVF).",
                "Section 3 develops new multiattribute structures for MVF, supporting generalized additive decompositions.",

                "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
                "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
                "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.",
                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
                "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",

                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",

                "The computation of Mt can be done in time O(|I|2 ).",

                "One of the benefits of the compact pricing structure is the compact representation it lends for bids: sellers submit only sub-bids, and therefore the number of them submitted and stored per seller is bounded by |I|.",
                "Since the computation tasks: Bt i = ∅, rule [SWITCH] and choice of ηi are all involving the set Bt i , it is important to note that their performance only depend on the size of the set Bt i , since they are all subsumed by the combinatorial optimization task over Bt i or Bt i ∩ Mt .",

                "Between this option and the other extreme, which is ∀α, ˆα ∈ I, p1 (α) = p1 (ˆα) the auctioneer has a range of choices to determine the right tradeoff between convergence time and information revelation.",

                "Since combinations of sub-bids from different rounds can yield sub-optimal configurations, each sub-bid should be tagged with the number of the latest round in which it was submitted, and only consistent combinations from the same round are considered to be full bids.",

                "Table 2 shows the progress of phase A.",
                "Initially all configuration have the same cost (165), so sellers bid on their lowest cost configuration which is a2 b1 c1 for both (with profit 80 to s1 and 90 to s2), and that translates to sub-bids on a2 b1 and b1 c1 .",

                "The only place where this assumption is used in our analysis is for Lemma 8.",
                "If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the auction 235 still hold.",
                "Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure.",
                "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
                "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
                "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.",
                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
                "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure.",
                "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
                "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
                "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.",
                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
                "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "If sellers whose preference structure does not agree with the one used by the auction are guided to submit only one full bid at each round, or a set of bids that does not yield undesired consistent combinations, all the properties of the auction 235 still hold.",
                "Locally, the sellers can optimize their profit functions using the union of their GAI structure with the auctions structure.",
                "It is therefore essential only that the buyers preference structure is accurately modeled.",
                "Of course, capturing sellers structures as well is still preferred since it can speed up the execution and let sellers take advantage of the compact bid representation.",
                "In both cases the choice of clusters may significantly affect the complexity of the price structure and the runtime of the auction.",
                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",
                "The complexity of the structure also affects the efficiency of the auction through the value of e. 6.2 Information Revelation Properties In considering information properties of this mechanism we compare to the standard approach for iterative multiattribute auctions, which is based on the theoretical foundations of Che [7].",
                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "It is sometimes better to ignore some weaker interdependencies in order to reduce dimensionality.",

                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an <br>iterative auction mechanism</br> directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "In most of these mechanisms the buyer reveals a scoring function and then the mechanism solicits bids from the sellers [3, 22, 8, 21] (the mechanisms suggested by Beil and Wein [2] is different since buyers can modify their scoring function each round, but the goal there is to maximize the buyers profit).",
                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",

                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",

                "Whereas these iterative procurement mechanisms tend to relieve the burden of information revelation from the sellers, a major drawback is that the buyers utility function must be revealed to the sellers before receiving any commitment.",
                "In the mechanisms suggested by PK and in our GAI auction above, buyer information is revealed only in exchange for sell commitments.",
                "In particular, sellers learn nothing (beyond the initial price upper bound, which can be arbitrarily loose) about the utility of configurations for which no bid was submitted.",
                "When bids are submitted for a configuration θ, sellers would be able to infer its utility relative to the current preferred configurations only after the price of θ is driven down sufficiently to make it a preferred configuration as well. 6.3 Conclusions We propose a novel exploitation of preference structure in multiattribute auctions.",
                "Rather than assuming full additivity, or no structure at all, we model preferences using the GAI decomposition.",
                "We developed an iterative auction mechanism directly relying on the decomposition, and also provided direct means of constructing the representation from relatively simple statements of willingnessto-pay.",
                "Our auction mechanism generalizes PKs preference modeling, while in essence retaining their information revelation properties.",
                "It allows for a range of tradeoffs between accuracy of preference representation and both the complexity of the pricing structure and efficiency of the auction, as well as tradeoffs between buyers information revelation and the time required for convergence. 7.",
