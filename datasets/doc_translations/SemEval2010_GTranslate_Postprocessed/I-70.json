Our system named Dynamo is designed along this domain but following an original approach based on an adaptive multi-agent architecture. In this paper we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, core of our approach. It is evaluated and compared to a more conventional centralized algorithm. We also present how it has been improved using a multi-criteria approach. With those results in mind, we discuss the limits of our system and add as perspectives the modifications required to reach a complete ontology building solution.

INTRODUCTION Nowadays, it is well established that ontologies are needed for semantic web, knowledge management, B2B... For knowledge management, ontologies are used to annotate documents and to enhance the information retrieval. But building an ontology manually is a slow, tedious, costly, complex and time consuming process. Currently, a real challenge lies in building them automatically or semi-automatically and keeping them up to date. It would mean creating dynamic ontologies [10] and it justifies the emergence of ontology learning techniques [14] [13]. Our research focuses on Dynamo (an acronym of DYNAMic Ontologies), a tool based on an adaptive multi-agent system to construct and maintain an ontology from a domain specific set of texts. Our aim is not to build an exhaustive, general hierarchical ontology but a domain specific one. We propose a semi-automated tool since an external resource is required: the ontologist. An ontologist is a kind of cognitive engineer, or analyst, who is using information from texts and expert interviews to design ontologies. In the multi-agent field, ontologies generally enable agents to understand each other [12]. Theyre sometimes used to ease the ontology building process, in particular for collaborative contexts [3], but they rarely represent the ontology itself [16]. Most works interested in the construction of ontologies [7] propose the refinement of ontologies. This process consists in using an existing ontology and building a new one from it. This approach is different from our approach because Dynamo starts from scratch. Researchers, working on the construction of ontologies from texts, claim that the work to be automated requires external resources such as a dictionary [14], or web access [5]. In our work, we propose an interaction between the ontologist and the system, our external resource lies both in the texts and the ontologist. This paper first presents, in section 2, the big picture of the Dynamo system. In particular the motives that led to its creation and its general architecture. Then, in section 3 we discuss the distributed clustering algorithm used in Dynamo and compare it to a more classic centralized approach. Section 4 is dedicated to some enhancement of the agents behavior that got designed by taking into account criteria ignored by clustering. And finally, in section 5, we discuss the limitations of our approach and explain how it will be addressed in further work. 2. DYNAMO OVERVIEW 2.1 Ontology as a Multi-Agent System Dynamo aims at reducing the need for manual actions in processing the text analysis results and at suggesting a concept network kick-off in order to build ontologies more efficiently. The chosen approach is completely original to our knowledge and uses an adaptive multi-agent system. This choice comes from the qualities offered by multi-agent system: they can ease the interactive design of a system [8] (in our case, a conceptual network), they allow its incremental building by progressively taking into account new data (coming from text analysis and user interaction), and last but not least they can be easily distributed across a computer network. Dynamo takes a syntactical and terminological analysis of texts as input. It uses several criteria based on statistics computed from the linguistic contexts of terms to create and position the concepts. As output, Dynamo provides to the analyst a hierarchical organization of concepts (the multi-agent system itself) that can be validated, refined of modified, until he/she obtains a satisfying state of 1286 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the semantic network. An ontology can be seen as a stable map constituted of conceptual entities, represented here by agents, linked by labelled relations. Thus, our approach considers an ontology as a type of equilibrium between its concept-agents where their forces are defined by their potential relationships. The ontology modification is a perturbation of the previous equilibrium by the appearance or disappearance of agents or relationships. In this way, a dynamic ontology is a self-organizing process occurring when new texts are included into the corpus, or when the ontologist interacts with it. To support the needed flexibility of such a system we use a selforganizing multi-agent system based on a cooperative approach [9]. We followed the ADELFE method [4] proposed to drive the design of this kind of multi-agent system. It justifies how we designed some of the rules used by our agents in order to maximize the cooperation degree within Dynamos multi-agent system. 2.2 Proposed Architecture In this section, we present our system architecture. It addresses the needs of Knowledge Engineering in the context of dynamic ontology management and maintenance when the ontology is linked to a document collection. The Dynamo system consists of three parts (cf. figure 1): • a term network, obtained thanks to a term extraction tool used to preprocess the textual corpus, • a multi-agent system which uses the term network to make a hierarchical clustering in order to obtain a taxonomy of concepts, • an interface allowing the ontologist to visualize and control the clustering process. ?? Ontologist Interface System Concept Agent Term Term network Terms Extraction Tool Figure 1: System architecture The term extractor we use is Syntex, a software that has efficiently been used for ontology building tasks [11]. We mainly selected it because of its robustness and the great amount of information extracted. In particular, it creates a Head-Expansion network which has already proven to be interesting for a clustering system [1]. In such a network, each term is linked to its head term1 and 1 i.e. the maximum sub-phrase located as head of the term its expansion term2 , and also to all the terms for which it is a head or an expansion term. For example, knowledge engineering from text has knowledge engineering as head term and text as expansion term. Moreover, knowledge engineering is composed of knowledge as head term and engineering as expansion term. With Dynamo, the term network obtained as the output of the extractor is stored in a database. For each term pair, we assume that it is possible to compute a similarity value in order to make a clustering [6] [1]. Because of the nature of the data, we are only focusing on similarity computation between objects described thanks to binary variables, that means that each item is described by the presence or absence of a characteristic set [15]. In the case of terms we are generally dealing with their usage contexts. With Syntex, those contexts are identified by terms and characterized by some syntactic relations. The Dynamo multi-agent system implements the distributed clustering algorithm described in detail in section 3 and the rules described in section 4. It is designed to be both the system producing the resulting structure and the structure itself. It means that each agent represent a class in the taxonomy. Then, the system output is the organization obtained from the interaction between agents, while taking into account feedback coming from the ontologist when he/she modifies the taxonomy given his needs or expertise. 3. DISTRIBUTED CLUSTERING This section presents the distributed clustering algorithm used in Dynamo. For the sake of understanding, and because of its evaluation in section 3.1, we recall the basic centralized algorithm used for a hierarchical ascending clustering in a non metric space, when a symmetrical similarity measure is available [15] (which is the case of the measures used in our system). Algorithm 1: Centralized hierarchical ascending clustering algorithm Data: List L of items to organize as a hierarchy Result: Root R of the hierarchy while length(L) > 1 do max ← 0; A ← nil; B ← nil; for i ← 1 to length(L) do I ← L[i]; for j ← i + 1 to length(L) do J ← L[j]; sim ← similarity(I, J); if sim > max then max ← sim; A ← I; B ← J; end end end remove(A, L); remove(B, L); append((A, B), L); end R ← L[1]; In algorithm 1, for each clustering step, the pair of the most similar elements is determined. Those two elements are grouped in a cluster, and the resulting class is appended to the list of remaining elements. This algorithm stops when the list has only one element left. 2 i.e. the maximum sub-phrase located as tail of the term The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1287 The hierarchy resulting from algorithm 1 is always a binary tree because of the way grouping is done. Moreover grouping the most similar elements is equivalent to moving them away from the least similar ones. Our distributed algorithm is designed relying on those two facts. It is executed concurrently in each of the agents of the system. Note that, in the following of this paper, we used for both algorithms an Anderberg similarity (with α = 0.75) and an average link clustering strategy [15]. Those choices have an impact on the resulting tree, but they impact neither the global execution of the algorithm nor its complexity. We now present the distributed algorithm used in our system. It is bootstrapped in the following way: • a TOP agent having no parent is created, it will be the root of the resulting taxonomy, • an agent is created for each term to be positioned in the taxonomy, they all have TOP as parent. Once this basic structure is set, the algorithm runs until it reaches equilibrium and then provides the resulting taxonomy. Ak−1 Ak AnA2A1 P ...... ...... A1 Figure 2: Distributed classification: Step 1 The process first step (figure 2) is triggered when an agent (here Ak) has more than one brother (since we want to obtain a binary tree). Then it sends a message to its parent P indicating its most dissimilar brother (here A1). Then P receives the same kind of message from each of its children. In the following, this kind of message will be called a vote. Ak−1 Ak AnA2A1 P P ...... ...... P P Figure 3: Distributed clustering: Step 2 Next, when P has got messages from all its children, it starts the second step (figure 3). Thanks to the received messages indicating the preferences of its children, P can determine three sub-groups among its children: • the child which got the most votes by its brothers, that is the child being the most dissimilar from the greatest number of its brothers. In case of a draw, one of the winners is chosen randomly (here A1), • the children that allowed the election of the first group, that is the agents which chose their brother of the first group as being the most dissimilar one (here Ak to An), • the remaining children (here A2 to Ak−1). Then P creates a new agent P (having P as parent) and asks agents from the second group (here agents Ak to An) to make it their new parent. Ak−1 Ak AnA2A1 P P ...... ...... Figure 4: Distributed clustering: Step 3 Finally, step 3 (figure 4) is trivial. The children rejected by P (here agent A2 to An) take its message into account and choose P as their new parent. The hierarchy just created a new intermediate level. Note that this algorithm generally converges, since the number of brothers of an agent drops. When an agent has only one remaining brother, its activity stops (although it keeps processing messages coming from its children). However in a few cases we can reach a circular conflict in the voting procedure when for example A votes against B, B against C and C against A. With the current system no decision can be taken. The current procedure should be improved to address this, probably using a ranked voting method. 3.1 Quantitative Evaluation Now, we evaluate the properties of our distributed algorithm. It requires to begin with a quantitative evaluation, based on its complexity, while comparing it with the algorithm 1 from the previous section. Its theoretical complexity is calculated for the worst case, by considering the similarity computation operation as elementary. For the distributed algorithm, the worst case means that for each run, only a two-item group can be created. Under those conditions, for a given dataset of n items, we can determine the amount of similarity computations. For algorithm 1, we note l = length(L), then the most enclosed for loop is run l − i times. And its body has the only similarity computation, so its cost is l−i. The second for loop is ran l times for i ranging from 1 to l. Then its cost is Pl i=1(l − i) which can be simplified in l×(l−1) 2 . Finally for each run of the while loop, l is decreased from n to 1 which gives us t1(n) as the amount of similarity computations for algorithm 1: t1(n) = nX l=1 l × (l − 1) 2 (1) For the distributed algorithm, at a given step, each one of the l agents evaluates the similarity with its l −1 brothers. So each steps has a l × (l − 1) cost. Then, groups are created and another vote occurs with l decreased by one (since we assume worst case, only groups of size 2 or l −1 are built). Since l is equal to n on first run, we obtain tdist(n) as the amount of similarity computations for the distributed algorithm: tdist(n) = nX l=1 l × (l − 1) (2) Both algorithms then have an O(n3 ) complexity. But in the worst case, the distributed algorithm does twice the number of el1288 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ementary operations done by the centralized algorithm. This gap comes from the local decision making in each agent. Because of this, the similarity computations are done twice for each agent pair. We could conceive that an agent sends its computation result to its peer. But, it would simply move the problem by generating more communication in the system. 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Amountofcomparisons Amount of input terms 1. Distributed algorithm (on average, with min and max) 2. Logarithmic polynomial 3. Centralized algorithm Figure 5: Experimental results In a second step, the average complexity of the algorithm has been determined by experiments. The multi-agent system has been executed with randomly generated input data sets ranging from ten to one hundred terms. The given value is the average of comparisons made for one hundred of runs without any user interaction. It results in the plots of figure 5. The algorithm is then more efficient on average than the centralized algorithm, and its average complexity is below the worst case. It can be explained by the low probability that a data set forces the system to create only minimal groups (two items) or maximal (n − 1 elements) for each step of reasoning. Curve number 2 represents the logarithmic polynomial minimizing the error with curve number 1. The highest degree term of this polynomial is in n2 log(n), then our distributed algorithm has a O(n2 log(n)) complexity on average. Finally, lets note the reduced variation of the average performances with the maximum and the minimum. In the worst case for 100 terms, the variation is of 1,960.75 for an average of 40,550.10 (around 5%) which shows the good stability of the system. 3.2 Qualitative Evaluation Although the quantitative results are interesting, the real advantage of this approach comes from more qualitative characteristics that we will present in this section. All are advantages obtained thanks to the use of an adaptive multi-agent system. The main advantage to the use of a multi-agent system for a clustering task is to introduce dynamic in such a system. The ontologist can make modifications and the hierarchy adapts depending on the request. It is particularly interesting in a knowledge engineering context. Indeed, the hierarchy created by the system is meant to be modified by the ontologist since it is the result of a statistic computation. During the necessary look at the texts to examine the usage contexts of terms [2], the ontologist will be able to interpret the real content and to revise the system proposal. It is extremely difficult to realize this with a centralized black-box approach. In most cases, one has to find which reasoning step generated the error and to manually modify the resulting class. Unfortunately, in this case, all the reasoning steps that occurred after the creation of the modified class are lost and must be recalculated by taking the modification into account. That is why a system like ASIUM [6] tries to soften the problem with a system-user collaboration by showing to the ontologist the created classes after each step of reasoning. But, the ontologist can make a mistake, and become aware of it too late. Figure 6: Concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system In order to illustrate our claims, we present an example thanks to a few screenshots from the working prototype tested on a medical related corpus. By using test data and letting the system work by itself, we obtain the hierarchy from figure 6 after stabilization. It is clear that the concept described by the term lésion (lesion) is misplaced. It happens that the similarity computations place it closer to femme (woman) and chirurgien (surgeon) than to infection, gastro-entérite (gastro-enteritis) and hépatite (hepatitis). This wrong position for lesion is explained by the fact that without ontologist input the reasoning is only done on statistics criteria. Figure 7: Concept agent tree after ontologist modification Then, the ontologist replaces the concept in the right branch, by affecting ConceptAgent:8 as its new parent. The name ConceptAgent:X is automatically given to a concept agent that is not described by a term. The system reacts by itself and refines the clustering hierarchy to obtain a binary tree by creating ConceptAgent:11. The new stable state if the one of figure 7. This system-user coupling is necessary to build an ontology, but no particular adjustment to the distributed algorithm principle is needed since each agent does an autonomous local processing and communicates with its neighborhood by messages. Moreover, this algorithm can de facto be distributed on a computer network. The communication between agents is then done by sending messages and each one keeps its decision autonomy. Then, a system modification to make it run networked would not require to adjust the algorithm. On the contrary, it would only require to rework the communication layer and the agent creation process since in our current implementation those are not networked. 4. MULTI-CRITERIA HIERARCHY In the previous sections, we assumed that similarity can be computed for any term pair. But, as soon as one uses real data this property is not verified anymore. Some terms do not have any similarity value with any extracted term. Moreover for leaf nodes it is sometimes interesting to use other means to position them in the hierarchy. For this low level structuring, ontologists generally base The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1289 their choices on simple heuristics. Using this observation, we built a new set of rules, which are not based on similarity to support low level structuring. 4.1 Adding Head Coverage Rules In this case, agents can act with a very local point of view simply by looking at the parent/child relation. Each agent can try to determine if its parent is adequate. It is possible to guess this because each concept agent is described by a set of terms and thanks to the Head-Expansion term network. In the following TX will be the set of terms describing concept agent X and head(TX ) the set of all the terms that are head of at least one element of TX . Thanks to those two notations we can describe the parent adequacy function a(P, C) between a parent P and a child C: a(P, C) = |TP ∩ head(TC )| |TP ∪ head(TC )| (3) Then, the best parent for C is the P agent that maximizes a(P, C). An agent unsatisfied by its parent can then try to find a better one by evaluating adequacy with candidates. We designed a complementary algorithm to drive this search: When an agent C is unsatisfied by its parent P, it evaluates a(Bi, C) with all its brothers (noted Bi) the one maximizing a(Bi, C) is then chosen as the new parent. Figure 8: Concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system without head coverage rule We now illustrate this rule behavior with an example. Figure 8 shows the state of the system after stabilization on test data. We can notice that hépatite viral (viral hepatitis) is still linked to the taxonomy root. It is caused by the fact that there is no similarity value between the viral hepatitis term and any of the term of the other concept agents. Figure 9: Concept agent tree after activation of the head coverage rule After activating the head coverage rule and letting the system stabilize again we obtain figure 9. We can see that viral hepatitis slipped through the branch leading to hepatitis and chose it as its new parent. It is a sensible default choice since viral hepatitis is a more specific term than hepatitis. This rule tends to push agents described by a set of term to become leafs of the concept tree. It addresses our concern to improve the low level structuring of our taxonomy. But obviously our agents lack a way to backtrack in case of modifications in the taxonomy which would make them be located in the wrong branch. That is one of the point where our system still has to be improved by adding another set of rules. 4.2 On Using Several Criteria In the previous sections and examples, we only used one algorithm at a time. The distributed clustering algorithm tends to introduce new layers in the taxonomy, while the head coverage algorithm tends to push some of the agents toward the leafs of the taxonomy. It obviously raises the question on how to deal with multiple criteria in our taxonomy building, and how agents determine their priorities at a given time. The solution we chose came from the search for minimizing non cooperation within the system in accordance with the ADELFE method. Each agent computes three non cooperation degrees and chooses its current priority depending on which degree is the highest. For a given agent A having a parent P, a set of brothers Bi and which received a set of messages Mk having the priority pk the three non cooperation degrees are: • μH (A) = 1 − a(P, A), is the head coverage non cooperation degree, determined by the head coverage of the parent, • μB(A) = max(1 − similarity(A, Bi)), is the brotherhood non cooperation degree, determined by the worst brother of A regarding similarities, • μM (A) = max(pk), is the message non cooperation degree, determined by the most urgent message received. Then, the non cooperation degree μ(A) of agent A is: μ(A) = max(μH (A), μB(A), μM (A)) (4) Then, we have three cases determining which kind of action A will choose: • if μ(A) = μH (A) then A will use the head coverage algorithm we detailed in the previous subsection • if μ(A) = μB(A) then A will use the distributed clustering algorithm (see section 3) • if μ(A) = μM (A) then A will process Mk immediately in order to help its sender Those three cases summarize the current activities of our agents: they have to find the best parent for them (μ(A) = μH (A)), improve the structuring through clustering (μ(A) = μB(A)) and process other agent messages (μ(A) = μM (A)) in order to help them fulfill their own goals. 4.3 Experimental Complexity Revisited We evaluated the experimental complexity of the whole multiagent system when all the rules are activated. In this case, the metric used is the number of messages exchanged in the system. Once again the system has been executed with input data sets ranging from ten to one hundred terms. The given value is the average of message amount sent in the system as a whole for one hundred runs without user interaction. It results in the plots of figure 10. Curve number 1 represents the average of the value obtained. Curve number 2 represents the average of the value obtained when only the distributed clustering algorithm is activated, not the full rule set. Curve number 3 represents the polynomial minimizing the error with curve number 1. The highest degree term of this polynomial is in n3 , then our multi-agent system has a O(n3 ) complexity 1290 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Amountofmessages Amount of input terms 1. Dynamo, all rules (on average, with min and max) 2. Distributed clustering only (on average) 2. Cubic polynomial Figure 10: Experimental results on average. Moreover, lets note the very small variation of the average performances with the maximum and the minimum. In the worst case for 100 terms, the variation is of 126.73 for an average of 20,737.03 (around 0.6%) which proves the excellent stability of the system. Finally the extra head coverage rules are a real improvement on the distributed algorithm alone. They introduce more constraints and stability point is reached with less interactions and decision making by the agents. It means that less messages are exchanged in the system while obtaining a tree of higher quality for the ontologist. 5. DISCUSSION & PERSPECTIVES 5.1 Current Limitation of our Approach The most important limitation of our current algorithm is that the result depends on the order the data gets added. When the system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization, the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a centralized algorithm. On the contrary, adding a new item after a first stabilization has an impact on the final result. Figure 11: Concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system To illustrate our claims, we present another example of the working system. By using test data and letting the system work by itself, we obtain the hierarchy of figure 11 after stabilization. Figure 12: Concept agent tree after taking in account hepatitis Then, the ontologist interacts with the system and adds a new concept described by the term hepatitis and linked to the root. The system reacts and stabilizes, we then obtain figure 12 as a result. hepatitis is located in the right branch, but we have not obtained the same organization as the figure 6 of the previous example. We need to improve our distributed algorithm to allow a concept to move along a branch. We are currently working on the required rules, but the comparison with centralized algorithm will become very difficult. In particular since they will take into account criteria ignored by the centralized algorithm. 5.2 Pruning for Ontologies Building In section 3, we presented the distributed clustering algorithm used in the Dynamo system. Since this work was first based on this algorithm, it introduced a clear bias toward binary trees as a result. But we have to keep in mind that we are trying to obtain taxonomies which are more refined and concise. Although the head coverage rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the intermediate levels of the tree. By looking at figure 7, it is clear that some pruning could be done in the taxonomy. In particular, since lésion moved, ConceptAgent:9 could be removed, it is not needed anymore. Moreover the branch starting with ConceptAgent:8 clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form. In this case ConceptAgent:10 and ConceptAgent:11 could probably be merged. Currently, our system has the necessary rules to create intermediate levels in the taxonomy, or to have concepts shifting towards the leaf. As we pointed, it is not enough, so new rules are needed to allow removing nodes from the tree, or move them toward the root. Most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist. 6. CONCLUSION After being presented as a promising solution, ensuring model quality and their terminological richness, ontology building from textual corpus analysis is difficult and costly. It requires analyst supervising and taking in account the ontology aim. Using natural languages processing tools ease the knowledge localization in texts through language uses. That said, those tools produce a huge amount of lexical or grammatical data which is not trivial to examine in order to define conceptual elements. Our contribution lies in this step of the modeling process from texts, before any attempts to normalize or formalize the result. We proposed an approach based on an adaptive multi-agent system to provide the ontologist with a first taxonomic structure of concepts. Our system makes use of a terminological network resulting from an analysis made by Syntex. The current state of our software allows to produce simple structures, to propose them to the ontologist and to make them evolve depending on the modifications he made. Performances of the system are interesting and some aspects are even comparable to their centralized counterpart. Its strengths are mostly qualitative since it allows more subtle user interactions and a progressive adaptation to new linguistic based information. From the point of view of ontology building, this work is a first step showing the relevance of our approach. It must continue, both to ensure a better robustness during classification, and to obtain richer structures semantic wise than simple trees. From this improvements we are mostly focusing on the pruning to obtain better taxonomies. Were currently working on the criterion to trigger the complementary actions of the structure changes applied by our clustering algorithm. In other words this algorithm introduces inThe Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1291 termediate levels, and we need to be able to remove them if necessary, in order to reach a dynamic equilibrium. Also from the multi-agent engineering point of view, their use in a dynamic ontology context has shown its relevance. This dynamic ontologies can be seen as complex problem solving, in such a case self-organization through cooperation has been an efficient solution. And, more generally its likely to be interesting for other design related tasks, even if were focusing only on knowledge engineering in this paper. Of course, our system still requires more evaluation and validation work to accurately determine the advantages and flaws of this approach. Were planning to work on such benchmarking in the near future. 7. REFERENCES [1] H. Assadi. Construction of a regional ontology from text and its use within a documentary system.

En este artículo presentamos un algoritmo de agrupamiento jerárquico distribuido, núcleo de nuestro enfoque. Se evalúa y se compara con un algoritmo centralizado más convencional. También presentamos cómo se ha mejorado utilizando un enfoque de criterios múltiples. Con esos resultados en mente, discutimos los límites de nuestro sistema y agregamos como perspectivas las modificaciones requeridas para alcanzar una solución completa de construcción de ontología.

Introducción Hoy en día, está bien establecido que las ontologías son necesarias para la web semántica, la gestión del conocimiento, B2B ... Para la gestión del conocimiento, las ontologías se utilizan para anotar documentos y mejorar la recuperación de la información. Pero construir una ontología manualmente es un proceso lento, tedioso, costoso, complejo y lento. Actualmente, un verdadero desafío radica en construirlos de forma automática o semiautomática y mantenerlos actualizados. Significaría crear ontologías dinámicas [10] y justifica la aparición de técnicas de aprendizaje ontología [14] [13]. Nuestra investigación se centra en Dynamo (un acrónimo de ontologías dinámicas), una herramienta basada en un sistema adaptativo de múltiples agentes para construir y mantener una ontología a partir de un conjunto de textos específicos de dominio. Nuestro objetivo no es construir una ontología jerárquica general exhaustiva, sino específica de dominio. Proponemos una herramienta semiautomatizada ya que se requiere un recurso externo: el oncólogo. Un oncólogo es una especie de ingeniero cognitivo o analista, que está utilizando información de textos y entrevistas expertas para diseñar ontologías. En el campo de múltiples agentes, las ontologías generalmente permiten que los agentes se entiendan entre sí [12]. A veces se usan para aliviar el proceso de construcción de ontología, en particular para contextos colaborativos [3], pero rara vez representan la ontología misma [16]. La mayoría de las obras interesadas en la construcción de ontologías [7] proponen el refinamiento de las ontologías. Este proceso consiste en usar una ontología existente y construir una nueva de él. Este enfoque es diferente de nuestro enfoque porque Dynamo comienza desde cero. Los investigadores, que trabajan en la construcción de ontologías a partir de textos, afirman que el trabajo a ser automatizado requiere recursos externos como un diccionario [14] o acceso web [5]. En nuestro trabajo, proponemos una interacción entre el oncólogo y el sistema, nuestro recurso externo se encuentra tanto en los textos como en el oncólogo. Este artículo presenta primero, en la Sección 2, el panorama general del sistema Dynamo. En particular los motivos que llevaron a su creación y a su arquitectura general. Luego, en la Sección 3 discutimos el algoritmo de agrupación distribuido utilizado en Dynamo y lo comparamos con un enfoque centralizado más clásico. La Sección 4 está dedicada a alguna mejora del comportamiento de los agentes que se diseñó teniendo en cuenta los criterios ignorados por la agrupación. Y finalmente, en la Sección 5, discutimos las limitaciones de nuestro enfoque y explicamos cómo se abordará en trabajos adicionales.2. Dynamo Overview 2.1 Ontology como un sistema de múltiples agentes Dynamo tiene como objetivo reducir la necesidad de acciones manuales en el procesamiento de los resultados del análisis de texto y sugerir un inicio de la red conceptual para construir ontologías de manera más eficiente. El enfoque elegido es completamente original de nuestro conocimiento y utiliza un sistema adaptativo de agente múltiple. Esta elección proviene de las cualidades ofrecidas por el sistema de múltiples agentes: pueden aliviar el diseño interactivo de un sistema [8] (en nuestro caso, una red conceptual), permiten su construcción incremental teniendo en cuenta progresivamente nuevos datos (provenientes deAnálisis de texto y interacción del usuario), y por último, pero no menos importante, se pueden distribuir fácilmente a través de una red de computadoras. Dynamo toma un análisis sintáctico y terminológico de textos como entrada. Utiliza varios criterios basados en estadísticas calculadas a partir de los contextos lingüísticos de términos para crear y posicionar los conceptos. Como salida, Dynamo proporciona al analista una organización jerárquica de conceptos (el sistema de múltiples agentes) que puede validar, refinado de modificado, hasta que obtenga un estado satisfactorio de 1286 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas The Semantic Network. Una ontología puede verse como un mapa estable constituido por entidades conceptuales, representadas aquí por agentes, vinculados por relaciones etiquetadas. Por lo tanto, nuestro enfoque considera una ontología como un tipo de equilibrio entre sus agentes conceptuales donde sus fuerzas están definidas por sus posibles relaciones. La modificación de la ontología es una perturbación del equilibrio anterior por la apariencia o la desaparición de agentes o relaciones. De esta manera, una ontología dinámica es un proceso autoorganizado que ocurre cuando se incluyen nuevos textos en el corpus, o cuando el oncólogo interactúa con él. Para respaldar la flexibilidad necesaria de dicho sistema, utilizamos un sistema de múltiples agentes de autoorganización basado en un enfoque cooperativo [9]. Seguimos el método Adelfe [4] propuesto para impulsar el diseño de este tipo de sistema de múltiples agentes. Justifica cómo diseñamos algunas de las reglas utilizadas por nuestros agentes para maximizar el grado de cooperación dentro del sistema Dynamos Multi-Agent.2.2 Arquitectura propuesta En esta sección, presentamos nuestra arquitectura del sistema. Aborda las necesidades de la ingeniería del conocimiento en el contexto de la gestión y el mantenimiento de la ontología dinámica cuando la ontología está vinculada a una recopilación de documentos. El sistema Dynamo consta de tres partes (cf. Figura 1): • Una red de término, obtenida gracias a una herramienta de extracción de término utilizada para preprocesar el corpus textual, • Un sistema de agentes múltiples que utiliza la red de términos para hacer una agrupación jerárquica enpara obtener una taxonomía de conceptos, • una interfaz que permite al oncólogo visualizar y controlar el proceso de agrupación.?? Interfaz de ontólogo Sistema Concepto Concept Agente Término Términos Términos de extracción Figura 1: Arquitectura del sistema El término extractor que utilizamos es Syntex, un software que se ha utilizado de manera eficiente para las tareas de construcción de ontología [11]. Lo seleccionamos principalmente debido a su robustez y la gran cantidad de información extraída. En particular, crea una red de expansión principal que ya ha demostrado ser interesante para un sistema de agrupación [1]. En dicha red, cada término está vinculado a su término principal 1 y 1, es decir, la subcrasa máxima ubicada como cabeza del término su término de expansión2, y también a todos los términos para los cuales es una cabeza o un término de expansión. Por ejemplo, la ingeniería de conocimiento del texto tiene ingeniería de conocimiento como término principal y texto como término de expansión. Además, la ingeniería del conocimiento está compuesta de conocimiento como término principal e ingeniería como término de expansión. Con Dynamo, el término red obtenida como la salida del extractor se almacena en una base de datos. Para cada par de términos, suponemos que es posible calcular un valor de similitud para hacer una agrupación [6] [1]. Debido a la naturaleza de los datos, solo nos estamos centrando en el cálculo de similitud entre los objetos descritos gracias a las variables binarias, lo que significa que cada elemento se describe por la presencia o ausencia de un conjunto característico [15]. En el caso de los términos, generalmente estamos tratando con sus contextos de uso. Con Syntex, esos contextos se identifican por términos y se caracterizan por algunas relaciones sintácticas. El sistema Dynamo Multi-Agent implementa el algoritmo de agrupación distribuido descrito en detalle en la Sección 3 y las reglas descritas en la Sección 4. Está diseñado para ser tanto el sistema que produce la estructura resultante como la estructura misma. Significa que cada agente representa una clase en la taxonomía. Luego, la producción del sistema es la organización obtenida de la interacción entre los agentes, mientras que tiene en cuenta la retroalimentación proveniente del ontólogo cuando él/ella modifica la taxonomía dadas sus necesidades o experiencia.3. Agrupación distribuida Esta sección presenta el algoritmo de agrupación distribuido utilizado en Dynamo. En aras de la comprensión, y debido a su evaluación en la Sección 3.1, recordamos el algoritmo centralizado básico utilizado para una agrupación ascendente jerárquica en un espacio no métrico, cuando una medida de similitud simétrica está disponible [15] (que es el caso de lamedidas utilizadas en nuestro sistema). Algoritmo 1: Datos de algoritmo de agrupamiento ascendente jerárquico centralizado: Lista de L de elementos para organizar como un resultado de la jerarquía: raíz R de la jerarquía durante la longitud (l)> 1 do max ← 0;Un ← nulo;B ← nulo;porque i ← 1 a longitud (l) do i ← l [i];para j ← i + 1 a longitud (l) do j ← l [j];sim ← Similitud (I, J);Si sim> max entonces max ← Sim;A ← i;B ← J;final final final eliminar (a, l);eliminar (b, l);append ((a, b), l);End r ← L [1];En el algoritmo 1, para cada paso de agrupación, se determina el par de los elementos más similares. Esos dos elementos se agrupan en un clúster, y la clase resultante se agrega a la lista de elementos restantes. Este algoritmo se detiene cuando la lista solo le queda un elemento.2 es decir, la subcrasa máxima ubicada como cola del término el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1287 La jerarquía resultante del algoritmo 1 siempre es un árbol binario debido a la forma en que se realiza la agrupación. Además, agrupar los elementos más similares es equivalente a alejarlos de los menos similares. Nuestro algoritmo distribuido está diseñado confiando en esos dos hechos. Se ejecuta simultáneamente en cada uno de los agentes del sistema. Tenga en cuenta que, a continuación de este documento, utilizamos para ambos algoritmos una similitud de Anderberg (con α = 0.75) y una estrategia de agrupación de enlace promedio [15]. Esas elecciones tienen un impacto en el árbol resultante, pero no impactan ni la ejecución global del algoritmo ni su complejidad. Ahora presentamos el algoritmo distribuido utilizado en nuestro sistema. Está arrancado de la siguiente manera: • Se crea un agente superior que no tiene padre, será la raíz de la taxonomía resultante, • Se crea un agente para que cada término se coloque en la taxonomía, todos tienen la parte superior como padre. Una vez que se establece esta estructura básica, el algoritmo funciona hasta que alcanza el equilibrio y luego proporciona la taxonomía resultante. Ak - 1 ak ana2a1 p ...... ...... a1 Figura 2: Clasificación distribuida: Paso 1 El primer paso del proceso (Figura 2) se activa cuando un agente (aquí AK) tiene más de un hermano (ya que queremos obtener un árbol binario). Luego envía un mensaje a su padre P que indica a su hermano más diferente (aquí A1). Entonces P recibe el mismo tipo de mensaje de cada uno de sus hijos. A continuación, este tipo de mensaje se llamará voto. AK - 1 AK ANA2A1 P P ...... ...... P P Figura 3: Clustering distribuido: Paso 2 A continuación, cuando P tiene mensajes de todos sus hijos, comienza el segundo paso (Figura 3). Gracias a los mensajes recibidos que indican las preferencias de sus hijos, P puede determinar tres subgrupos entre sus hijos: • El niño que obtuvo la mayor cantidad de votos de sus hermanos, ese es el niño más diferente del mayor número de sus hermanos. En el caso de un empate, uno de los ganadores se elige al azar (aquí A1), • Los niños que permitieron la elección del primer grupo, que son los agentes que eligieron a su hermano del primer grupo como el más diferente (aquíAk a an), • los niños restantes (aquí A2 a AK - 1). Entonces P crea un nuevo agente P (tener P como padre) y pide a los agentes del segundo grupo (aquí los agentes a un) que lo conviertan en su nuevo padre. AK - 1 AK ANA2A1 P P ...... ...... Figura 4: Agrupación distribuida: Paso 3 Finalmente, el paso 3 (Figura 4) es trivial. Los niños rechazados por P (aquí Agente A2 a An) tienen en cuenta su mensaje y eligen P como su nuevo padre. La jerarquía acaba de crear un nuevo nivel intermedio. Tenga en cuenta que este algoritmo generalmente converge, ya que el número de hermanos de un agente cae. Cuando un agente solo tiene un hermano restante, su actividad se detiene (aunque sigue procesando mensajes provenientes de sus hijos). Sin embargo, en algunos casos podemos alcanzar un conflicto circular en el procedimiento de votación cuando, por ejemplo, A vota contra B, B contra C y C contra A. Con el sistema actual no se puede tomar decisión. El procedimiento actual debe mejorarse para abordar esto, probablemente utilizando un método de votación clasificado.3.1 Evaluación cuantitativa Ahora, evaluamos las propiedades de nuestro algoritmo distribuido. Se requiere comenzar con una evaluación cuantitativa, basada en su complejidad, al tiempo que la comparó con el algoritmo 1 de la sección anterior. Su complejidad teórica se calcula para el peor de los casos, considerando la operación de cálculo de similitud como elemental. Para el algoritmo distribuido, el peor caso significa que para cada ejecución, solo se puede crear un grupo de dos ítems. En esas condiciones, para un conjunto de datos dado de N ítems, podemos determinar la cantidad de cálculos de similitud. Para el algoritmo 1, notamos l = longitud (l), entonces el más encerrado para el bucle se ejecuta L - i tiempos. Y su cuerpo tiene el único cálculo de similitud, por lo que su costo es L - I. El segundo para el bucle se ejecuta L. para que varíe de 1 a L.Entonces su costo es PL I = 1 (L - I) que puede simplificarse en L × (L - 1) 2. Finalmente, para cada ejecución del bucle While, L disminuye de N a 1, lo que nos da T1 (n) como la cantidad de cálculos de similitud para el algoritmo 1: t1 (n) = nx l = 1 l × (l - 1) 2(1) Para el algoritmo distribuido, en un paso dado, cada uno de los agentes L evalúa la similitud con sus hermanos L −1. Entonces, cada paso tiene un costo L × (l - 1). Luego, se crean grupos y se produce otro voto con L disminuido en uno (ya que asumimos el peor de los casos, solo se construyen grupos de tamaño 2 o L -1). Dado que L es igual a N en la primera ejecución, obtenemos TDIST (N) como la cantidad de cálculos de similitud para el algoritmo distribuido: TDIST (N) = Nx L = 1 L × (L - 1) (2) Ambos algoritmos tienen luegoUna complejidad O (N3). Pero en el peor de los casos, el algoritmo distribuido hace el doble de El1288 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de agentes múltiples (AAMAS 07) operaciones semematales realizadas por el algoritmo centralizado. Esta brecha proviene de la toma de decisiones locales en cada agente. Debido a esto, los cálculos de similitud se realizan dos veces para cada par de agentes. Podríamos concebir que un agente envía su resultado de cálculo a su par. Pero, simplemente movería el problema generando más comunicación en el sistema.0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 10 20 30 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Cantidad de Comparisons Cantidad de términos de entrada 1. Algoritmo distribuido (en promedio, con Min y Max) 2. Polinomio logarítmico 3. Algoritmo centralizado Figura 5: Resultados experimentales en un segundo paso, la complejidad promedio del algoritmo ha sido determinada por experimentos. El sistema de múltiples agentes se ha ejecutado con conjuntos de datos de entrada generados aleatoriamente que varían de diez a cien términos. El valor dado es el promedio de comparaciones realizadas para cien corridas sin ninguna interacción del usuario. Resulta en los gráficos de la Figura 5. El algoritmo es más eficiente en promedio que el algoritmo centralizado, y su complejidad promedio está por debajo del peor de los casos. Se puede explicar por la baja probabilidad de que un conjunto de datos obliga al sistema a crear solo grupos mínimos (dos elementos) o máximo (elementos n - 1) para cada paso de razonamiento. La curva número 2 representa el polinomio logarítmico minimizando el error con la curva número 1. El término de mayor grado de este polinomio está en N2 log (N), entonces nuestro algoritmo distribuido tiene una complejidad O (N2 log (N)) en promedio. Finalmente, notemos la variación reducida de los rendimientos promedio con el máximo y el mínimo. En el peor de los casos para 100 términos, la variación es de 1.960.75 para un promedio de 40,550.10 (alrededor del 5%) que muestra la buena estabilidad del sistema.3.2 Evaluación cualitativa Aunque los resultados cuantitativos son interesantes, la ventaja real de este enfoque proviene de características más cualitativas que presentaremos en esta sección. Todas las ventajas obtenidas gracias al uso de un sistema adaptativo de agente múltiple. La principal ventaja para el uso de un sistema de múltiples agentes para una tarea de agrupación es introducir dinámica en dicho sistema. El oncólogo puede hacer modificaciones y la jerarquía se adapta según la solicitud. Es particularmente interesante en un contexto de ingeniería de conocimiento. De hecho, la jerarquía creada por el sistema está destinada a ser modificada por el oncólogo ya que es el resultado de un cálculo estadístico. Durante la mirada necesaria a los textos para examinar los contextos de uso de los términos [2], el oncólogo podrá interpretar el contenido real y revisar la propuesta del sistema. Es extremadamente difícil darse cuenta de esto con un enfoque centralizado de caja negra. En la mayoría de los casos, uno tiene que encontrar qué paso de razonamiento generó el error y modificar manualmente la clase resultante. Desafortunadamente, en este caso, todos los pasos de razonamiento que ocurrieron después de la creación de la clase modificada se pierden y deben recalcularse teniendo en cuenta la modificación. Es por eso que un sistema como Asium [6] intenta suavizar el problema con una colaboración del usuario del sistema mostrando al ontólogo las clases creadas después de cada paso de razonamiento. Pero, el oncólogo puede cometer un error y darse cuenta demasiado tarde. Figura 6: Árbol de agente conceptual Después de la estabilización autónoma del sistema para ilustrar nuestras afirmaciones, presentamos un ejemplo gracias a algunas capturas de pantalla del prototipo de trabajo probado en un corpus relacionado con el médico. Al usar datos de prueba y dejar que el sistema funcione solo, obtenemos la jerarquía de la Figura 6 después de la estabilización. Está claro que el concepto descrito por el término lésión (lesión) está fuera de lugar. Sucede que los cálculos de similitud lo colocan más cerca de la mujer (mujer) y Chirurgien (cirujano) que a la infección, gastroentérita (gastroenteritis) y hépatita (hepatitis). Esta posición incorrecta para la lesión se explica por el hecho de que sin el aporte de ontólogo, el razonamiento solo se realiza en los criterios de estadísticas. Figura 7: Árbol de conceptualidad después de la modificación de oncólogo, el oncólogo reemplaza el concepto en la rama correcta, afectando a ConceptAgent: 8 como su nuevo padre. El nombre ConceptAgent: X se da automáticamente a un agente conceptual que no es descrito por un término. El sistema reacciona por sí solo y refina la jerarquía de agrupación para obtener un árbol binario creando conceptagentes: 11. El nuevo estado estable si el de la Figura 7. Este acoplamiento del usuario del sistema es necesario para construir una ontología, pero no se necesita un ajuste particular al principio de algoritmo distribuido, ya que cada agente realiza un procesamiento local autónomo y se comunica con su vecindario por los mensajes. Además, este algoritmo puede distribuirse de facto en una red de computadoras. La comunicación entre los agentes se realiza enviando mensajes y cada uno mantiene su autonomía de decisión. Luego, una modificación del sistema para que se ejecute en red no requeriría ajustar el algoritmo. Por el contrario, solo requeriría reelaborar la capa de comunicación y el proceso de creación de agentes, ya que en nuestra implementación actual no están en red.4. Jerarquía de criterios múltiples En las secciones anteriores, supusimos que se puede calcular la similitud para cualquier par de términos. Pero, tan pronto como uno usa datos reales, esta propiedad ya no está verificada. Algunos términos no tienen ningún valor de similitud con ningún término extraído. Además para los nodos de hoja, a veces es interesante usar otros medios para colocarlos en la jerarquía. Para esta estructuración de bajo nivel, los ontólogos generalmente basan el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1289 sus opciones sobre heurística simple. Usando esta observación, construimos un nuevo conjunto de reglas, que no se basan en la similitud para admitir la estructuración de bajo nivel.4.1 Agregar reglas de cobertura de la cabeza En este caso, los agentes pueden actuar con un punto de vista muy local simplemente observando la relación padre/niño. Cada agente puede intentar determinar si su padre es adecuado. Es posible adivinar esto porque cada agente conceptual se describe mediante un conjunto de términos y gracias a la red de términos de expansión de cabeza. En el siguiente TX habrá el conjunto de términos que describan el Concept Agent X y Head (TX) el conjunto de todos los términos que son jefes de al menos un elemento de TX. Gracias a esas dos anotaciones, podemos describir la función de adecuación principal A (P, C) entre un padre P y un hijo C: A (P, C) = | TP ∩ Cabeza (TC) || TP ∪ Cabeza (TC) |(3) Entonces, el mejor padre para C es el agente P que maximiza A (P, C). Un agente insatisfecho por su padre puede intentar encontrar uno mejor evaluando la adecuación con los candidatos. Diseñamos un algoritmo complementario para impulsar esta búsqueda: cuando un agente C está insatisfecho por su padre P, evalúa A (BI, C) con todos sus hermanos (BI notados) el que maximiza un (bi, c) se elige comoel nuevo padre. Figura 8: Árbol de agente conceptual después de la estabilización autónoma del sistema sin regla de cobertura de la cabeza ahora ilustramos esta regla comportamiento con un ejemplo. La Figura 8 muestra el estado del sistema después de la estabilización en los datos de prueba. Podemos notar que la hépatita viral (hepatitis viral) todavía está vinculada a la raíz de la taxonomía. Es causado por el hecho de que no existe un valor de similitud entre el término de hepatitis viral y ninguno del término de los otros agentes conceptuales. Figura 9: Árbol de agente conceptual después de la activación de la regla de cobertura de la cabeza después de activar la regla de cobertura de la cabeza y dejar que el sistema se estabilice nuevamente, obtenemos la Figura 9. Podemos ver que la hepatitis viral se deslizó a través de la rama que conduce a la hepatitis y la eligió como su nuevo padre. Es una elección de incumplimiento sensible ya que la hepatitis viral es un término más específico que la hepatitis. Esta regla tiende a impulsar a los agentes descritos por un conjunto de términos para convertirse en hojas del árbol conceptual. Aborda nuestra preocupación por mejorar la estructuración de bajo nivel de nuestra taxonomía. Pero obviamente, nuestros agentes carecen de una forma de retroceder en caso de modificaciones en la taxonomía que los haría ubicar en la rama equivocada. Ese es uno de los puntos en el que nuestro sistema aún debe mejorarse al agregar otro conjunto de reglas.4.2 Al usar varios criterios en las secciones y ejemplos anteriores, solo usamos un algoritmo a la vez. El algoritmo de agrupación distribuido tiende a introducir nuevas capas en la taxonomía, mientras que el algoritmo de cobertura de la cabeza tiende a empujar a algunos de los agentes hacia las hojas de la taxonomía. Obviamente, plantea la pregunta sobre cómo lidiar con múltiples criterios en nuestra construcción de taxonomía y cómo los agentes determinan sus prioridades en un momento dado. La solución que elegimos provino de la búsqueda de minimizar la no cooperación dentro del sistema de acuerdo con el método ADELFE. Cada agente calcula tres grados de no cooperación y elige su prioridad actual dependiendo de qué grado sea el más alto. Para un agente determinado a que tiene un padre P, un conjunto de hermanos bi y que recibió un conjunto de mensajes mk que tiene la prioridad PK Los tres grados de no cooperación son: • μH (a) = 1 - a (p, a) esEl grado de no cooperación de cobertura de la cabeza, determinada por la cobertura de la cabeza del padre, • μb (a) = max (1 - similitud (a, bi)), es el grado de no cooperación de la hermandad, determinado por el peor hermano de A con respecto a las similitudes, • μm (a) = max (PK), es el grado de no cooperación de mensaje, determinado por el mensaje más urgente recibido. Luego, el grado de no cooperación μ (a) del agente A es: μ (a) = max (μH (a), μb (a), μm (a)) (4) entonces, tenemos tres casos que determinan qué tipo deAcción A Eligirá: • Si μ (a) = μH (a) entonces A usará el algoritmo de cobertura de la cabeza que detallamos en la subsección anterior • Si μ (a) = μb (a) entonces A usará el algoritmo de agrupación distribuida (Consulte la Sección 3) • Si μ (a) = μm (a) entonces A procesará MK inmediatamente para ayudar a su remitente, esos tres casos resumen las actividades actuales de nuestros agentes: tienen que encontrar el mejor padre para ellos (μ (μ (A) = μH (a)), mejore la estructuración a través de la agrupación (μ (a) = μb (a)) y procese otros mensajes de agente (μ (a) = μm (a)) para ayudarlos a cumplir sus propios objetivos.4.3 Complejidad experimental revisada evaluamos la complejidad experimental de todo el sistema multiagente cuando se activan todas las reglas. En este caso, la métrica utilizada es el número de mensajes intercambiados en el sistema. Una vez más, el sistema se ha ejecutado con conjuntos de datos de entrada que varían de diez a cien términos. El valor dado es el promedio del monto del mensaje enviado en el sistema en su conjunto para cien ejecuciones sin interacción del usuario. Resulta en los gráficos de la Figura 10. La curva número 1 representa el promedio del valor obtenido. La curva número 2 representa el promedio del valor obtenido cuando solo se activa el algoritmo de agrupamiento distribuido, no el conjunto de reglas completa. La curva número 3 representa el polinomio minimizando el error con la curva número 1. El término de mayor grado de este polinomio está en N3, entonces nuestro sistema de múltiples agentes tiene una complejidad O (N3) 1290 la sexta intl.

Dynamo, todas las reglas (en promedio, con Min y Max) 2. Agrupación distribuida solamente (en promedio) 2. Polinomio cúbico Figura 10: Resultados experimentales en promedio. Además, notemos la variación muy pequeña de los rendimientos promedio con el máximo y el mínimo. En el peor de los casos para 100 términos, la variación es de 126.73 para un promedio de 20,737.03 (alrededor del 0.6%), lo que prueba la excelente estabilidad del sistema. Finalmente, las reglas adicionales de cobertura de la cabeza son una mejora real solo en el algoritmo distribuido. Introducen más restricciones y el punto de estabilidad se alcanza con menos interacciones y toma de decisiones por parte de los agentes. Significa que se intercambian menos mensajes en el sistema al tiempo que obtiene un árbol de mayor calidad para el oncólogo.5. Discusión y perspectivas 5.1 Limitación actual de nuestro enfoque La limitación más importante de nuestro algoritmo actual es que el resultado depende del orden que se agregan los datos. Cuando el sistema funciona por sí mismo en un conjunto de datos fijo dado durante la inicialización, el resultado final es equivalente a lo que podríamos obtener con un algoritmo centralizado. Por el contrario, agregar un nuevo elemento después de una primera estabilización tiene un impacto en el resultado final. Figura 11: Árbol de agente conceptual Después de la estabilización autónoma del sistema para ilustrar nuestras afirmaciones, presentamos otro ejemplo del sistema de trabajo. Al usar datos de prueba y dejar que el sistema funcione solo, obtenemos la jerarquía de la Figura 11 después de la estabilización. Figura 12: Árbol de agente conceptual Después de tener en cuenta la hepatitis, el oncólogo interactúa con el sistema y agrega un nuevo concepto descrito por el término hepatitis y vinculado a la raíz. El sistema reacciona y estabiliza, luego obtenemos la Figura 12 como resultado.La hepatitis se encuentra en la rama correcta, pero no hemos obtenido la misma organización que la Figura 6 del ejemplo anterior. Necesitamos mejorar nuestro algoritmo distribuido para permitir que un concepto se mueva a lo largo de una rama. Actualmente estamos trabajando en las reglas requeridas, pero la comparación con el algoritmo centralizado será muy difícil. En particular, ya que tendrán en cuenta los criterios ignorados por el algoritmo centralizado.5.2 poda para la construcción de ontologías en la Sección 3, presentamos el algoritmo de agrupamiento distribuido utilizado en el sistema Dynamo. Dado que este trabajo se basó primero en este algoritmo, como resultado introdujo un sesgo claro hacia los árboles binarios. Pero tenemos que tener en cuenta que estamos tratando de obtener taxonomías que sean más refinadas y concisas. Aunque la regla de cobertura de la cabeza es una mejora porque se basa en cómo los ontólogos generalmente funcionan, solo aborda la estructuración de bajo nivel pero no los niveles intermedios del árbol. Al observar la Figura 7, está claro que se podría hacer una poda en la taxonomía. En particular, desde que Lésion se movió, conceptual: 9 podría eliminarse, ya no es necesario. Además, la rama que comienza con ConceptAgent: 8 respeta claramente la restricción de hacer un árbol binario, pero sería más útil para el usuario en una forma más compacta y significativa. En este caso, conceptual: 10 y conceptual: 11 probablemente podría fusionarse. Actualmente, nuestro sistema tiene las reglas necesarias para crear niveles intermedios en la taxonomía, o para que los conceptos cambien hacia la hoja. Como señalamos, no es suficiente, por lo que se necesitan nuevas reglas para permitir la eliminación de nodos del árbol, o moverlos hacia la raíz. La mayor parte del trabajo necesario para desarrollar esas reglas consiste en encontrar la información estadística relevante que apoyará al oncólogo.6. Conclusión Después de presentarse como una solución prometedora, garantizar la calidad del modelo y su riqueza terminológica, el edificio de la ontología del análisis textual del corpus es difícil y costoso. Requiere supervisar y tener en cuenta el objetivo de la ontología. El uso de herramientas de procesamiento de idiomas naturales alivia la localización de conocimiento en los textos a través de usos del lenguaje. Dicho esto, esas herramientas producen una gran cantidad de datos léxicos o gramaticales que no son triviales de examinar para definir elementos conceptuales. Nuestra contribución radica en este paso del proceso de modelado de los textos, antes de cualquier intento de normalizar o formalizar el resultado. Propusimos un enfoque basado en un sistema de agente múltiple adaptativo para proporcionar al oncólogo una primera estructura taxonómica de conceptos. Nuestro sistema utiliza una red terminológica resultante de un análisis realizado por Syntex. El estado actual de nuestro software permite producir estructuras simples, proponerlas al oncólogo y hacer que evolucionen según las modificaciones que hizo. Las actuaciones del sistema son interesantes y algunos aspectos son incluso comparables a su contraparte centralizada. Sus fortalezas son en su mayoría cualitativas, ya que permite interacciones más sutiles del usuario y una adaptación progresiva a la nueva información basada en lingüística. Desde el punto de vista de la construcción de la ontología, este trabajo es un primer paso que muestra la relevancia de nuestro enfoque. Debe continuar, tanto para garantizar una mejor robustez durante la clasificación como para obtener estructuras más ricas semánticas que los árboles simples. A partir de estas mejoras, en su mayoría nos estamos centrando en la poda de obtener mejores taxonomías. Actualmente estaban trabajando en el criterio para desencadenar las acciones complementarias de los cambios de estructura aplicados por nuestro algoritmo de agrupación. En otras palabras, este algoritmo presenta en el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1291 denominan niveles, y necesitamos poder eliminarlos si es necesario, para alcanzar un equilibrio dinámico. También desde el punto de vista de ingeniería de múltiples agentes, su uso en un contexto dinámico de ontología ha mostrado su relevancia. Estas ontologías dinámicas pueden verse como una resolución de problemas compleja, en tal caso, la autoorganización a través de la cooperación ha sido una solución eficiente. Y, en general, es probable que sea interesante para otras tareas relacionadas con el diseño, incluso si se centraron solo en la ingeniería de conocimiento en este documento. Por supuesto, nuestro sistema aún requiere más trabajo de evaluación y validación para determinar con precisión las ventajas y defectos de este enfoque. Estaban planeando trabajar en dicha evaluación comparativa en el futuro cercano.7. Referencias [1] H. Assadi.

        "Currently, a real challenge lies in building them automatically or semi-automatically and keeping them up to date.",
        "It would mean creating dynamic ontologies [10] and it justifies the emergence of ontology learning techniques [14] [13].",

        "The chosen approach is completely original to our knowledge and uses an adaptive multi-agent system.",
        "This choice comes from the qualities offered by multi-agent system: they can ease the interactive design of a system [8] (in our case, a conceptual network), they allow its incremental building by progressively taking into account new data (coming from text analysis and user interaction), and last but not least they can be easily distributed across a computer network.",
        "Dynamo takes a syntactical and terminological analysis of texts as input.",
        "It uses several criteria based on statistics computed from the linguistic contexts of terms to create and position the concepts.",

        "An ontology can be seen as a stable map constituted of conceptual entities, represented here by agents, linked by labelled relations.",
        "Thus, our approach considers an ontology as a type of equilibrium between its concept-agents where their forces are defined by their potential relationships.",
        "The ontology modification is a perturbation of the previous equilibrium by the appearance or disappearance of agents or relationships.",
        "In this way, a dynamic ontology is a self-organizing process occurring when new texts are included into the corpus, or when the ontologist interacts with it.",
        "To support the needed flexibility of such a system we use a selforganizing multi-agent system based on a cooperative approach [9].",

        "It addresses the needs of Knowledge Engineering in the context of dynamic ontology management and maintenance when the ontology is linked to a document collection.",
        "The Dynamo system consists of three parts (cf. figure 1): • a term network, obtained thanks to a term extraction tool used to preprocess the textual corpus, • a multi-agent system which uses the term network to make a hierarchical clustering in order to obtain a taxonomy of concepts, • an interface allowing the ontologist to visualize and control the clustering process. ? ?",
        "Ontologist Interface System Concept Agent Term Term network Terms Extraction Tool Figure 1: System architecture The term extractor we use is Syntex, a software that has efficiently been used for ontology building tasks [11].",
        "We mainly selected it because of its robustness and the great amount of information extracted.",
        "In particular, it creates a Head-Expansion network which has already proven to be interesting for a clustering system [1].",
        "In such a network, each term is linked to its head term1 and 1 i.e. the maximum sub-phrase located as head of the term its expansion term2 , and also to all the terms for which it is a head or an expansion term.",
        "For example, knowledge engineering from text has knowledge engineering as head term and text as expansion term.",
        "Moreover, knowledge engineering is composed of knowledge as head term and engineering as expansion term.",
        "With Dynamo, the term network obtained as the output of the extractor is stored in a database.",
        "For each term pair, we assume that it is possible to compute a similarity value in order to make a clustering [6] [1].",
        "Because of the nature of the data, we are only focusing on similarity computation between objects described thanks to binary variables, that means that each item is described by the presence or absence of a characteristic set [15].",
        "In the case of terms we are generally dealing with their usage contexts.",
        "With Syntex, those contexts are identified by terms and characterized by some syntactic relations.",
        "The Dynamo multi-agent system implements the distributed clustering algorithm described in detail in section 3 and the rules described in section 4.",
        "It is designed to be both the system producing the resulting structure and the structure itself.",
        "It means that each agent represent a class in the taxonomy.",
        "Then, the system output is the organization obtained from the interaction between agents, while taking into account feedback coming from the ontologist when he/she modifies the taxonomy given his needs or expertise. 3.",
        "DISTRIBUTED CLUSTERING This section presents the distributed clustering algorithm used in Dynamo.",
        "For the sake of understanding, and because of its evaluation in section 3.1, we recall the basic centralized algorithm used for a hierarchical ascending clustering in a non metric space, when a symmetrical similarity measure is available [15] (which is the case of the measures used in our system).",
        "Algorithm 1: Centralized hierarchical ascending clustering algorithm Data: List L of items to organize as a hierarchy Result: Root R of the hierarchy while length(L) > 1 do max ← 0; A ← nil; B ← nil; for i ← 1 to length(L) do I ← L[i]; for j ← i + 1 to length(L) do J ← L[j]; sim ← similarity(I, J); if sim > max then max ← sim; A ← I; B ← J; end end end remove(A, L); remove(B, L); append((A, B), L); end R ← L[1]; In algorithm 1, for each clustering step, the pair of the most similar elements is determined.",
        "Those two elements are grouped in a cluster, and the resulting class is appended to the list of remaining elements.",
        "This algorithm stops when the list has only one element left. 2 i.e. the maximum sub-phrase located as tail of the term The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1287 The hierarchy resulting from algorithm 1 is always a binary tree because of the way grouping is done.",
        "Moreover grouping the most similar elements is equivalent to moving them away from the least similar ones.",
        "Our distributed algorithm is designed relying on those two facts.",
        "It is executed concurrently in each of the agents of the system.",
        "Note that, in the following of this paper, we used for both algorithms an Anderberg similarity (with α = 0.75) and an average link clustering strategy [15].",
        "Those choices have an impact on the resulting tree, but they impact neither the global execution of the algorithm nor its complexity.",
        "We now present the distributed algorithm used in our system.",
        "It is bootstrapped in the following way: • a TOP agent having no parent is created, it will be the root of the resulting taxonomy, • an agent is created for each term to be positioned in the taxonomy, they all have TOP as parent.",
        "Once this basic structure is set, the algorithm runs until it reaches equilibrium and then provides the resulting taxonomy.",

        "Thanks to the received messages indicating the preferences of its children, P can determine three sub-groups among its children: • the child which got the most votes by its brothers, that is the child being the most dissimilar from the greatest number of its brothers.",
        "In case of a draw, one of the winners is chosen randomly (here A1), • the children that allowed the election of the first group, that is the agents which chose their brother of the first group as being the most dissimilar one (here Ak to An), • the remaining children (here A2 to Ak−1).",
        "Then P creates a new agent P (having P as parent) and asks agents from the second group (here agents Ak to An) to make it their new parent.",

        "Figure 4: Distributed clustering: Step 3 Finally, step 3 (figure 4) is trivial.",
        "The children rejected by P (here agent A2 to An) take its message into account and choose P as their new parent.",
        "The hierarchy just created a new intermediate level.",
        "Note that this algorithm generally converges, since the number of brothers of an agent drops.",
        "When an agent has only one remaining brother, its activity stops (although it keeps processing messages coming from its children).",
        "However in a few cases we can reach a circular conflict in the voting procedure when for example A votes against B, B against C and C against A.",
        "With the current system no decision can be taken.",
        "The current procedure should be improved to address this, probably using a ranked voting method. 3.1 Quantitative Evaluation Now, we evaluate the properties of our distributed algorithm.",
        "It requires to begin with a quantitative evaluation, based on its complexity, while comparing it with the algorithm 1 from the previous section.",
        "Its theoretical complexity is calculated for the worst case, by considering the similarity computation operation as elementary.",
        "For the distributed algorithm, the worst case means that for each run, only a two-item group can be created.",
        "Under those conditions, for a given dataset of n items, we can determine the amount of similarity computations.",
        "For algorithm 1, we note l = length(L), then the most enclosed for loop is run l − i times.",
        "And its body has the only similarity computation, so its cost is l−i.",
        "The second for loop is ran l times for i ranging from 1 to l. Then its cost is Pl i=1(l − i) which can be simplified in l×(l−1) 2 .",
        "Finally for each run of the while loop, l is decreased from n to 1 which gives us t1(n) as the amount of similarity computations for algorithm 1: t1(n) = nX l=1 l × (l − 1) 2 (1) For the distributed algorithm, at a given step, each one of the l agents evaluates the similarity with its l −1 brothers.",
        "So each steps has a l × (l − 1) cost.",
        "Then, groups are created and another vote occurs with l decreased by one (since we assume worst case, only groups of size 2 or l −1 are built).",
        "Since l is equal to n on first run, we obtain tdist(n) as the amount of similarity computations for the distributed algorithm: tdist(n) = nX l=1 l × (l − 1) (2) Both algorithms then have an O(n3 ) complexity.",
        "But in the worst case, the distributed algorithm does twice the number of el1288 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ementary operations done by the centralized algorithm.",
        "This gap comes from the local decision making in each agent.",
        "Because of this, the similarity computations are done twice for each agent pair.",
        "We could conceive that an agent sends its computation result to its peer.",
        "But, it would simply move the problem by generating more communication in the system. 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Amountofcomparisons Amount of input terms 1.",

        "The given value is the average of comparisons made for one hundred of runs without any user interaction.",
        "It results in the plots of figure 5.",
        "The algorithm is then more efficient on average than the centralized algorithm, and its average complexity is below the worst case.",
        "It can be explained by the low probability that a data set forces the system to create only minimal groups (two items) or maximal (n − 1 elements) for each step of reasoning.",
        "Curve number 2 represents the logarithmic polynomial minimizing the error with curve number 1.",
        "The highest degree term of this polynomial is in n2 log(n), then our distributed algorithm has a O(n2 log(n)) complexity on average.",
        "Finally, lets note the reduced variation of the average performances with the maximum and the minimum.",
        "In the worst case for 100 terms, the variation is of 1,960.75 for an average of 40,550.10 (around 5%) which shows the good stability of the system. 3.2 Qualitative Evaluation Although the quantitative results are interesting, the real advantage of this approach comes from more qualitative characteristics that we will present in this section.",
        "All are advantages obtained thanks to the use of an adaptive multi-agent system.",
        "The main advantage to the use of a multi-agent system for a clustering task is to introduce dynamic in such a system.",
        "The ontologist can make modifications and the hierarchy adapts depending on the request.",
        "It is particularly interesting in a knowledge engineering context.",
        "Indeed, the hierarchy created by the system is meant to be modified by the ontologist since it is the result of a statistic computation.",
        "During the necessary look at the texts to examine the usage contexts of terms [2], the ontologist will be able to interpret the real content and to revise the system proposal.",
        "It is extremely difficult to realize this with a centralized black-box approach.",
        "In most cases, one has to find which reasoning step generated the error and to manually modify the resulting class.",
        "Unfortunately, in this case, all the reasoning steps that occurred after the creation of the modified class are lost and must be recalculated by taking the modification into account.",
        "That is why a system like ASIUM [6] tries to soften the problem with a system-user collaboration by showing to the ontologist the created classes after each step of reasoning.",
        "But, the ontologist can make a mistake, and become aware of it too late.",
        "Figure 6: Concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system In order to illustrate our claims, we present an example thanks to a few screenshots from the working prototype tested on a medical related corpus.",
        "By using test data and letting the system work by itself, we obtain the hierarchy from figure 6 after stabilization.",
        "It is clear that the concept described by the term lésion (lesion) is misplaced.",
        "It happens that the similarity computations place it closer to femme (woman) and chirurgien (surgeon) than to infection, gastro-entérite (gastro-enteritis) and hépatite (hepatitis).",
        "This wrong position for lesion is explained by the fact that without ontologist input the reasoning is only done on statistics criteria.",
        "Figure 7: Concept agent tree after ontologist modification Then, the ontologist replaces the concept in the right branch, by affecting ConceptAgent:8 as its new parent.",
        "The name ConceptAgent:X is automatically given to a concept agent that is not described by a term.",
        "The system reacts by itself and refines the clustering hierarchy to obtain a binary tree by creating ConceptAgent:11.",
        "The new stable state if the one of figure 7.",
        "This system-user coupling is necessary to build an ontology, but no particular adjustment to the distributed algorithm principle is needed since each agent does an autonomous local processing and communicates with its neighborhood by messages.",
        "Moreover, this algorithm can de facto be distributed on a computer network.",
        "The communication between agents is then done by sending messages and each one keeps its decision autonomy.",
        "Then, a system modification to make it run networked would not require to adjust the algorithm.",
        "On the contrary, it would only require to rework the communication layer and the agent creation process since in our current implementation those are not networked. 4.",
        "MULTI-CRITERIA HIERARCHY In the previous sections, we assumed that similarity can be computed for any term pair.",
        "But, as soon as one uses real data this property is not verified anymore.",
        "Some terms do not have any similarity value with any extracted term.",
        "Moreover for leaf nodes it is sometimes interesting to use other means to position them in the hierarchy.",
        "For this low level structuring, ontologists generally base The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1289 their choices on simple heuristics.",
        "Using this observation, we built a new set of rules, which are not based on similarity to support low level structuring. 4.1 Adding Head Coverage Rules In this case, agents can act with a very local point of view simply by looking at the parent/child relation.",
        "Each agent can try to determine if its parent is adequate.",
        "It is possible to guess this because each concept agent is described by a set of terms and thanks to the Head-Expansion term network.",
        "In the following TX will be the set of terms describing concept agent X and head(TX ) the set of all the terms that are head of at least one element of TX .",
        "Thanks to those two notations we can describe the parent adequacy function a(P, C) between a parent P and a child C: a(P, C) = |TP ∩ head(TC )| |TP ∪ head(TC )| (3) Then, the best parent for C is the P agent that maximizes a(P, C).",
        "An agent unsatisfied by its parent can then try to find a better one by evaluating adequacy with candidates.",
        "We designed a complementary algorithm to drive this search: When an agent C is unsatisfied by its parent P, it evaluates a(Bi, C) with all its brothers (noted Bi) the one maximizing a(Bi, C) is then chosen as the new parent.",
        "Figure 8: Concept agent tree after autonomous stabilization of the system without head coverage rule We now illustrate this rule behavior with an example.",
        "Figure 8 shows the state of the system after stabilization on test data.",
        "We can notice that hépatite viral (viral hepatitis) is still linked to the taxonomy root.",
        "It is caused by the fact that there is no similarity value between the viral hepatitis term and any of the term of the other concept agents.",
        "Figure 9: Concept agent tree after activation of the head coverage rule After activating the head coverage rule and letting the system stabilize again we obtain figure 9.",
        "We can see that viral hepatitis slipped through the branch leading to hepatitis and chose it as its new parent.",
        "It is a sensible default choice since viral hepatitis is a more specific term than hepatitis.",
        "This rule tends to push agents described by a set of term to become leafs of the concept tree.",
        "It addresses our concern to improve the low level structuring of our taxonomy.",
        "But obviously our agents lack a way to backtrack in case of modifications in the taxonomy which would make them be located in the wrong branch.",
        "That is one of the point where our system still has to be improved by adding another set of rules. 4.2 On Using Several Criteria In the previous sections and examples, we only used one algorithm at a time.",
        "The distributed clustering algorithm tends to introduce new layers in the taxonomy, while the head coverage algorithm tends to push some of the agents toward the leafs of the taxonomy.",
        "It obviously raises the question on how to deal with multiple criteria in our taxonomy building, and how agents determine their priorities at a given time.",
        "The solution we chose came from the search for minimizing non cooperation within the system in accordance with the ADELFE method.",
        "Each agent computes three non cooperation degrees and chooses its current priority depending on which degree is the highest.",
        "For a given agent A having a parent P, a set of brothers Bi and which received a set of messages Mk having the priority pk the three non cooperation degrees are: • μH (A) = 1 − a(P, A), is the head coverage non cooperation degree, determined by the head coverage of the parent, • μB(A) = max(1 − similarity(A, Bi)), is the brotherhood non cooperation degree, determined by the worst brother of A regarding similarities, • μM (A) = max(pk), is the message non cooperation degree, determined by the most urgent message received.",
        "Then, the non cooperation degree μ(A) of agent A is: μ(A) = max(μH (A), μB(A), μM (A)) (4) Then, we have three cases determining which kind of action A will choose: • if μ(A) = μH (A) then A will use the head coverage algorithm we detailed in the previous subsection • if μ(A) = μB(A) then A will use the distributed clustering algorithm (see section 3) • if μ(A) = μM (A) then A will process Mk immediately in order to help its sender Those three cases summarize the current activities of our agents: they have to find the best parent for them (μ(A) = μH (A)), improve the structuring through clustering (μ(A) = μB(A)) and process other agent messages (μ(A) = μM (A)) in order to help them fulfill their own goals. 4.3 Experimental Complexity Revisited We evaluated the experimental complexity of the whole multiagent system when all the rules are activated.",
        "In this case, the metric used is the number of messages exchanged in the system.",
        "Once again the system has been executed with input data sets ranging from ten to one hundred terms.",
        "The given value is the average of message amount sent in the system as a whole for one hundred runs without user interaction.",
        "It results in the plots of figure 10.",
        "Curve number 1 represents the average of the value obtained.",

        "When the system works by itself on a fixed data set given during initialization, the final result is equivalent to what we could obtain with a centralized algorithm.",
        "On the contrary, adding a new item after a first stabilization has an impact on the final result.",

        "Since this work was first based on this algorithm, it introduced a clear bias toward binary trees as a result.",
        "But we have to keep in mind that we are trying to obtain taxonomies which are more refined and concise.",
        "Although the head coverage rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the intermediate levels of the tree.",
        "By looking at figure 7, it is clear that some pruning could be done in the taxonomy.",
        "In particular, since lésion moved, ConceptAgent:9 could be removed, it is not needed anymore.",
        "Moreover the branch starting with ConceptAgent:8 clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form.",
        "In this case ConceptAgent:10 and ConceptAgent:11 could probably be merged.",
        "Currently, our system has the necessary rules to create intermediate levels in the taxonomy, or to have concepts shifting towards the leaf.",
        "As we pointed, it is not enough, so new rules are needed to allow removing nodes from the tree, or move them toward the root.",
        "Most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist. 6.",

        "Using natural languages processing tools ease the knowledge localization in texts through language uses.",
        "That said, those tools produce a huge amount of lexical or grammatical data which is not trivial to examine in order to define conceptual elements.",

        "We proposed an approach based on an adaptive multi-agent system to provide the ontologist with a first taxonomic structure of concepts.",
        "Our system makes use of a terminological network resulting from an analysis made by Syntex.",

                "Moreover the branch starting with ConceptAgent:8 clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form.",

                "Moreover the branch starting with ConceptAgent:8 clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form.",

                "The solution we chose came from the search for minimizing non cooperation within the system in accordance with the ADELFE method.",
                "Each agent computes three non cooperation degrees and chooses its current priority depending on which degree is the highest.",
                "For a given agent A having a parent P, a set of brothers Bi and which received a set of messages Mk having the priority pk the three non cooperation degrees are: • μH (A) = 1 − a(P, A), is the head coverage non cooperation degree, determined by the head coverage of the parent, • μB(A) = max(1 − similarity(A, Bi)), is the brotherhood non cooperation degree, determined by the worst brother of A regarding similarities, • μM (A) = max(pk), is the message non cooperation degree, determined by the most urgent message received.",
                "Then, the non cooperation degree μ(A) of agent A is: μ(A) = max(μH (A), μB(A), μM (A)) (4) Then, we have three cases determining which kind of action A will choose: • if μ(A) = μH (A) then A will use the head coverage algorithm we detailed in the previous subsection • if μ(A) = μB(A) then A will use the distributed clustering algorithm (see section 3) • if μ(A) = μM (A) then A will process Mk immediately in order to help its sender Those three cases summarize the current activities of our agents: they have to find the best parent for them (μ(A) = μH (A)), improve the structuring through clustering (μ(A) = μB(A)) and process other agent messages (μ(A) = μM (A)) in order to help them fulfill their own goals. 4.3 Experimental Complexity Revisited We evaluated the experimental complexity of the whole multiagent system when all the rules are activated.",

                "DISCUSSION & PERSPECTIVES 5.1 Current Limitation of our Approach The most important limitation of our current algorithm is that the result depends on the order the data gets added.",

                "We need to improve our distributed algorithm to allow a concept to move along a branch.",
                "We are currently working on the required rules, but the comparison with centralized algorithm will become very difficult.",
                "In particular since they will take into account criteria ignored by the centralized algorithm. 5.2 Pruning for Ontologies Building In section 3, we presented the distributed clustering algorithm used in the Dynamo system.",
                "Since this work was first based on this algorithm, it introduced a clear bias toward binary trees as a result.",
                "But we have to keep in mind that we are trying to obtain taxonomies which are more refined and concise.",
                "Although the head coverage rule is an improvement because it is based on how the ontologists generally work, it only addresses low level structuring but not the intermediate levels of the tree.",
                "By looking at figure 7, it is clear that some pruning could be done in the taxonomy.",
                "In particular, since lésion moved, ConceptAgent:9 could be removed, it is not needed anymore.",
                "Moreover the branch starting with ConceptAgent:8 clearly respects the constraint to make a binary tree, but it would be more useful to the user in a more compact and meaningful form.",
                "In this case ConceptAgent:10 and ConceptAgent:11 could probably be merged.",
                "Currently, our system has the necessary rules to create intermediate levels in the taxonomy, or to have concepts shifting towards the leaf.",
                "As we pointed, it is not enough, so new rules are needed to allow removing nodes from the tree, or move them toward the root.",
                "Most of the work needed to develop those rules consists in finding the relevant statistic information that will support the ontologist. 6.",

                "Its strengths are mostly qualitative since it allows more subtle user interactions and a progressive adaptation to new linguistic based information.",
