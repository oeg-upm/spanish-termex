Jennings University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK. {eg,rkd,dy,nrj}@ecs.soton.ac.uk ABSTRACT We derive optimal bidding strategies for a global bidding agent that participates in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions with perfect substitutes. We first consider a model where all other bidders are local and participate in a single auction. For this case, we prove that, assuming free disposal, the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions, irrespective of the local bidders valuation distribution. Furthermore, for non-decreasing valuation distributions, we prove that the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to two dimensions. These results hold both in the case where the number of local bidders is known and when this number is determined by a Poisson distribution. This analysis extends to online markets where, typically, auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially. In addition, by combining analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global bidders, provided that the market consists of both global and local bidders. Finally, we address the efficiency of the overall market, and show that information about the number of local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which a global bidder affects efficiency.

INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10]. In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 . Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions. To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes. As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently. To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions). In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes. In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions. We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings. However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions. Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution. In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction. For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations. However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions. We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder. Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy. By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy. In fact it fluctuates between two states. If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. In Section 3 we describe the bidders and the auctions in more detail. In Section 4 we investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for it. Section 5 considers the case with multiple global bidders and in Section 6 we address the market efficiency. Finally, Section 7 concludes. 2. RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines. On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11]. Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions). On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5]. This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies. In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods. Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser. Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously. They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large. Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents). Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods. They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency. The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9]. However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider. This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders). The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general. Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes. However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3. BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer. Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item). The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 . However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4. We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another). Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price. This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting. Firstly, it is communication efficient. Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known). This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders. The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one. Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 . We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic. In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction. In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction. This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1). As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them. However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally. Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) participate in auctions that they are already familiar with. Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item. Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions. This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally. Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one. An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy. Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions. This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction. As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders. In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally. The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4. A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation. After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available. In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples. Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1. A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax]. F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders. A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions). For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b). Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit. In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction. The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments. To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions. Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2). However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!). Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders. To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero. As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y). Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N . Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution. By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y). This concludes our proof. The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions. To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction. More formally, Theorem 1 Consider a global bidder with valuation 0 < v < vmax and global bid B, where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ B. Suppose B contains no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}, then there exists a bj > 0 such that U(B∪{bj }, v) > U(B, v). Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 281 Let bj = , where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive value. Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0). Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0. Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v). This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods. In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand. First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0. In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0). In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0. However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax. Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions. It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant. Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2. That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values. Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow. More formally: Theorem 2 Suppose the probability density function f is non-decreasing within the range [0, vmax], then the following proposition holds: given v > 0, for any bi ∈ B, either bi = bhigh, bi = blow, or bi = bhigh = blow. Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns. Now, by combining these equations, we obtain the following relationship: b1(1 − G(b1)) = b2(1 − G(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − G(bm)). By defining H(b) = b(1 − G(b)) we can rewrite the equation to: H(b1) = H(b2) = . . . = H(bm) = v bj ∈B (1 − G(bj )) (7) In order to prove that there exist at most two different bids, it is sufficient to show that b = H−1 (y) has at most two solutions that satisfy 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax for any y. To see this, suppose H−1 (y) has two solutions but there exists a third bid bj = blow = bhigh. From equation 7 it then follows that there exists a y such that H(bj) = H(blow) = H(bhigh) = y. Therefore, H−1 (y) must have at least three solutions, which is a contradiction. Now, note that, in order to prove that H−1 (y) has at most two solutions, it is necessary and sufficient to show that H(b) has at most one local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax. A sufficient conditions, however, is for H(b) to be strictly concave4 . The function H is strictly concave if and only if the following condition holds: H (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − G(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where H (b) = d2 H/db2 . By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db. Since both f and F are positive, conditions 9 and 10 clearly hold for f (b) ≥ 0. In other words, conditions 9 and 10 show that H(b) is strictly concave when the probability density function is non-decreasing for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, completing our proof. Note from conditions 9 and 10 that the requirement of non-decreasing density functions is sufficient, but far from necessary. Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions. As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases. Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other. Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily. Furthermore, note that, if Mlow = 1 or Mhigh = 1, equation 6 can be used directly to find the desired value. Using the above, we are able to reduce the bid search space to a single continuous dimension, given Mlow or Mhigh. However, we do not know the number of auctions in which to bid blow and bhigh, and thus we need to search M different combinations to find the optimal global bid. Moreover, for each 4 More precisely, H(b) can be either strictly convex or strictly concave. However, it is easy to see that H is not convex since H(0) = H(vmax) = 0, and H(b) ≥ 0 for 0 < b < vmax. 282 The Sixth Intl.

In addition, for comparison, the dark solid line in the right figure depicts the expected utility when bidding locally in a randomly selected auction, given there are no global bidders (note that, in case of local bidders only, the expected utility is not affected by M). combination, the optimal blow and bhigh can vary. Therefore, in order to find the optimal bid for a bidder with valuation v, it is sufficient to search along one continuous variable blow ∈ [0, v], and a discrete variable Mlow = M − Mhigh ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}. 4.3.2 Empirical Evaluation In this section, we present results from an empirical study and characterise the optimal global bid for specific cases. Furthermore, we measure the actual utility improvement that can be obtained when using the global strategy. The results presented here are based on a uniform distribution of the valuations with vmax = 1, and the static local bidder model, but they generalise to the dynamic model and other distributions (not shown due to space limitations). Figure 1 illustrates the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected utility for various M and N = 5, but again the bid curves for different values of M and N follow a very similar pattern. Here, the bid is normalised by the valuation v to give the bid fraction x = b/v. Note that, when x = 1, a bidder bids its true value. As shown in Figure 1, for bidders with a relatively low valuation, the optimal strategy is to submit M equal bids at, or very close to, the true value. The optimal bid fraction then gradually decreases for higher valuations. Interestingly, in most cases, placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point. A socalled pitchfork bifurcation is then observed and the optimal bids split into two values: a single high bid and M − 1 low ones. This transition is smooth for M = 2, but exhibits an abrupt jump for M ≥ 3. In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others. In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero. As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions. In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax. The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally. This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions. In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale). In particular, we notice that a global bidder with a low valuation can improve its utility by up to M times the expected utility of bidding locally. Intuitively, this is because the chance of winning one of the auctions increases by up to a factor M, whereas the increase in the expected cost is negligible. For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction. 4.4 Sequential and Concurrent Auctions In this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding strategy to sequential auctions. Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously. Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 . It turns out that the analysis for the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can be easily extended to include sequential auctions. In the following, the number of simultaneous auctions in round r is denoted by Mr, and the set of bids in that round by Br. As before, the analysis assumes that all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction. Furthermore, we assume that the global bidders have complete knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round. The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions. For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following. The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing). In that case, however, it is optimal to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known, thereby reducing the chance of unwittingly winning multiple items. Using this strategy, overlapping auctions effectively become sequential and can thus be analysed using the results in this section. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 283 Note that equation 13 is almost identical to equation 5 in Section 4.3, except that the valuation v is now replaced by v−Ur+1. The optimal bidding strategy can thus be found by backward induction (where UR+1 = 0) using the procedure outlined in Section 4.3. 5. MULTIPLE GLOBAL BIDDERS As argued in section 3.2, we expect a real-world market to exhibit a mix of global and local bidders. Whereas so far we assumed a single global bidder, in this section we consider a setting where multiple global bidders interact with one another and with local bidders as well. The analysis of this problem is complex, however, as the optimal bidding strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global bidders. A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy. Due to the complexity of the problem, however, here we combine a computational simulation approach with analytical results. The simulation works by iteratively finding the best response to the optimal bidding strategies in the previous iteration. If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium. 5.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In order to find a global bidders best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders. In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders. Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria. However, we assume that the assignment of functions to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly once by each global bidder). Let Ω denote the set of all possible assignments. Each such assignment ω ∈ Ω is a (M, Ng) matrix, where each entry ωi,j identifies the function used by global bidder j in auction i. Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng . Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy. Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions. The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions. These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated. This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 . Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases. Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 . This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values. The results reported here are based on the following settings.8 In order to emphasize that the valuations are discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000. Each valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case. A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels. Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}. The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before. The initial set of functions can play an important role in the experiments. Therefore, to ensure our results are robust, experiments are repeated with different random initial functions. 5.3 The Results First, we describe the results with no local bidders. For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state. That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state. The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states. Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5. The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders. In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others. The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment. The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction. As a result, there exists no stable solution. The same result is observed when the number of global bidders is less than the number of auctions. This oc6 This approach is similar to an alternating-move bestresponse process with pure strategies [4], although here we consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an opponents best response depends on its valuation. 7 Note that the number of possible allocations still increases with the number of auctions and global bids. However, by merging all utility-equivalent permutations, we significantly increase computation speed, allowing experiments with relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed (e.g., a single iteration with 50 auctions and 10 global bidders takes roughly 30 seconds on a 3.00 Ghz PC). 8 We also performed experiments with different precision, other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders. We find that the prinicipal conclusions generalise to these different settings, and therefore we omit the results to avoid repetitiveness. 284 The Sixth Intl.

The errorbars show the (small) standard deviations. curs since global bidders randomise over auctions, and thus they cannot coordinate and choose to bid high in different auctions. As shown in Figure 2, a similar fluctuation is observed when the number of global bidders increases relative to the number of auctions. However, the bids in the equal-bid state (state 2 in Figure 2), as well as the low bids of the other state, increase. Moreover, if the number of global bidders is increased even further, a bifurcation occurs in the equal-bid state similar to the case without local bidders. We now consider the best response strategies when both local and global bidders participate and each auction contains the same number of local bidders. To this end, Figure 3 shows the average variance of the best response strategies. This is measured as the variance of an actual best-response bid over different iterations, and then taking the average over the discrete bidder valuations. Here, the variance is a gauge for the amount of fluctuation and thus the instability of the strategy. As can be seen from this figure, local bidders have a large stabilising effect on the global bidder strategies. As a result, the best response strategy approximates a pure symmetric Nash equilibrium. We note that the results converge after only a few iterations. The results show that the principal conclusions in the case of a single global bidder carry over to the case of multiple global bidders. That is, the optimal strategy is to bid positive in all auctions (as long as there are at least as many bidders as auctions). Furthermore, a similar bifurcation point is observed. These results are very robust to changes to the auction settings and the parameters of the simulation. To conclude, even though a theoretical analysis proves difficult in case of several global bidders, we can approximate a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for specific settings using a discrete simulation in case the system consists of both local and global bidders. Thus, our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect a combination of local and global bidders. 6. MARKET EFFICIENCY Efficiency is an important system-wide property since it characterises to what extent the market maximises social welfare (i.e. the sum of utilities of all agents in the market). To this end, in this section we study the efficiency of markets with either static or dynamic local bidders, and the impact that a global bidder has on the efficiency in these markets. Specifically, efficiency in this context is maximised when the bidders with the M highest valuations in the entire market obtain a single item each. More formally, we define the efficiency of an allocation as: Definition 1 Efficiency of Allocation. The efficiency ηK of an allocation K is the obtained social welfare proportional to the maximum social welfare that can be achieved in the market and is given by: ηK = NT i=1 vi(K) NT i=1 vi(K∗) , (15) where K∗ = arg maxK∈K NT i=1 vi(K) is an efficient allocation, K is the set of all possible allocations, vi(K) is bidder is utility for the allocation K ∈ K, and NT is the total number of bidders participating across all auctions (including any global bidders). Now, in order to measure the efficiency of the market and the impact of a global bidder, we run simulations for the markets with the different types of local bidders. The experiments are carried out as follows. Each bidders valuation is drawn from a uniform distribution with support [0, 1]. The local bidders bid their true valuations, whereas the global bidder bids optimally in each auction as described in Section 4.3. The experiments are repeated 5000 times for each run to obtain an accurate mean value, and the final average results and standard deviations are taken over 10 runs in order to get statistically significant results. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4. Note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a multiauction market with only local bidders [2].9 For example, if there are two auctions selling one item each, and the two bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally in the same auction, then the bidder with the second-highest value does not obtain the good. Thus, the allocation of items to bidders is inefficient. As can be observed from Figure 4, however, the efficiency increases when N becomes larger. This is because the differences between the bidders with the highest valuations become smaller, thereby decreasing the loss of efficiency. Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static. In the case of dynamic bidders, however, the effect of a global bidder depends on the number of sellers. If M is low (i.e., for M = 2), a global bidder significantly increases the efficiency, especially for low values of 9 Trivial exceptions are when either M = 1 or N = 1 and bidders are static, since the market is then completely efficient without a global bidder.

The error-bars indicate the standard deviation over the 10 runs. N. For M = 6, on the other hand, the presence of a global bidder has a negative effect on the efficiency (this effect becomes even more pronounced for higher values of M). This result is explained as follows. The introduction of a global bidder potentially leads to a decrease of efficiency since this bidder can unwittingly win more than one item. However, as the number of local bidders increase, this is less likely to happen. Rather, since the global bidder increases the number of bidders, its presence makes an overall positive (albeit small) contribution in case of static bidders. In a market with dynamic bidders, however, the market efficiency depends on two other factors. On the one hand, the efficiency increases since items no longer remain unsold (this situation can occur in the dynamic model when no bidder turns up at an auction). On the other hand, as a result of the uncertainty concerning the actual number of bidders, a global bidder is more likely to win multiple items (we confirmed this analytically). As M increases, the first effect becomes negligible whereas the second one becomes more prominent, reducing the efficiency on average. To conclude, the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency clearly depends on the information that is available. In case of static local bidders, the number of bidders is known and the global bidder can bid more accurately. In case of uncertainty, however, the global bidder is more likely to win more than one item, decreasing the overall efficiency. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we derive utility-maximising strategies for bidding in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions. We first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in all auctions, whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction. For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more. Thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy. For a number of common valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions. This considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions. Furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation approach. We find that a global bidders strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well. We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders. The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions. For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases. Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder. We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases. In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items. These results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder. In future work, we intend to extend the results to imperfect substitutes (i.e., when a global bidder gains from winning additional items), and to settings where the auctions are no longer identical. The latter arises, for example, when the number of (average) local bidders differs per auction or the auctions have different settings for parameters such as the reserve price. 8. REFERENCES [1] S.

Yuen y Nicholas R.

Primero consideramos un modelo en el que todos los demás postores son locales y participan en una sola subasta. Para este caso, demostramos que, suponiendo que la eliminación gratuita, el postor global siempre debe realizar ofertas distintas de cero en todas las subastas disponibles, independientemente de la distribución de valoración de los licitadores locales. Además, para las distribuciones de valoración no decisores, demostramos que el problema de encontrar las ofertas óptimas se reduce a dos dimensiones. Estos resultados se mantienen tanto en el caso en que se conoce el número de postores locales como cuando este número está determinado por una distribución de Poisson. Este análisis se extiende a los mercados en línea donde, típicamente, las subastas ocurren simultáneamente y secuencialmente. Además, al combinar resultados analíticos y de simulación, demostramos que resultados similares se mantienen en el caso de varios postores globales, siempre que el mercado consista en licitadores globales y locales. Finalmente, abordamos la eficiencia del mercado general y mostramos que la información sobre el número de licitadores locales es un determinante importante para la forma en que un postor global afecta la eficiencia.

Introducción El reciente aumento de interés en las subastas en línea ha resultado en un número creciente de subastas que ofrecen bienes y servicios muy similares o idénticos [9, 10]. Solo en eBay, por ejemplo, a menudo hay cientos o, a veces, incluso miles de subastas concurrentes que se ejecutan en todo el mundo que venden tales artículos sustituibles 1. En este contexto, es esencial desarrollar estrategias de licitación que los agentes autónomos puedan usar para operar de manera efectiva en un amplio número de subastas. Con este fin, en este documento diseñamos y analizamos estrategias de licitación óptimas para un entorno importante pero apenas estudiado, a saber, un agente que participa en subastas de segundo precio múltiples, concurrentes (es decir, simultáneas) para los bienes que son sustitutos perfectos. Sin embargo, como mostraremos, este análisis también es relevante para un contexto más amplio donde las subastas se realizan secuencialmente, así como simultáneamente. Hasta la fecha, gran parte de la literatura existente en múltiples subastas se centra en subastas secuenciales [6] o en subastas simultáneas para bienes complementarios, donde el valor de los elementos juntos es mayor que la suma de los elementos individuales (ver Sección 2 para la investigación relacionada sobresubastas simultáneas). En contraste, aquí consideramos estrategias de licitación para mercados con múltiples subastas concurrentes y sustitutos perfectos. En particular, nuestro enfoque está en Vickrey o subastas de ofertas selladas de segundo precio. Elegimos porque requieren poca comunicación y son bien conocidos por su capacidad para inducir una licitación veraz, lo que los hace adecuados para muchas configuraciones del sistema de múltiples agentes. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados se generalizan a la configuración con subastas en inglés, ya que estos son estratégicamente equivalentes a las subastas de segundo precio. Dentro de este entorno, podemos caracterizar, por primera vez, una estrategia que Maximizan la utilidad de los licitantes para ofertar simultáneamente en cualquier número de subastas y para cualquier tipo de distribución de valoración del postor. Con más detalle, primero consideramos un mercado en el que un solo postor, llamado postor global, puede ofertar en cualquier número de subastas, mientras que los otros licitadores, llamados licitadores locales, se supone que ofertan solo en una sola subasta. Para este caso, encontramos los siguientes resultados: • Mientras que en el caso de una sola subasta de segundo precio, una mejor estrategia de licitantes es ofertar su verdadero valor, la mejor estrategia para un postor global es ofertar por debajo de ella.• Podemos demostrar que, incluso si un postor global requiere solo un artículo, la utilidad esperada se maximiza participando en todas las subastas que venden el artículo deseado.• Encontrar la oferta óptima para cada subasta puede ser una tarea ardua al considerar todas las combinaciones posibles. Sin embargo, para las distribuciones de valoración del postor más comunes, podemos reducir significativamente este espacio de búsqueda y, por lo tanto, el cálculo requerido.• Empíricamente, encontramos que la utilidad esperada de los postores se maximiza al ofertar relativamente alta en una de las subastas, y igual o menor en todas las demás subastas. Luego consideramos los mercados con más de un postor mundial. Debido a la complejidad del problema, combinamos resultados analíticos con una simulación discreta para derivar numéricamente la estrategia de licitación óptima. Al hacerlo, encontramos que, en un mercado solo con postores globales, la dinámica de la mejor respuesta no convergen a una estrategia pura. De hecho, fluctúa entre dos estados. Sin embargo, si el mercado consta de licitadores locales y globales, la estrategia de licitadores globales alcanza rápidamente una solución estable y aproximamos un equilibrio simétrico de NASH. El resto del documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 discute el trabajo relacionado. En la Sección 3 describimos a los postores y las subastas con más detalle. En la Sección 4 investigamos el caso con un solo postor global y caracterizamos el comportamiento de licitación óptimo para ello. La Sección 5 considera el caso con múltiples postores globales y en la Sección 6 abordamos la eficiencia del mercado. Finalmente, la Sección 7 concluye.2. La investigación laboral relacionada en el área de subastas simultáneas se puede segmentar a lo largo de dos líneas amplias. Por un lado, existe el análisis teórico y teórico teórico del juego de subastas simultáneas que se concentra en estudiar la estrategia de equilibrio de los agentes racionales [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11]. Dichos análisis se usan típicamente cuando el formato de subasta empleado en las subastas concurrentes es el mismo (por ejemplo, hay subastas de Vickrey o subastas de primer precio). Por otro lado, se han desarrollado estrategias heurísticas para entornos más complejos cuando los vendedores ofrecen diferentes tipos de subastas o los compradores deben comprar paquetes de bienes sobre subastas distribuidas [1, 13, 5]. Este artículo adopta el enfoque anterior en el estudio de un mercado de subastas simultáneas de Vickrey, ya que este enfoque produce estrategias de licitación demostrablemente óptimas. En este caso, el documento seminal de Engelbrecht-Wiggans y Weber proporciona uno de los puntos de partida para el análisis gameorético de los mercados distribuidos donde los compradores tienen bienes sustituibles. Su trabajo analiza un mercado que consiste en parejas que tienen valoraciones iguales que desean ofertar por un tocador. Por lo tanto, el espacio de ofertas de parejas puede contener a la mayoría de las dos ofertas, ya que el esposo y la esposa pueden ser como máximo en dos subastas geográficamente distribuidas simultáneamente. Derivan un equilibrio de Nash de estrategia mixta para el caso especial donde el número de compradores es grande. Nuestro análisis difiere de ellos en el sentido de que estudiamos subastas concurrentes en las que los licitadores tienen diferentes valoraciones y el postor global puede ofertar en todas las subastas simultáneamente (lo que es completamente posible dados agentes autónomos). Después de esto, [7] estudió el caso de subastas simultáneas con bienes complementarios. Analizan el caso de los postores locales y globales y caracterizan la licitación de los compradores y la eficiencia del mercado resultante. La configuración proporcionada en [7] se extiende aún más al caso de valores comunes en [9]. Sin embargo, ninguno de estos trabajos se extiende fácilmente al caso de bienes sustituibles que consideramos. Este caso se estudia en [12], pero el escenario considerado está restringido a tres vendedores y dos postores globales y cada licitador tiene el mismo valor (y por lo tanto conoce el valor de otros postores). El espacio de estrategias simétricas de equilibrio mixto se deriva para este caso especial, pero nuevamente nuestro resultado es más general. Finalmente, [11] considera el caso de subastas concurrentes en inglés, en el que desarrolla algoritmos de licitación para compradores con diferentes actitudes de riesgo. Sin embargo, obliga a las ofertas a ser las mismas en las subastas, que mostramos en este documento no siempre es óptima.3. Pidiendo en múltiples subastas El modelo consiste en M vendedores, cada uno de los cuales actúa como subastador. Cada vendedor subasta un artículo;Estos elementos son sustitutos completos (es decir, son iguales en términos de valor y un postor no obtiene un beneficio adicional al ganar más de un artículo). Las subastas M se ejecutan simultáneamente;Es decir, terminan simultáneamente y no hay información sobre el resultado de ninguna de las subastas disponibles hasta que se realicen las ofertas2. Sin embargo, abordamos brevemente los mercados con subastas secuenciales y concurrentes en la Sección 4.4. También suponemos que todas las subastas son equivalentes (es decir, un postor no prefiere una subasta sobre otra). Finalmente, asumimos la eliminación gratuita (es decir, un ganador de múltiples artículos no incurre en costos adicionales al descartar los no deseados) y los postores neutrales de riesgo.3.1 Las subastas La subasta de los vendedores se implementa como una subasta de Vickrey, donde el mejor postor gana pero paga el segundo precio más alto. Este formato tiene varias ventajas para una configuración basada en agentes. En primer lugar, es eficiente en la comunicación. En segundo lugar, para el caso de subasta única (es decir, donde un postor realiza una oferta como máximo una subasta), la estrategia óptima es ofertar el valor verdadero y, por lo tanto, no requiere cálculo (una vez que se conoce la valoración del elemento). Esta estrategia también es débilmente dominante (es decir, es independiente de las decisiones de los otros licitadores) y, por lo tanto, no requiere información sobre las preferencias de otros agentes (como la distribución de sus valoraciones).3.2 Pidadores globales y locales distinguimos entre los postores globales y locales. El primero puede ofertar en cualquier número de subastas, mientras que el segundo solo oferta en una sola. Se supone que los postores locales ofertan de acuerdo con la estrategia débilmente dominante y ofertan su verdadera valoración3. Consideramos dos formas de modelar a los postores locales: estática y dinámica. En el primer modelo, se supone que el número de licitadores locales es conocido e igual a N para cada subasta. En el último modelo, por otro lado, el número promedio de postores es igual a N, pero el número exacto es desconocido y puede variar para cada subasta. Esta incertidumbre se modela utilizando una distribución de Poisson (se proporcionan más detalles en la Sección 4.1). Como mostraremos más adelante, un postor global que ofrece de manera óptima una utilidad esperada más alta en comparación con un postor local, a pesar de que los artículos son sustitutos completos y un postor solo requiere uno de ellos. Sin embargo, podemos identificar una serie de razones convincentes por las cuales no todos los licitadores elegirían ofertar a nivel mundial. En primer lugar, los costos de participación, como las tarifas de entrada y el tiempo para configurar una cuenta, pueden alentar a los usuarios ocasionales a 2, aunque este documento se centra en las subastas de licitación sellada, donde este es el caso, las condiciones son similares para las ofertas de último minuto en subastas en inglés tales comocomo eBay [10].3 Tenga en cuenta que, dado que la oferta, el valor verdadero es óptimo para los licitadores locales, independientemente de lo que otros están haciendo una oferta, su estrategia no se ve afectada por la presencia de los licitadores globales.280 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) participan en subastas con las que ya están familiarizados. En segundo lugar, los postores simplemente pueden no estar al tanto de otras subastas que venden el mismo tipo de artículo. Sin embargo, incluso si esto se sabe, se requiere información adicional, como la distribución de las valoraciones de otros postores y el número de licitadores participantes para ofertar de manera óptima en múltiples subastas. Esta falta de información experta a menudo impulsa a un novato a ofertar localmente. En tercer lugar, una estrategia global óptima es más difícil de calcular que una local. Por lo tanto, un agente con racionalidad limitada no puede tener los recursos para calcular dicha estrategia. Por último, a pesar de que un postor mundial se beneficia en promedio, dicho postor puede incurrir en una pérdida cuando inadvertidamente gana múltiples subastas. Esto disuade a los postores que son reacios al riesgo o tienen restricciones presupuestarias de participar en una subasta múltiple. Como resultado, en la mayoría de los mercados, esperamos una combinación de postores globales y locales. En vista de las consideraciones anteriores, los compradores humanos tienen más probabilidades de ofertar localmente. Sin embargo, la estrategia global puede ser ejecutada de manera efectiva por los agentes autónomos, ya que pueden recopilar datos de muchas subastas y realizar los cálculos requeridos dentro del marco de tiempo deseado.4. Un solo postor global en esta sección, proporcionamos un análisis teórico de la estrategia de licitación óptima para un postor global, dado que todos los demás postores son locales y simplemente ofertan su verdadera valoración. Después de describir la utilidad esperada de los licitadores globales en la Sección 4.1, mostramos en la Sección 4.2 que siempre es óptimo que un postor global participe en el número máximo de subastas disponibles. En la Sección 4.3 discutimos cómo reducir significativamente la complejidad de encontrar las ofertas óptimas para el problema de la subasta múltiple, y luego aplicamos estos métodos para encontrar estrategias óptimas para ejemplos específicos. Finalmente, en la Sección 4.4 ampliamos nuestro análisis a subastas secuenciales.4.1 Los licitadores globales esperaban la utilidad en lo que sigue, el número de vendedores (subastas) es M ≥ 2 y el número de postores locales es n ≥ 1. Una valoración de los postores v ∈ [0, vmax] se extrae al azar de una distribución acumulativa F con densidad de probabilidad F, donde F es continuo, estrictamente positivo y tiene soporte [0, Vmax]. Se supone que F es igual y de conocimiento común para todos los postores. Una oferta global B es un conjunto que contiene una oferta bi ∈ [0, vmax] para cada subasta 1 ≤ i ≤ m (las ofertas pueden ser diferentes para diferentes subastas). Para facilitar la exposición, presentamos la función de distribución acumulativa para las estadísticas de primer orden G (b) = f (b) n ∈ [0, 1], denotando la probabilidad de ganar una subasta específica condicional para colocar la oferta B en esta subasta, y su densidad de probabilidad G (b) = dg (b)/db = nf (b) n - 1 f (b). Ahora, la utilidad esperada U para un postor global con Bid B y Valuación V viene dada por: U (B, V) = V ⎡ ⎣1 - Bi∈B (1 - G (BI)) ⎤ ⎦ - Bi∈BBi 0 yg (y) dy (1) Aquí, la parte izquierda de la ecuación es la valoración multiplicada por la probabilidad de que el postor global gane al menos una de las subastas M y, por lo tanto, corresponde al beneficio esperado. Con más detalle, tenga en cuenta que 1 - g (bi) es la probabilidad de no ganar una subasta I al ofertar bi, bi∈B (1 - g (bi)) es la probabilidad de no ganar ninguna subasta, y por lo tanto 1 - bi∈B (1 - g (bi)) es la probabilidad de ganar al menos una subasta. La parte correcta de la ecuación 1 corresponde a los costos o pagos totales esperados. Para ver a este último, tenga en cuenta que el pago esperado de una sola subasta de segundo precio cuando la oferta B es igual a B 0 yg (y) dy (ver [6]) y es independiente de los pagos esperados por otras subastas. Claramente, la ecuación 1 se aplica al modelo con licitadores locales estáticos, es decir, donde el número de postores es conocido e igual para cada subasta (ver Sección 3.2). Sin embargo, podemos usar la misma ecuación para modelar los licitadores locales dinámicos de la siguiente manera: Lema 1 reemplazando el estadístico de primer orden G (y) con ˆg (y) = en (f (y) −1), (2)y la función de densidad correspondiente g (y) con ˆg (y) = d ˆg (y)/dy = n f (y) en (f (y) −1), la ecuación 1 se convierte en la utilidad esperada donde el número de licitadores localesEn cada subasta se describe mediante una distribución de Poisson con N promedio (es decir, donde la probabilidad de que los postores locales participen viene dada por P (n) = nn e - n /n!). Prueba para probar esto, primero mostramos que G (·) y F (·) pueden modificarse de tal manera que el número de licitadores por subasta sea dado por una distribución binomial (donde la decisión de los licitadores de participar viene dada por un juicio de Bernoulli) comoSigue: g (y) = f (y) n = (1 - p + p f (y)) n, (3) donde p es la probabilidad de que un postor participe en la subasta, y n es el número total de postores. Para ver esto, tenga en cuenta que no participar es equivalente a la oferta cero. Como resultado, f (0) = 1 - p Dado que hay una probabilidad de 1 - p de que un postor oferte cero en una subasta específica, y f (y) = f (0) + p f (y) ya que hay unProbabilidad P que un postor oferte de acuerdo con la distribución original f (y). Ahora, el número promedio de licitadores participantes viene dado por N = P N. reemplazando P con N/N, la ecuación 3 se convierte en g (y) = (1 - n/n + (n/n) f (y)) n n. Tenga en cuenta que una distribución de Poisson viene dada por el límite de una distribución binomial. Al mantener n constante y tomar el límite n → ∞, obtenemos g (y) = en (f (y) −1) = ˆg (y). Esto concluye nuestra prueba. Los resultados que siguen se aplican al modelo estático y dinámico a menos que se indique lo contrario.4.2 Participación en múltiples subastas Ahora mostramos que, para cualquier valoración 0 <v <vmax, un postor global de utilidad que siempre debe hacer ofertas distintas de cero en todas las subastas disponibles. Para probar esto, mostramos que la utilidad esperada aumenta al colocar una oferta arbitrariamente pequeña en comparación con no participar en una subasta. Más formalmente, el Teorema 1 considere a un postor global con valoración 0 <v <vmax y bid b global, donde bi ≤ v para todos bi ∈ B. Supongamos que B no contiene oferta para la subasta j ∈ {1, 2 ,..., M}, entonces existe un bj> 0 tal que u (b∪ {bj}, v)> u (b, v). Prueba Usando la ecuación 1, la utilidad marginal esperada para participar en una subasta adicional se puede escribir como: u (b ∪ {bj}, v) - u (b, v) = vg (bj) bi∈B (1 - g (bi)) - bj 0 yg (y) dy ahora, usando la integración por piezas, tenemos bj 0 yg (y) = bjg (bj) - bj 0 g (y) dy y la ecuación anterior puede reescribirse como: u (B ∪ {bj}, v) - u (b, v) = g (bj) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 - g (bi)) - bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 g (y) dy (4) elSexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 281 Sea bj =, donde es un valor estrictamente positivo arbitrariamente pequeño. Claramente, G (bj) y bj 0 g (y) dy son entonces estrictamente positivos (ya que f (y)> 0). Además, dado que bi ≤ v <vmax para bi ∈ B y que v> 0, se deduce que v bi∈B (1 - g (bi))> 0. Ahora, supongamos que bj = 1 2 v bi∈B (1 - g (bi)), entonces u (b ∪ {bj}, v) - u (b, v) = g (bj) 1 2 v bi∈B (1 - g (bi)) + bj 0 g (y) dy> 0 y, por lo tanto, u (b ∪ {bj}, v)> u (b, v). Esto completa nuestra prueba.4.3 La oferta global óptima Una solución general a la oferta global óptima requiere la maximización de las dimensiones de la ecuación 1 en M, una tarea ardua, incluso cuando se aplica métodos numéricos. Sin embargo, en esta sección, mostramos cómo reducir todo el espacio de oferta a dos dimensiones en la mayoría de los casos (uno continuo y otro discreto), simplificando significativamente el problema en cuestión. Primero, sin embargo, para encontrar las soluciones óptimas a la Ecuación 1, establecemos los derivados parciales en cero: ∂u ∂Bi = g (bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B \\ {bi} (1 - g (bj))− Bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Ahora, la igualdad 5 se mantiene cuando g (bi) = 0 o cuando bj ∈B \\ {bi} (1 - g (bj)) v - bi = 0. En el modelo dinámico, G (BI) siempre es mayor que cero y, por lo tanto, puede ignorarse (ya que G (0) = Nf (0) E - N y suponemos F (y)> 0). En el modelo estático, g (bi) = 0 solo cuando bi = 0. Sin embargo, el teorema 1 muestra que la oferta óptima no es cero para 0 <v <vmax. Por lo tanto, podemos ignorar la primera parte, y la segunda parte produce: bi = v bj ∈B \\ {bi} (1 - g (bj)) (6) En otras palabras, la oferta óptima en la subasta I es igual a laValoración de los postores multiplicado por la probabilidad de no ganar ninguna de las otras subastas. Es sencillo demostrar que la segunda derivada parcial es negativa, lo que confirma que la solución es un máximo cuando se mantiene constantes todas las demás ofertas. Por lo tanto, la ecuación 6 proporciona un medio para derivar la oferta óptima de la subasta I, dadas las ofertas en todas las demás subastas.4.3.1 Reducción del espacio de búsqueda En lo que sigue, mostramos que, para las funciones de densidad de probabilidad no dañadas (como las distribuciones uniformes y logarítmicas), la oferta global óptima consiste en la mayoría de los dos valores diferentes para cualquier m ≥ 2. Es decir, el espacio de búsqueda para encontrar la oferta óptima puede reducirse a dos valores continuos. Deje que estos valores sean bhigh y sople, donde Bhigh ≥ sopla. Más formalmente: el teorema 2 Suponga que la función de densidad de probabilidad F no es decreciente dentro del rango [0, vmax], entonces la siguiente proposición se mantiene: dada v> 0, para cualquier bi ∈ B, o bi = bhigh, bi = blow,o bi = bhigh = golpe. Prueba usando la ecuación 6, podemos producir ecuaciones m, una para cada subasta, con m incógnitas. Ahora, al combinar estas ecuaciones, obtenemos la siguiente relación: B1 (1 - G (B1)) = B2 (1 - G (B2)) =...= BM (1 - G (BM)). Al definir h (b) = b (1 - g (b)) podemos reescribir la ecuación a: h (b1) = h (b2) =...= H (bm) = v bj ∈B (1 - g (bj)) (7) Para demostrar que existen como la mayoría de las dos ofertas diferentes, es suficiente para mostrar que b = h - 1 (y) tiene enLa mayoría de las dos soluciones que satisfacen 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax para cualquier y. Para ver esto, supongamos que H - 1 (y) tiene dos soluciones, pero existe una tercera oferta bj = Blow = bhigh. De la ecuación 7, luego se deduce que existe una vez que h (bj) = h (sople) = h (bhigh) = y. Por lo tanto, H - 1 (y) debe tener al menos tres soluciones, lo cual es una contradicción. Ahora, tenga en cuenta que, para demostrar que H - 1 (y) tiene como máximo dos soluciones, es necesario y suficiente para mostrar que H (b) tiene como máximo un máximo local para 0 ≤ b ≤ Vmax. Sin embargo, una condición suficiente es que H (b) sea estrictamente cóncavas4. La función H es estrictamente cóncava si y solo si la siguiente condición es válida: h (b) = d db (1 - b · g (b) - g (b)) = - b dg db + 2g (b) <0 (0 (8) donde h (b) = d2 h/db2. Al realizar cálculos estándar, obtenemos la siguiente condición para el modelo estático: b (n - 1) f (b) f (b) + n f (b) f (b)> −2 para 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, ((9) y de manera similar para el modelo dinámico tenemos: b n f (b) + f (b) f (b)> −2 para 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) donde f (b) = df/db. Dado que tanto F como F son positivos, las condiciones 9 y 10 se mantienen claramente para F (b) ≥ 0. En otras palabras, las condiciones 9 y 10 muestran que H (b) es estrictamente cóncavo cuando la función de densidad de probabilidad no es deja para 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, completando nuestra prueba. Tenga en cuenta de las Condiciones 9 y 10 que el requisito de funciones de densidad que no sean rechazantes es suficiente, pero lejos de ser necesario. Además, la condición 8 que requiere que H (b) sea estrictamente cóncava también es más fuerte de lo necesario para garantizar solo dos soluciones. Como resultado, en la práctica encontramos que la reducción del espacio de búsqueda se aplica a la mayoría de los casos. Dado que hay como máximo 2 ofertas posibles, Blow y Bhigh, podemos reducir aún más el espacio de búsqueda expresando una oferta en términos de la otra. Supongamos que el comprador coloca una oferta de golpe en subastas de mlow y bhigh para las subastas Mhigh M -mlow restantes, la ecuación 6 se convierte en: Bloque = V (1 - g (sople)) mlow - 1 (1 - g (bhigh))Mhigh, y se puede reorganizar para dar: bhigh = g - 1 1 - golpe v (1 - g (sople)) mlow - 1 1 mhigh (11) Aquí, la función inversa G - 1 (·) generalmente se puede obtener bastantefácilmente. Además, tenga en cuenta que, si mlow = 1 o mhigh = 1, la ecuación 6 se puede usar directamente para encontrar el valor deseado. Usando lo anterior, podemos reducir el espacio de búsqueda de ofertas a una sola dimensión continua, dada Mlow o Mhigh. Sin embargo, no sabemos el número de subastas para ofertar y Bhigh, y por lo tanto necesitamos buscar en diferentes combinaciones para encontrar la oferta global óptima. Además, para cada 4 más precisamente, H (b) puede ser estrictamente convexo o estrictamente cóncavo. Sin embargo, es fácil ver que H no es convexo ya que h (0) = H (Vmax) = 0 y H (b) ≥ 0 para 0 <b <vmax.282 El sexto intl.

Además, a comparación, la línea continua oscura en la figura correcta representa la utilidad esperada cuando se ofrece localmente en una subasta seleccionada al azar, dado que no hay licitadores globales (tenga en cuenta que, en caso de licitadores locales, la utilidad esperada no se ve afectadapor m).Combinación, el golpe óptimo y Bhigh pueden variar. Por lo tanto, para encontrar la oferta óptima para un postor con valoración v, es suficiente buscar a lo largo de una variable continua soplete ∈ [0, v], y una variable discreta mlow = m - mhigh ∈ {1, 2 ,..., M}.4.3.2 Evaluación empírica En esta sección, presentamos los resultados de un estudio empírico y caracterizamos la oferta global óptima para casos específicos. Además, medimos la mejora de la utilidad real que se puede obtener al usar la estrategia global. Los resultados presentados aquí se basan en una distribución uniforme de las valoraciones con Vmax = 1, y el modelo de postor local estático, pero se generalizan al modelo dinámico y otras distribuciones (no se muestran debido a limitaciones de espacio). La Figura 1 ilustra las ofertas globales óptimas y la utilidad esperada correspondiente para varios M y N = 5, pero nuevamente las curvas de oferta para diferentes valores de M y N siguen un patrón muy similar. Aquí, la oferta se normaliza mediante la valoración v para dar la fracción de oferta x = b/v. Tenga en cuenta que, cuando x = 1, un postor ofrece su verdadero valor. Como se muestra en la Figura 1, para los licitadores con una valoración relativamente baja, la estrategia óptima es presentar m iguales ofertas en o muy cerca del valor verdadero. La fracción de oferta óptima disminuye gradualmente para valoraciones más altas. Curiosamente, en la mayoría de los casos, colocar ofertas iguales ya no es la estrategia óptima después de que la valoración alcanza un cierto punto. Luego se observa una bifurcación de Pitchfork succionada y las ofertas óptimas se dividen en dos valores: una sola oferta alta y M - 1 baja. Esta transición es suave para M = 2, pero exhibe un salto abrupto para M ≥ 3. Sin embargo, en todos los experimentos, observamos constantemente que la estrategia óptima siempre es colocar una oferta alta en una subasta, y una oferta igual o menor en todos los demás. En el caso de una bifurcación y cuando la valoración se acerca a VMAX, la oferta alta óptima va al valor verdadero y las ofertas bajas van a cero. Como se ilustra en la Figura 1, la utilidad de un postor global se vuelve progresivamente más alto con más subastas. En términos absolutos, la mejora es especialmente alta para los postores que tienen una valoración superior al promedio, pero no demasiado cerca de VMAX. Los postores en este rango se benefician más de la oferta a nivel mundial. Esto se debe a que los postores con valoraciones muy bajas tienen una posibilidad muy pequeña de ganar cualquier subasta, mientras que los postores con una valoración muy alta tienen una alta probabilidad de ganar una sola subasta y beneficiarse menos de participar en más subastas. Por el contrario, si consideramos la utilidad en relación con la licitación en una sola subasta, esto es mucho más alto para los postores con valoraciones relativamente bajas (este efecto no se puede ver claramente en la Figura 1 debido a la escala). En particular, notamos que un postor global con una valoración baja puede mejorar su utilidad hasta M veces la utilidad esperada de ofertas localmente. Intuitivamente, esto se debe a que la posibilidad de ganar una de las subastas aumenta hasta un factor M, mientras que el aumento en el costo esperado es insignificante. Sin embargo, para los compradores de alta valoración, el beneficio no es tan obvio porque las posibilidades de ganar son relativamente altas incluso en caso de una sola subasta.4.4 Subastas secuenciales y concurrentes En esta sección ampliamos nuestro análisis de la estrategia de licitación óptima a subastas secuenciales. Específicamente, el proceso de subasta consta de rondas R, y en cada ronda cualquier número de subastas se ejecutan simultáneamente. Tal combinación de subastas secuenciales y concurrentes es muy común en la práctica, especialmente en línea5. Resulta que el análisis para el caso de subastas simultáneas es bastante general y puede extenderse fácilmente para incluir subastas secuenciales. A continuación, el número de subastas simultáneas en la ronda R se denota por MR, y el conjunto de ofertas en esa ronda por BR. Como antes, el análisis supone que todos los demás postores son locales y ofertan en una sola subasta. Además, suponemos que los postores globales tienen un conocimiento completo sobre el número de rondas y el número de subastas en cada ronda. La utilidad esperada en la ronda R, denotada por UR, es similar a antes (Ecuación 1 en la Sección 4.1), excepto que ahora se puede obtener un beneficio adicional de las subastas futuras si el elemento deseado no se gana en uno de los conjuntos actuales de subastas simultáneas. Por conveniencia, UR (BR, MR) se abrevia a UR a continuación. La utilidad esperada se convierte así en: ur = v · pr (br) - bri∈Br bri 0 yg (y) dy+ur+1 · (1 - pr (br)) = ur+1+(v - ur+1)Pr (br) - bri∈Br bri 0 yg (y) dy, (12) donde pr (br) = 1 - bri∈Br (1 - g (bri)) es la probabilidad de ganar al menos una subasta en la ronda R.Ahora, tomamos el derivado parcial de la ecuación 12 para encontrar la oferta óptima de BRJ para la subasta J en la ronda R: ∂us ∂Brj = G (Brj) ⎡ ⎣ (V - US+1) Bri∈Br \\ {Brj}(1 - g (bri)) - brj ⎤ ⎦ ⎦ (13) 5 en lugar de ser de naturaleza puramente secuencial, las subastas en línea también a menudo se superponen (es decir, nuevas subastas pueden comenzar mientras que otras aún están en curso). En ese caso, sin embargo, es óptimo esperar y ofertar en las nuevas subastas solo después de que se conozca el resultado de las subastas anteriores, reduciendo así la posibilidad de ganar múltiples artículos involuntariamente. Usando esta estrategia, las subastas superpuestas se vuelven secuenciales y, por lo tanto, pueden analizarse utilizando los resultados en esta sección. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 283 Tenga en cuenta que la ecuación 13 es casi idéntica a la ecuación 5 en la Sección 4.3, excepto que la valoración V ahora es reemplazada por V-UR+1. La estrategia de licitación óptima se puede encontrar mediante inducción hacia atrás (donde UR+1 = 0) utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la Sección 4.3.5. Múltiples postores globales como se argumentó en la Sección 3.2, esperamos que un mercado del mundo real exhiba una combinación de licitadores globales y locales. Mientras que hasta ahora asumimos un solo postor global, en esta sección consideramos un entorno en el que múltiples postores globales interactúan entre sí y también con los postores locales. Sin embargo, el análisis de este problema es complejo, ya que la estrategia de licitación óptima de un postor global depende de la estrategia de otros licitadores mundiales. Un enfoque analítico típico es encontrar la solución simétrica de equilibrio NASH [9, 12], que ocurre cuando todos los postores globales usan la misma estrategia para producir sus ofertas, y ningún postor (global) tiene algún incentivo para desviarse unilateralmente de la estrategia elegida. Sin embargo, debido a la complejidad del problema, aquí combinamos un enfoque de simulación computacional con resultados analíticos. La simulación funciona al encontrar la mejor respuesta a las estrategias de licitación óptimas en la iteración anterior. Si esto resulte en un resultado estable (es decir, cuando las estrategias de licitación óptimas permanecen sin cambios para dos iteraciones posteriores), la solución es, por definición, un equilibrio NASH (simétrico).5.1 Los licitadores globales esperaban la utilidad para encontrar una mejor respuesta de los postores globales, primero debemos calcular la utilidad esperada dada la oferta global B y las estrategias de los otros licitadores mundiales y de los postores locales. A continuación, deje que Ng denote el número de otros postores globales. Además, deje que las estrategias de los otros licitadores globales estén representadas por el conjunto de funciones βk (v), 1 ≤ k ≤ m, produciendo una oferta para cada subasta dada una valoración de los licitadores v. Tenga en cuenta que todos los demás licitadores mundiales usan el mismo conjuntode funciones desde que consideramos equilibrios simétricos. Sin embargo, suponemos que la asignación de funciones a las subastas por parte de cada postor global ocurre de manera aleatoria sin reemplazo (es decir, cada función es asignada exactamente una vez por cada postor global). Deje que Ω denote el conjunto de todas las tareas posibles. Cada una asignación ω ∈ ω es una matriz (m, ng), donde cada entrada ωi, j identifica la función utilizada por el postor global j en una subasta i. Tenga en cuenta que la cardinalidad de Ω, denotada por | ω |, es igual a m! Ng. Ahora, la utilidad esperada es la utilidad promedio esperada sobre todas las tareas posibles y viene dada por: U (B, V) = 1 | ω |ω∈ω V ⎛ ⎝1 - Bi∈B (1 - iωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ - 1 | ω |ω∈ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y) dy, (14) donde ˜gΩi (b) = g (b) · ng j = 1 b 0 βωi, j (y) f (y) dy denota elProbabilidad de ganar la subasta I, dado que cada postor global 1 ≤ j ≤ ng oferta de acuerdo con la función βωi, j, y ˜gωi (y) = d ˜gωi (y)/dy. Aquí, G (b) es la probabilidad de ganar una subasta con solo licitadores locales como se describe en la Sección 4.1, y F (y) es la densidad de probabilidad de las valoraciones del postor como antes.5.2 La simulación La simulación funciona discretizando el espacio de posibles valoraciones y ofertas y luego encontrando una mejor respuesta a un conjunto inicial de funciones de licitación. La mejor respuesta se encuentra maximizando la ecuación 14 para cada valoración discreta, lo que, a su vez, da como resultado un nuevo conjunto de funciones de licitación. Estas funciones afectan las probabilidades de ganar en la próxima iteración para la cual se calcula la nueva mejor estrategia de respuesta. Este proceso se repite luego para un número fijo de iteraciones o hasta que se haya encontrado una solución estable 6. Claramente, debido al gran espacio de búsqueda, encontrar la oferta global de utilidad que la meta se vuelve inviable rápidamente a medida que aumenta el número de subastas y postores globales. Por lo tanto, reducimos el espacio de búsqueda al limitar la oferta global a dos dimensiones donde un postor global ofrece un alto en una de las subastas y bajo en todos los demás7. Esta simplificación se justifica por los resultados en la Sección 4.3.1 que muestran que, para una gran cantidad de distribuciones de uso común, la oferta global óptima consiste en como máximo dos valores diferentes. Los resultados informados aquí se basan en la siguiente configuración.8 Para enfatizar que las valoraciones son discretas, utilizamos valores enteros que varían de 1 a 1000. Cada valoración ocurre con igual probabilidad, equivalente a una distribución de valoración uniforme en el caso continuo. Un postor puede seleccionar entre 300 niveles de oferta igualmente espaciados por iguales. Por lo tanto, un postor con valoración v puede colocar las ofertas b ∈ {0, v/300, 2V/300 ,..., V}. Los postores locales son estáticos y ofertan su valoración como antes. El conjunto inicial de funciones puede desempeñar un papel importante en los experimentos. Por lo tanto, para garantizar que nuestros resultados sean robustos, los experimentos se repiten con diferentes funciones iniciales aleatorias.5.3 Los resultados primero, describimos los resultados sin postores locales. Para este caso, encontramos que la simulación no converge a un estado estable. Es decir, cuando hay al menos otro postor mundial, la mejor estrategia de respuesta sigue fluctuando, independientemente del número de iteraciones y del estado inicial. Sin embargo, las fluctuaciones muestran un patrón distinto y alternativas entre dos estados. La Figura 2 muestra estos dos estados para Ng = 10 y M = 5. Los dos estados varían más cuando hay al menos tantas subastas como los postores globales. En ese caso, uno de los mejores estados de respuesta es ofertar con sinceridad en una subasta y cero en todos los demás. La mejor respuesta a eso, sin embargo, es ofertar una cantidad positiva igual de cero en todas las subastas;Esta estrategia garantiza al menos un objeto a un pago muy bajo. La mejor respuesta es volver a ofertar sinceramente en una sola subasta, ya que esto se apropia del objeto en esa subasta particular. Como resultado, no existe una solución estable. El mismo resultado se observa cuando el número de postores globales es menor que el número de subastas. Este OC6 Este enfoque es similar a un proceso de respuesta mejor alterno con estrategias puras [4], aunque aquí consideramos estrategias simétricas dentro de un entorno donde la mejor respuesta de los oponentes depende de su valoración.7 Tenga en cuenta que el número de posibles asignaciones aún aumenta con el número de subastas y ofertas globales. Sin embargo, al fusionar todas las permutaciones equivalentes de utilidad, aumentamos significativamente la velocidad de cálculo, permitiendo que se realicen experimentos con un número relativamente grande de subastas y licitadores (por ejemplo, una sola iteración con 50 subastas y 10 licitadores globales toma aproximadamente 30 segundos en un 3.00 GHz de 3.00 GHzORDENADOR PERSONAL).8 También realizamos experimentos con diferentes precisiones, otras distribuciones de valoración y postores locales dinámicos. Encontramos que las conclusiones principales se generalizan a estos diferentes entornos y, por lo tanto, omitimos los resultados para evitar la repetitividad.284 El sexto intl.

Las barras de error muestran las desviaciones estándar (pequeñas).Curs desde que los postores globales al azar sobre subastas y, por lo tanto, no pueden coordinar y elegir ofertar en diferentes subastas. Como se muestra en la Figura 2, se observa una fluctuación similar cuando el número de licitadores globales aumenta en relación con el número de subastas. Sin embargo, las ofertas en el estado de igualdad de ofertas iguales (estado 2 en la Figura 2), así como las bajas ofertas del otro estado, aumentan. Además, si el número de licitadores globales aumenta aún más, una bifurcación ocurre en el estado de igualdad de igualdad similar al caso sin licitadores locales. Ahora consideramos las mejores estrategias de respuesta cuando los licitadores locales y globales participan y cada subasta contiene el mismo número de licitadores locales. Para este fin, la Figura 3 muestra la varianza promedio de las mejores estrategias de respuesta. Esto se mide como la varianza de una oferta real real de respuesta sobre diferentes iteraciones, y luego tomando el promedio sobre las valoraciones discretas del postor. Aquí, la varianza es un medidor para la cantidad de fluctuación y, por lo tanto, la inestabilidad de la estrategia. Como se puede ver en esta cifra, los postores locales tienen un gran efecto estabilizador en las estrategias globales de los postor. Como resultado, la mejor estrategia de respuesta se aproxima a un equilibrio de NASH simétrico puro. Observamos que los resultados convergen después de solo unas pocas iteraciones. Los resultados muestran que las principales conclusiones en el caso de un solo postor global se trasladan al caso de múltiples postores globales. Es decir, la estrategia óptima es ofertar positiva en todas las subastas (siempre que haya al menos tantos postores como las subastas). Además, se observa un punto de bifurcación similar. Estos resultados son muy sólidos para los cambios en la configuración de la subasta y los parámetros de la simulación. Para concluir, a pesar de que un análisis teórico resulta difícil en el caso de varios licitadores mundiales, podemos aproximar un equilibrio NASH (simétrico) para entornos específicos utilizando una simulación discreta en caso de que el sistema consista en licitadores locales y globales. Por lo tanto, nuestra simulación se puede utilizar como una herramienta para predecir el equilibrio del mercado y encontrar la estrategia de licitación óptima para entornos prácticos donde esperamos una combinación de licitadores locales y globales.6. La eficiencia de la eficiencia del mercado es una propiedad importante en todo el sistema, ya que caracteriza en qué medida el mercado maximiza el bienestar social (es decir, la suma de los servicios públicos de todos los agentes en el mercado). Con este fin, en esta sección estudiamos la eficiencia de los mercados con licitadores locales estáticos o dinámicos, y el impacto que tiene un postor global sobre la eficiencia en estos mercados. Específicamente, la eficiencia en este contexto se maximiza cuando los licitadores con las valoras más altas en todo el mercado obtienen un solo artículo cada uno. Más formalmente, definimos la eficiencia de una asignación como: definición 1 eficiencia de asignación. La eficiencia ηk de una asignación k es el bienestar social obtenido proporcional al bienestar social máximo que se puede lograr en el mercado y está dado por: ηk = nt i = 1 vi (k) nt i = 1 vi (k ∗),(15) Donde k ∗ = arg maxk∈K nt i = 1 vi (k) es una asignación eficiente, k es el conjunto de todas las asignaciones posibles, vi (k) es el postor es la utilidad para la asignación k ∈ K, y ntes el número total de postores que participan en todas las subastas (incluidos los licitadores globales). Ahora, para medir la eficiencia del mercado y el impacto de un postor global, ejecutamos simulaciones para los mercados con los diferentes tipos de postores locales. Los experimentos se llevan a cabo de la siguiente manera. La valoración de cada licitador se extrae de una distribución uniforme con soporte [0, 1]. Los postores locales ofertan sus verdaderas valoraciones, mientras que el postor global ofrece de manera óptima en cada subasta como se describe en la Sección 4.3. Los experimentos se repiten 5000 veces para cada ejecución para obtener un valor medio preciso, y los resultados promedio finales y las desviaciones estándar se toman más de 10 corridas para obtener resultados estadísticamente significativos. Los resultados de estos experimentos se muestran en la Figura 4. Tenga en cuenta que un grado de ineficiencia es inherente a un mercado de múltiples múltiples con solo licitadores locales [2] .9 Por ejemplo, si hay dos subastas que venden un artículo cada uno, y los dos licitadores con las valoraciones más altas ofertan localmente en la misma subasta,entonces el postor con el segundo valor más alto no obtiene el bien. Por lo tanto, la asignación de artículos a los postores es ineficiente. Sin embargo, como se puede observar en la Figura 4, la eficiencia aumenta cuando N se hace más grande. Esto se debe a que las diferencias entre los postores con las valoraciones más altas se vuelven más pequeñas, disminuyendo así la pérdida de eficiencia. Además, la Figura 4 muestra que la presencia de un postor global tiene un efecto ligeramente positivo en la eficiencia en caso de que los licitadores locales estén estáticos. Sin embargo, en el caso de los postores dinámicos, el efecto de un postor global depende del número de vendedores. Si M es bajo (es decir, para M = 2), un postor global aumenta significativamente la eficiencia, especialmente para valores bajos de 9 excepciones triviales es cuando M = 1 o n = 1 y los licitadores son estáticos, ya que el mercado es completamenteeficiente sin un postor global.

Las barras de error indican la desviación estándar en las 10 corridas. N. Para M = 6, por otro lado, la presencia de un postor global tiene un efecto negativo en la eficiencia (este efecto se vuelve aún más pronunciado para valores más altos de M). Este resultado se explica de la siguiente manera. La introducción de un postor global potencialmente conduce a una disminución de la eficiencia, ya que este postor puede ganar involuntariamente más de un artículo. Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta el número de postores locales, es menos probable que suceda. Más bien, dado que el postor global aumenta el número de postores, su presencia hace una contribución general positiva (aunque pequeña) en caso de postores estáticos. Sin embargo, en un mercado con postores dinámicos, la eficiencia del mercado depende de otros dos factores. Por un lado, la eficiencia aumenta ya que los elementos ya no permanecen sin vender (esta situación puede ocurrir en el modelo dinámico cuando ningún postor aparece en una subasta). Por otro lado, como resultado de la incertidumbre sobre el número real de postores, es más probable que un postor global gane múltiples elementos (confirmamos esto analíticamente). A medida que M aumenta, el primer efecto se vuelve insignificante, mientras que el segundo se vuelve más prominente, reduciendo la eficiencia en promedio. Para concluir, el impacto de un postor global en la eficiencia depende claramente de la información disponible. En el caso de los postores locales estáticos, se conoce el número de postores y el postor global puede ofertar con mayor precisión. Sin embargo, en caso de incertidumbre, es más probable que el postor global gane más de un elemento, disminuyendo la eficiencia general.7. Conclusiones En este documento, obtenemos estrategias de maximización de servicios públicos para licitar múltiples subastas simultáneas de segundo precio. Primero analizamos el caso en el que un solo postor global oferta en todas las subastas, mientras que todos los demás postores son locales y ofertan en una sola subasta. Para esta configuración, encontramos el resultado contradictorio de que es óptimo colocar ofertas no cero en todas las subastas que venden el artículo deseado, incluso cuando un postor solo requiere un solo artículo y no obtiene ningún beneficio adicional de tener más. Por lo tanto, un comprador potencial puede lograr un beneficio considerable al participar en múltiples subastas y emplear una estrategia de licitación óptima. Para una serie de distribuciones de valoración comunes, mostramos analíticamente que el problema de encontrar ofertas óptimas se reduce a dos dimensiones. Esto simplifica considerablemente el problema de optimización original y, por lo tanto, se puede usar en la práctica para calcular las ofertas óptimas para cualquier número de subastas. Además, investigamos un entorno con múltiples postores globales mediante la combinación de soluciones analíticas con un enfoque de simulación. Encontramos que una estrategia de licitadores globales no se estabiliza cuando solo los postores globales están presentes en el mercado, sino que solo converge cuando también hay postores locales. Sin embargo, argumentamos que es probable que los mercados del mundo real contengan los postores locales y globales. Los resultados convergentes son muy similares a la configuración con un solo postor global, y encontramos que un postor se beneficia de manera óptima en múltiples subastas. Para la configuración más compleja con múltiples postores globales, la simulación se puede utilizar para encontrar estas ofertas para casos específicos. Finalmente, comparamos la eficiencia de un mercado con múltiples subastas concurrentes con y sin un postor global. Mostramos que, si el postor puede predecir con precisión el número de licitadores locales en cada subasta, la eficiencia aumenta ligeramente. Por el contrario, si hay mucha incertidumbre, la eficiencia disminuye significativamente a medida que aumenta el número de subastas debido a la mayor probabilidad de que un postor global gane más de dos elementos. Estos resultados muestran que la forma en que la eficiencia y, por lo tanto, el bienestar social, se ve afectado por un postor global depende de la información que esté disponible para ese postor global. En el trabajo futuro, tenemos la intención de extender los resultados a sustitutos imperfectos (es decir, cuando un postor global gana al ganar artículos adicionales) y a configuraciones donde las subastas ya no son idénticas. Este último surge, por ejemplo, cuando el número de licitadores locales (promedio) difiere por subasta o las subastas tienen diferentes configuraciones para parámetros como el precio de reserva.8.

        "Bidding Optimally in Concurrent Second-Price Auctions of Perfectly Substitutable Goods Enrico H. Gerding, Rajdeep K. Dash, David C. K. Yuen and Nicholas R. Jennings University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.",
        "{eg,rkd,dy,nrj}@ecs.soton.ac.uk ABSTRACT We derive optimal bidding strategies for a global bidding agent that participates in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions with perfect substitutes.",
        "We first consider a model where all other bidders are local and participate in a single auction.",
        "For this case, we prove that, assuming free disposal, the global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions, irrespective of the local bidders valuation distribution.",
        "Furthermore, for non-decreasing valuation distributions, we prove that the problem of finding the optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.",
        "These results hold both in the case where the number of local bidders is known and when this number is determined by a Poisson distribution.",
        "This analysis extends to online markets where, typically, auctions occur both concurrently and sequentially.",
        "In addition, by combining analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that similar results hold in the case of several global bidders, provided that the market consists of both global and local bidders.",
        "Finally, we address the efficiency of the overall market, and show that information about the number of local bidders is an important determinant for the way in which a global bidder affects efficiency.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Multiagent systems; J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Economics 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
        "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
        "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
        "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
        "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
        "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
        "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
        "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
        "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
        "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
        "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
        "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
        "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
        "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
        "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
        "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
        "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",
        "In fact it fluctuates between two states.",
        "If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the bidders and the auctions in more detail.",
        "In Section 4 we investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for it.",
        "Section 5 considers the case with multiple global bidders and in Section 6 we address the market efficiency.",
        "Finally, Section 7 concludes. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
        "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
        "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
        "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
        "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
        "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
        "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
        "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
        "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
        "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
        "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
        "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
        "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
        "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
        "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
        "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
        "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
        "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
        "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
        "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
        "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
        "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
        "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
        "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
        "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
        "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
        "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
        "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
        "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
        "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
        "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
        "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
        "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
        "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
        "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
        "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
        "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) participate in auctions that they are already familiar with.",
        "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
        "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
        "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
        "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
        "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
        "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
        "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
        "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
        "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",
        "The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4.",
        "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
        "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
        "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
        "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
        "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
        "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
        "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
        "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
        "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
        "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
        "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
        "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
        "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
        "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
        "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
        "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
        "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
        "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
        "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
        "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
        "This concludes our proof.",
        "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
        "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",
        "More formally, Theorem 1 Consider a global bidder with valuation 0 < v < vmax and global bid B, where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ B.",
        "Suppose B contains no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}, then there exists a bj > 0 such that U(B∪{bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
        "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 281 Let bj = , where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive value.",
        "Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0).",
        "Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0.",
        "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
        "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
        "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
        "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
        "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
        "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
        "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
        "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
        "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
        "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
        "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",
        "Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow.",
        "More formally: Theorem 2 Suppose the probability density function f is non-decreasing within the range [0, vmax], then the following proposition holds: given v > 0, for any bi ∈ B, either bi = bhigh, bi = blow, or bi = bhigh = blow.",
        "Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns.",
        "Now, by combining these equations, we obtain the following relationship: b1(1 − G(b1)) = b2(1 − G(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − G(bm)).",
        "By defining H(b) = b(1 − G(b)) we can rewrite the equation to: H(b1) = H(b2) = . . . = H(bm) = v bj ∈B (1 − G(bj )) (7) In order to prove that there exist at most two different bids, it is sufficient to show that b = H−1 (y) has at most two solutions that satisfy 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax for any y.",
        "To see this, suppose H−1 (y) has two solutions but there exists a third bid bj = blow = bhigh.",
        "From equation 7 it then follows that there exists a y such that H(bj) = H(blow) = H(bhigh) = y.",
        "Therefore, H−1 (y) must have at least three solutions, which is a contradiction.",
        "Now, note that, in order to prove that H−1 (y) has at most two solutions, it is necessary and sufficient to show that H(b) has at most one local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax.",
        "A sufficient conditions, however, is for H(b) to be strictly concave4 .",
        "The function H is strictly concave if and only if the following condition holds: H (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − G(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where H (b) = d2 H/db2 .",
        "By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db.",
        "Since both f and F are positive, conditions 9 and 10 clearly hold for f (b) ≥ 0.",
        "In other words, conditions 9 and 10 show that H(b) is strictly concave when the probability density function is non-decreasing for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, completing our proof.",
        "Note from conditions 9 and 10 that the requirement of non-decreasing density functions is sufficient, but far from necessary.",
        "Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions.",
        "As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases.",
        "Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other.",
        "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",
        "Furthermore, note that, if Mlow = 1 or Mhigh = 1, equation 6 can be used directly to find the desired value.",
        "Using the above, we are able to reduce the bid search space to a single continuous dimension, given Mlow or Mhigh.",
        "However, we do not know the number of auctions in which to bid blow and bhigh, and thus we need to search M different combinations to find the optimal global bid.",
        "Moreover, for each 4 More precisely, H(b) can be either strictly convex or strictly concave.",
        "However, it is easy to see that H is not convex since H(0) = H(vmax) = 0, and H(b) ≥ 0 for 0 < b < vmax. 282 The Sixth Intl.",

        "Therefore, in order to find the optimal bid for a bidder with valuation v, it is sufficient to search along one continuous variable blow ∈ [0, v], and a discrete variable Mlow = M − Mhigh ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}. 4.3.2 Empirical Evaluation In this section, we present results from an empirical study and characterise the optimal global bid for specific cases.",
        "Furthermore, we measure the actual utility improvement that can be obtained when using the global strategy.",
        "The results presented here are based on a uniform distribution of the valuations with vmax = 1, and the static local bidder model, but they generalise to the dynamic model and other distributions (not shown due to space limitations).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected utility for various M and N = 5, but again the bid curves for different values of M and N follow a very similar pattern.",
        "Here, the bid is normalised by the valuation v to give the bid fraction x = b/v.",
        "Note that, when x = 1, a bidder bids its true value.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, for bidders with a relatively low valuation, the optimal strategy is to submit M equal bids at, or very close to, the true value.",
        "The optimal bid fraction then gradually decreases for higher valuations.",
        "Interestingly, in most cases, placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point.",
        "A socalled pitchfork bifurcation is then observed and the optimal bids split into two values: a single high bid and M − 1 low ones.",
        "This transition is smooth for M = 2, but exhibits an abrupt jump for M ≥ 3.",
        "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
        "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
        "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
        "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
        "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
        "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",
        "In particular, we notice that a global bidder with a low valuation can improve its utility by up to M times the expected utility of bidding locally.",
        "Intuitively, this is because the chance of winning one of the auctions increases by up to a factor M, whereas the increase in the expected cost is negligible.",
        "For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction. 4.4 Sequential and Concurrent Auctions In this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding strategy to sequential auctions.",
        "Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously.",
        "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",
        "It turns out that the analysis for the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can be easily extended to include sequential auctions.",
        "In the following, the number of simultaneous auctions in round r is denoted by Mr, and the set of bids in that round by Br.",
        "As before, the analysis assumes that all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.",
        "Furthermore, we assume that the global bidders have complete knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round.",
        "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
        "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
        "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",
        "In that case, however, it is optimal to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known, thereby reducing the chance of unwittingly winning multiple items.",
        "Using this strategy, overlapping auctions effectively become sequential and can thus be analysed using the results in this section.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 283 Note that equation 13 is almost identical to equation 5 in Section 4.3, except that the valuation v is now replaced by v−Ur+1.",
        "The optimal bidding strategy can thus be found by backward induction (where UR+1 = 0) using the procedure outlined in Section 4.3. 5.",
        "MULTIPLE GLOBAL BIDDERS As argued in section 3.2, we expect a real-world market to exhibit a mix of global and local bidders.",
        "Whereas so far we assumed a single global bidder, in this section we consider a setting where multiple global bidders interact with one another and with local bidders as well.",
        "The analysis of this problem is complex, however, as the optimal bidding strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global bidders.",
        "A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy.",
        "Due to the complexity of the problem, however, here we combine a computational simulation approach with analytical results.",
        "The simulation works by iteratively finding the best response to the optimal bidding strategies in the previous iteration.",
        "If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium. 5.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In order to find a global bidders best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders.",
        "In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.",
        "Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",
        "However, we assume that the assignment of functions to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly once by each global bidder).",
        "Let Ω denote the set of all possible assignments.",
        "Each such assignment ω ∈ Ω is a (M, Ng) matrix, where each entry ωi,j identifies the function used by global bidder j in auction i.",
        "Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng .",
        "Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy.",
        "Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.",
        "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",
        "These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.",
        "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
        "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",
        "Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .",
        "This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.",
        "The results reported here are based on the following settings.8 In order to emphasize that the valuations are discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000.",
        "Each valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case.",
        "A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels.",
        "Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}.",
        "The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before.",
        "The initial set of functions can play an important role in the experiments.",
        "Therefore, to ensure our results are robust, experiments are repeated with different random initial functions. 5.3 The Results First, we describe the results with no local bidders.",
        "For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.",
        "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
        "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",
        "Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5.",
        "The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.",
        "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
        "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
        "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",
        "As a result, there exists no stable solution.",
        "The same result is observed when the number of global bidders is less than the number of auctions.",
        "This oc6 This approach is similar to an alternating-move bestresponse process with pure strategies [4], although here we consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an opponents best response depends on its valuation. 7 Note that the number of possible allocations still increases with the number of auctions and global bids.",
        "However, by merging all utility-equivalent permutations, we significantly increase computation speed, allowing experiments with relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed (e.g., a single iteration with 50 auctions and 10 global bidders takes roughly 30 seconds on a 3.00 Ghz PC). 8 We also performed experiments with different precision, other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders.",
        "We find that the prinicipal conclusions generalise to these different settings, and therefore we omit the results to avoid repetitiveness. 284 The Sixth Intl.",

        "The errorbars show the (small) standard deviations. curs since global bidders randomise over auctions, and thus they cannot coordinate and choose to bid high in different auctions.",
        "As shown in Figure 2, a similar fluctuation is observed when the number of global bidders increases relative to the number of auctions.",
        "However, the bids in the equal-bid state (state 2 in Figure 2), as well as the low bids of the other state, increase.",
        "Moreover, if the number of global bidders is increased even further, a bifurcation occurs in the equal-bid state similar to the case without local bidders.",
        "We now consider the best response strategies when both local and global bidders participate and each auction contains the same number of local bidders.",
        "To this end, Figure 3 shows the average variance of the best response strategies.",
        "This is measured as the variance of an actual best-response bid over different iterations, and then taking the average over the discrete bidder valuations.",
        "Here, the variance is a gauge for the amount of fluctuation and thus the instability of the strategy.",
        "As can be seen from this figure, local bidders have a large stabilising effect on the global bidder strategies.",
        "As a result, the best response strategy approximates a pure symmetric Nash equilibrium.",
        "We note that the results converge after only a few iterations.",
        "The results show that the principal conclusions in the case of a single global bidder carry over to the case of multiple global bidders.",
        "That is, the optimal strategy is to bid positive in all auctions (as long as there are at least as many bidders as auctions).",
        "Furthermore, a similar bifurcation point is observed.",
        "These results are very robust to changes to the auction settings and the parameters of the simulation.",
        "To conclude, even though a theoretical analysis proves difficult in case of several global bidders, we can approximate a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium for specific settings using a discrete simulation in case the system consists of both local and global bidders.",
        "Thus, our simulation can be used as a tool to predict the market equilibrium and to find the optimal bidding strategy for practical settings where we expect a combination of local and global bidders. 6.",
        "MARKET EFFICIENCY Efficiency is an important system-wide property since it characterises to what extent the market maximises social welfare (i.e. the sum of utilities of all agents in the market).",
        "To this end, in this section we study the efficiency of markets with either static or dynamic local bidders, and the impact that a global bidder has on the efficiency in these markets.",
        "Specifically, efficiency in this context is maximised when the bidders with the M highest valuations in the entire market obtain a single item each.",
        "More formally, we define the efficiency of an allocation as: Definition 1 Efficiency of Allocation.",
        "The efficiency ηK of an allocation K is the obtained social welfare proportional to the maximum social welfare that can be achieved in the market and is given by: ηK = NT i=1 vi(K) NT i=1 vi(K∗) , (15) where K∗ = arg maxK∈K NT i=1 vi(K) is an efficient allocation, K is the set of all possible allocations, vi(K) is bidder is utility for the allocation K ∈ K, and NT is the total number of bidders participating across all auctions (including any global bidders).",
        "Now, in order to measure the efficiency of the market and the impact of a global bidder, we run simulations for the markets with the different types of local bidders.",
        "The experiments are carried out as follows.",
        "Each bidders valuation is drawn from a uniform distribution with support [0, 1].",
        "The local bidders bid their true valuations, whereas the global bidder bids optimally in each auction as described in Section 4.3.",
        "The experiments are repeated 5000 times for each run to obtain an accurate mean value, and the final average results and standard deviations are taken over 10 runs in order to get statistically significant results.",
        "The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.",
        "Note that a degree of inefficiency is inherent to a multiauction market with only local bidders [2].9 For example, if there are two auctions selling one item each, and the two bidders with the highest valuations both bid locally in the same auction, then the bidder with the second-highest value does not obtain the good.",
        "Thus, the allocation of items to bidders is inefficient.",
        "As can be observed from Figure 4, however, the efficiency increases when N becomes larger.",
        "This is because the differences between the bidders with the highest valuations become smaller, thereby decreasing the loss of efficiency.",
        "Furthermore, Figure 4 shows that the presence of a global bidder has a slightly positive effect on the efficiency in case the local bidders are static.",
        "In the case of dynamic bidders, however, the effect of a global bidder depends on the number of sellers.",
        "If M is low (i.e., for M = 2), a global bidder significantly increases the efficiency, especially for low values of 9 Trivial exceptions are when either M = 1 or N = 1 and bidders are static, since the market is then completely efficient without a global bidder.",

        "N. For M = 6, on the other hand, the presence of a global bidder has a negative effect on the efficiency (this effect becomes even more pronounced for higher values of M).",
        "This result is explained as follows.",
        "The introduction of a global bidder potentially leads to a decrease of efficiency since this bidder can unwittingly win more than one item.",
        "However, as the number of local bidders increase, this is less likely to happen.",
        "Rather, since the global bidder increases the number of bidders, its presence makes an overall positive (albeit small) contribution in case of static bidders.",
        "In a market with dynamic bidders, however, the market efficiency depends on two other factors.",
        "On the one hand, the efficiency increases since items no longer remain unsold (this situation can occur in the dynamic model when no bidder turns up at an auction).",
        "On the other hand, as a result of the uncertainty concerning the actual number of bidders, a global bidder is more likely to win multiple items (we confirmed this analytically).",
        "As M increases, the first effect becomes negligible whereas the second one becomes more prominent, reducing the efficiency on average.",
        "To conclude, the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency clearly depends on the information that is available.",
        "In case of static local bidders, the number of bidders is known and the global bidder can bid more accurately.",
        "In case of uncertainty, however, the global bidder is more likely to win more than one item, decreasing the overall efficiency. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we derive utility-maximising strategies for bidding in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions.",
        "We first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in all auctions, whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.",
        "For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more.",
        "Thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy.",
        "For a number of common valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.",
        "This considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions.",
        "Furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation approach.",
        "We find that a global bidders strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well.",
        "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
        "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",
        "For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.",
        "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",
        "We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.",
        "In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.",
        "These results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder.",
        "In future work, we intend to extend the results to imperfect substitutes (i.e., when a global bidder gains from winning additional items), and to settings where the auctions are no longer identical.",
        "The latter arises, for example, when the number of (average) local bidders differs per auction or the auctions have different settings for parameters such as the reserve price. 8.",

                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",

                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",

                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",

                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",

                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",

                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",

                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",

                "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",

                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",

                "The function H is strictly concave if and only if the following condition holds: H (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − G(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where H (b) = d2 H/db2 .",
                "By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db.",

                "Note from conditions 9 and 10 that the requirement of non-decreasing density functions is sufficient, but far from necessary.",
                "Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions.",
                "As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases.",
                "Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other.",
                "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",

                "As shown in Figure 1, for bidders with a relatively low valuation, the optimal strategy is to submit M equal bids at, or very close to, the true value.",
                "The optimal bid fraction then gradually decreases for higher valuations.",
                "Interestingly, in most cases, placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point.",
                "A socalled pitchfork bifurcation is then observed and the optimal bids split into two values: a single high bid and M − 1 low ones.",
                "This transition is smooth for M = 2, but exhibits an abrupt jump for M ≥ 3.",
                "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
                "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
                "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",

                "For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction. 4.4 Sequential and Concurrent Auctions In this section we extend our analysis of the <br>optimal bidding strategy</br> to sequential auctions.",
                "Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously.",
                "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",
                "It turns out that the analysis for the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can be easily extended to include sequential auctions.",

                "As before, the analysis assumes that all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.",
                "Furthermore, we assume that the global bidders have complete knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round.",
                "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",
                "In that case, however, it is optimal to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known, thereby reducing the chance of unwittingly winning multiple items.",

                "The analysis of this problem is complex, however, as the <br>optimal bidding strategy</br> of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global bidders.",
                "A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy.",

                "In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.",
                "Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",

                "Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.",
                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",
                "These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.",
                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
                "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",
                "Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .",
                "This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.",

                "For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.",
                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
                "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",
                "Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5.",
                "The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.",
                "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
                "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",

                "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
                "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",
                "The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4.",
                "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
                "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
                "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
                "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
                "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
                "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
                "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
                "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
                "This concludes our proof.",
                "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
                "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",
                "More formally, Theorem 1 Consider a global bidder with valuation 0 < v < vmax and global bid B, where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ B.",
                "Suppose B contains no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}, then there exists a bj > 0 such that U(B∪{bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 281 Let bj = , where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive value.",
                "Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0).",
                "Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0.",
                "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
                "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
                "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
                "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",
                "Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow.",

                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",

                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",

                "A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels.",
                "Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}.",

                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",

                "To conclude, the impact of a global bidder on the efficiency clearly depends on the information that is available.",
                "In case of static local bidders, the number of bidders is known and the global bidder can bid more accurately.",
                "In case of uncertainty, however, the global bidder is more likely to win more than one item, decreasing the overall efficiency. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we derive utility-maximising strategies for bidding in multiple, simultaneous second-price auctions.",
                "We first analyse the case where a single global bidder bids in all auctions, whereas all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.",
                "For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more.",
                "Thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy.",
                "For a number of common valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.",
                "This considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions.",
                "Furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation approach.",
                "We find that a global bidders strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well.",
                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",
                "For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.",
                "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",
                "We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.",
                "In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.",
                "These results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder.",
                "In future work, we intend to extend the results to imperfect substitutes (i.e., when a global bidder gains from winning additional items), and to settings where the auctions are no longer identical.",
                "The latter arises, for example, when the number of (average) local bidders differs per auction or the auctions have different settings for parameters such as the reserve price. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",
                "In fact it fluctuates between two states.",
                "If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) participate in auctions that they are already familiar with.",
                "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
                "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",
                "The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4.",
                "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
                "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
                "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
                "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
                "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
                "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
                "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
                "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
                "This concludes our proof.",
                "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
                "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",

                "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",

                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",

                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",

                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",

                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",

                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",

                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",

                "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
                "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
                "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",

                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",
                "For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.",
                "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",

                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",

                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",

                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",

                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",

                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",

                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",

                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",

                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
                "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",

                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",

                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",

                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",

                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",

                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",

                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",

                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",

                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",

                "By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db.",

                "Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions.",
                "As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases.",
                "Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other.",
                "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",

                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",
                "In particular, we notice that a global bidder with a low valuation can improve its utility by up to M times the expected utility of bidding locally.",

                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",
                "In fact it fluctuates between two states.",
                "If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.",

                "Section 2 discusses related work.",
                "In Section 3 we describe the bidders and the auctions in more detail.",
                "In Section 4 we investigate the case with a single global bidder and characterise the optimal bidding behaviour for it.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant <br>market efficiency</br>.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
                "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",
                "The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4.",
                "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
                "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
                "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
                "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
                "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
                "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
                "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
                "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",

                "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",

                "Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0).",
                "Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0.",
                "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
                "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
                "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
                "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",

                "Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns.",
                "Now, by combining these equations, we obtain the following relationship: b1(1 − G(b1)) = b2(1 − G(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − G(bm)).",

                "The function H is strictly concave if and only if the following condition holds: H (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − G(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where H (b) = d2 H/db2 .",
                "By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db.",
                "Since both f and F are positive, conditions 9 and 10 clearly hold for f (b) ≥ 0.",

                "Note from conditions 9 and 10 that the requirement of non-decreasing density functions is sufficient, but far from necessary.",
                "Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions.",
                "As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases.",
                "Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other.",
                "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",
                "Furthermore, note that, if Mlow = 1 or Mhigh = 1, equation 6 can be used directly to find the desired value.",

                "A socalled pitchfork bifurcation is then observed and the optimal bids split into two values: a single high bid and M − 1 low ones.",
                "This transition is smooth for M = 2, but exhibits an abrupt jump for M ≥ 3.",
                "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
                "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
                "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",
                "In particular, we notice that a global bidder with a low valuation can improve its utility by up to M times the expected utility of bidding locally.",
                "Intuitively, this is because the chance of winning one of the auctions increases by up to a factor M, whereas the increase in the expected cost is negligible.",
                "For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction. 4.4 Sequential and Concurrent Auctions In this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding strategy to sequential auctions.",
                "Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously.",
                "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",
                "It turns out that the analysis for the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can be easily extended to include sequential auctions.",
                "In the following, the number of simultaneous auctions in round r is denoted by Mr, and the set of bids in that round by Br.",
                "As before, the analysis assumes that all other bidders are local and bid in a single auction.",
                "Furthermore, we assume that the global bidders have complete knowledge about the number of rounds and the number of auctions in each round.",
                "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",
                "In that case, however, it is optimal to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known, thereby reducing the chance of unwittingly winning multiple items.",
                "Using this strategy, overlapping auctions effectively become sequential and can thus be analysed using the results in this section.",

                "The analysis of this problem is complex, however, as the optimal bidding strategy of a global bidder depends on the strategy of other global bidders.",
                "A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, however, here we combine a computational simulation approach with analytical results.",

                "If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium. 5.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In order to find a global bidders best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders.",
                "In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.",
                "Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",
                "However, we assume that the assignment of functions to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly once by each global bidder).",
                "Let Ω denote the set of all possible assignments.",
                "Each such assignment ω ∈ Ω is a (M, Ng) matrix, where each entry ωi,j identifies the function used by global bidder j in auction i.",
                "Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng .",
                "Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy.",
                "Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.",
                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",
                "These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.",
                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
                "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",
                "Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .",
                "This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.",
                "The results reported here are based on the following settings.8 In order to emphasize that the valuations are discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000.",
                "Each valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case.",
                "A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels.",
                "Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}.",
                "The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before.",
                "The initial set of functions can play an important role in the experiments.",

                "For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.",
                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
                "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",
                "Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5.",
                "The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.",
                "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
                "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",
                "As a result, there exists no stable solution.",

                "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are <br>perfect substitute</br>s.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and <br>perfect substitute</br>s.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",
                "In fact it fluctuates between two states.",
                "If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) participate in auctions that they are already familiar with.",
                "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
                "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",
                "The global strategy, however, can be effectively executed by autonomous agents since they can gather data from many auctions and perform the required calculations within the desired time frame. 4.",
                "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
                "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
                "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
                "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
                "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
                "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
                "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
                "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
                "This concludes our proof.",
                "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
                "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",
                "More formally, Theorem 1 Consider a global bidder with valuation 0 < v < vmax and global bid B, where bi ≤ v for all bi ∈ B.",
                "Suppose B contains no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}, then there exists a bj > 0 such that U(B∪{bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 281 Let bj = , where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive value.",
                "Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0).",
                "Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0.",
                "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
                "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
                "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
                "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",
                "Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow.",
                "More formally: Theorem 2 Suppose the probability density function f is non-decreasing within the range [0, vmax], then the following proposition holds: given v > 0, for any bi ∈ B, either bi = bhigh, bi = blow, or bi = bhigh = blow.",
                "Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns.",
                "Now, by combining these equations, we obtain the following relationship: b1(1 − G(b1)) = b2(1 − G(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − G(bm)).",
                "By defining H(b) = b(1 − G(b)) we can rewrite the equation to: H(b1) = H(b2) = . . . = H(bm) = v bj ∈B (1 − G(bj )) (7) In order to prove that there exist at most two different bids, it is sufficient to show that b = H−1 (y) has at most two solutions that satisfy 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax for any y.",
                "To see this, suppose H−1 (y) has two solutions but there exists a third bid bj = blow = bhigh.",
                "From equation 7 it then follows that there exists a y such that H(bj) = H(blow) = H(bhigh) = y.",
                "Therefore, H−1 (y) must have at least three solutions, which is a contradiction.",
                "Now, note that, in order to prove that H−1 (y) has at most two solutions, it is necessary and sufficient to show that H(b) has at most one local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax.",

                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",

                "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",

Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",

                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",

                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
                "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",

                "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",

                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",
                "For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.",
                "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",
                "We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.",
                "In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.",
                "These results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder.",

                "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",
                "In fact it fluctuates between two states.",
                "If the market consists of both local and global bidders, however, the global bidders strategy quickly reaches a stable solution and we approximate a symmetric Nash equilibrium.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a <br>vickrey auction</br>, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Secondly, bidders may simply not be aware of other auctions selling the same type of item.",
                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",
                "Thirdly, an optimal global strategy is harder to compute than a local one.",
                "An agent with bounded rationality may therefore not have the resources to compute such a strategy.",
                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",

                "A SINGLE GLOBAL BIDDER In this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the optimal bidding strategy for a global bidder, given that all other bidders are local and simply bid their true valuation.",
                "After we describe the global bidders expected utility in Section 4.1, we show in Section 4.2 that it is always optimal for a global bidder to participate in the maximum number of auctions available.",
                "In Section 4.3 we discuss how to significantly reduce the complexity of finding the optimal bids for the multi-auction problem, and we then apply these methods to find optimal strategies for specific examples.",
                "Finally, in Section 4.4 we extend our analysis to sequential auctions. 4.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In what follows, the number of sellers (auctions) is M ≥ 2 and the number of local bidders is N ≥ 1.",
                "A bidders valuation v ∈ [0, vmax] is randomly drawn from a cumulative distribution F with probability density f, where f is continuous, strictly positive and has support [0, vmax].",
                "F is assumed to be equal and common knowledge for all bidders.",
                "A global bid B is a set containing a bid bi ∈ [0, vmax] for each auction 1 ≤ i ≤ M (the bids may be different for different auctions).",
                "For ease of exposition, we introduce the cumulative distribution function for the first-order statistics G(b) = F(b)N ∈ [0, 1], denoting the probability of winning a specific auction conditional on placing bid b in this auction, and its probability density g(b) = dG(b)/db = NF(b)N−1 f(b).",
                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",
                "The right part of equation 1 corresponds to the total expected costs or payments.",
                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
                "This concludes our proof.",
                "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
                "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",

                "Suppose B contains no bid for auction j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M}, then there exists a bj > 0 such that U(B∪{bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",

                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
                "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
                "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
                "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",
                "Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow.",

                "Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns.",

                "As shown in Figure 1, for bidders with a relatively low valuation, the optimal strategy is to submit M equal bids at, or very close to, the true value.",

                "Interestingly, in most cases, placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point.",

                "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
                "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
                "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",

                "For high valuation buyers, however, the benefit is not that obvious because the chances of winning are relatively high even in case of a single auction. 4.4 Sequential and Concurrent Auctions In this section we extend our analysis of the optimal bidding strategy to sequential auctions.",
                "Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously.",
                "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",
                "It turns out that the analysis for the case of simultaneous auctions is quite general and can be easily extended to include sequential auctions.",

                "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",
                "In that case, however, it is optimal to wait and bid in the new auctions only after the outcome of the earlier auctions is known, thereby reducing the chance of unwittingly winning multiple items.",

                "A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy.",

                "If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium. 5.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In order to find a global bidders best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders.",
                "In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.",
                "Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",

                "Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng .",
                "Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy.",
                "Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.",
                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",
                "These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.",
                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
                "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",
                "Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .",
                "This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.",

                "A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels.",
                "Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}.",

                "For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.",
                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
                "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",
                "Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5.",
                "The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.",
                "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
                "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",

                "For this setting, we find the counter-intuitive result that it is optimal to place non-zero bids in all auctions that sell the desired item, even when a bidder only requires a single item and derives no additional benefit from having more.",
                "Thus, a potential buyer can achieve considerable benefit by participating in multiple auctions and employing an optimal bidding strategy.",
                "For a number of common valuation distributions, we show analytically that the problem of finding optimal bids reduces to two dimensions.",
                "This considerably simplifies the original optimisation problem and can thus be used in practice to compute the optimal bids for any number of auctions.",
                "Furthermore, we investigate a setting with multiple global bidders by combining analytical solutions with a simulation approach.",
                "We find that a global bidders strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well.",
                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",
                "For the more complex setting with multiple global bidders, the simulation can thus be used to find these bids for specific cases.",
                "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",
                "We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.",
                "In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.",
                "These results show that the way in which the efficiency, and thus social welfare, is affected by a global bidder depends on the information that is available to that global bidder.",

                "INTRODUCTION The recent surge of interest in online auctions has resulted in an increasing number of auctions offering very similar or even identical goods and services [9, 10].",
                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",
                "Against this background, it is essential to develop bidding strategies that autonomous agents can use to operate effectively across a wide number of auctions.",
                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",
                "We choose these because they require little communication and are well known for their capacity to induce truthful bidding, which makes them suitable for many multi-agent system settings.",
                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders utilitymaximising strategy for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",

                "RELATED WORK Research in the area of simultaneous auctions can be segmented along two broad lines.",
                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",
                "Their work analyses a market consisting of couples having equal valuations that want to bid for a dresser.",
                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",
                "The space of symmetric mixed equilibrium strategies is derived for this special case, but again our result is more general.",
                "Finally, [11] considers the case of concurrent English auctions, in which he develops bidding algorithms for buyers with different risk attitudes.",
                "However, he forces the bids to be the same across auctions, which we show in this paper not always to be optimal. 3.",
                "BIDDING IN MULTIPLE AUCTIONS The model consists of M sellers, each of whom acts as an auctioneer.",
                "Each seller auctions one item; these items are complete substitutes (i.e., they are equal in terms of value and a bidder obtains no additional benefit from winning more than one item).",
                "The M auctions are executed concurrently; that is, they end simultaneously and no information about the outcome of any of the auctions becomes available until the bids are placed2 .",
                "However, we briefly address markets with both sequential and concurrent auctions in Section 4.4.",
                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",
                "This format has several advantages for an agent-based setting.",
                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",
                "Local bidders are assumed to bid according to the weakly dominant strategy and bid their true valuation3 .",
                "We consider two ways of modelling local bidders: static and dynamic.",
                "In the first model, the number of local bidders is assumed to be known and equal to N for each auction.",
                "In the latter model, on the other hand, the average number of bidders is equal to N, but the exact number is unknown and may vary for each auction.",
                "This uncertainty is modelled using a Poisson distribution (more details are provided in Section 4.1).",
                "As we will later show, a global bidder who bids optimally has a higher expected utility compared to a local bidder, even though the items are complete substitutes and a bidder only requires one of them.",
                "However, we can identify a number of compelling reasons why not all bidders would choose to bid globally.",
                "Firstly, participation costs such as entry fees and time to set up an account may encourage occasional users to 2 Although this paper focuses on sealed-bid auctions, where this is the case, the conditions are similar for last-minute bidding in English auctions such as eBay [10]. 3 Note that, since bidding the true value is optimal for local bidders irrespective of what others are bidding, their strategy is not affected by the presence of global bidders. 280 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Even if this is known, however, additional information such as the distribution of the valuations of other bidders and the number of participating bidders is required for bidding optimally across multiple auctions.",
                "This lack of expert information often drives a novice to bid locally.",

                "Lastly, even though a global bidder profits on average, such a bidder may incur a loss when inadvertently winning multiple auctions.",
                "This deters bidders who are either risk averse or have budget constraints from participating in multiple auction.",
                "As a result, in most market places we expect a combination of global and local bidders.",
                "In view of the above considerations, human buyers are more likely to bid locally.",

                "To see the latter, note that the expected payment of a single secondprice auction when bidding b equals b 0 yg(y)dy (see [6]) and is independent of the expected payments for other auctions.",
                "Clearly, equation 1 applies to the model with static local bidders, i.e., where the number of bidders is known and equal for each auction (see Section 3.2).",
                "However, we can use the same equation to model dynamic local bidders in the following way: Lemma 1 By replacing the first-order statistic G(y) with ˆG(y) = eN(F (y)−1) , (2) and the corresponding density function g(y) with ˆg(y) = d ˆG(y)/dy = N f(y)eN(F (y)−1) , equation 1 becomes the expected utility where the number of local bidders in each auction is described by a Poisson distribution with average N (i.e., where the probability that n local bidders participate is given by P(n) = Nn e−N /n!).",
                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",
                "To see this, note that not participating is equivalent to bidding zero.",
                "As a result, F (0) = 1 − p since there is a 1 − p probability that a bidder bids zero at a specific auction, and F (y) = F (0) + p F(y) since there is a probability p that a bidder bids according to the original distribution F(y).",
                "Now, the average number of participating bidders is given by N = p N. By replacing p with N/N, equation 3 becomes G (y) = (1 − N/N + (N/N)F(y))N .",
                "Note that a Poisson distribution is given by the limit of a binomial distribution.",
                "By keeping N constant and taking the limit N → ∞, we then obtain G (y) = eN(F (y)−1) = ˆG(y).",
                "This concludes our proof.",
                "The results that follow apply to both the static and dynamic model unless stated otherwise. 4.2 Participation in Multiple Auctions We now show that, for any valuation 0 < v < vmax, a utilitymaximising global bidder should always place non-zero bids in all available auctions.",
                "To prove this, we show that the expected utility increases when placing an arbitrarily small bid compared to not participating in an auction.",

                "Proof Using equation 1, the marginal expected utility for participating in an additional auction can be written as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = vG(bj ) bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj 0 yg(y)dy Now, using integration by parts, we have bj 0 yg(y) = bjG(bj)− bj 0 G(y)dy and the above equation can be rewritten as: U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) ⎡ ⎣v bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) − bj ⎤ ⎦ + bj 0 G(y)dy (4) The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 281 Let bj = , where is an arbitrarily small strictly positive value.",
                "Clearly, G(bj) and bj 0 G(y)dy are then both strictly positive (since f(y) > 0).",
                "Moreover, given that bi ≤ v < vmax for bi ∈ B and that v > 0, it follows that v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) > 0.",
                "Now, suppose bj = 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)), then U(B ∪ {bj }, v) − U(B, v) = G(bj ) 1 2 v bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) + bj 0 G(y)dy > 0 and thus U(B ∪ {bj }, v) > U(B, v).",
                "This completes our proof. 4.3 The Optimal Global Bid A general solution to the optimal global bid requires the maximisation of equation 1 in M dimensions, an arduous task, even when applying numerical methods.",
                "In this section, however, we show how to reduce the entire bid space to two dimensions in most cases (one continuous, and one discrete), thereby significantly simplifying the problem at hand.",
                "First, however, in order to find the optimal solutions to equation 1, we set the partial derivatives to zero: ∂U ∂bi = g(bi) ⎡ ⎣v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) − bi ⎤ ⎦ = 0 (5) Now, equality 5 holds either when g(bi) = 0 or when bj ∈B\\{bi}(1 − G(bj ))v − bi = 0.",
                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",
                "That is, the search space for finding the optimal bid can then be reduced to two continuous values.",
                "Let these values be bhigh and blow, where bhigh ≥ blow.",
                "More formally: Theorem 2 Suppose the probability density function f is non-decreasing within the range [0, vmax], then the following proposition holds: given v > 0, for any bi ∈ B, either bi = bhigh, bi = blow, or bi = bhigh = blow.",
                "Proof Using equation 6, we can produce M equations, one for each auction, with M unknowns.",
                "Now, by combining these equations, we obtain the following relationship: b1(1 − G(b1)) = b2(1 − G(b2)) = . . . = bm(1 − G(bm)).",
                "By defining H(b) = b(1 − G(b)) we can rewrite the equation to: H(b1) = H(b2) = . . . = H(bm) = v bj ∈B (1 − G(bj )) (7) In order to prove that there exist at most two different bids, it is sufficient to show that b = H−1 (y) has at most two solutions that satisfy 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax for any y.",
                "To see this, suppose H−1 (y) has two solutions but there exists a third bid bj = blow = bhigh.",
                "From equation 7 it then follows that there exists a y such that H(bj) = H(blow) = H(bhigh) = y.",
                "Therefore, H−1 (y) must have at least three solutions, which is a contradiction.",
                "Now, note that, in order to prove that H−1 (y) has at most two solutions, it is necessary and sufficient to show that H(b) has at most one local maximum for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax.",
                "A sufficient conditions, however, is for H(b) to be strictly concave4 .",
                "The function H is strictly concave if and only if the following condition holds: H (b) = d db (1 − b · g(b) − G(b)) = − b dg db + 2g(b) < 0 (8) where H (b) = d2 H/db2 .",
                "By performing standard calculations, we obtain the following condition for the static model: b (N − 1) f(b) F(b) + N f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (9) and similarly for the dynamic model we have: b N f(b) + f (b) f(b) > −2 for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, (10) where f (b) = df/db.",
                "Since both f and F are positive, conditions 9 and 10 clearly hold for f (b) ≥ 0.",
                "In other words, conditions 9 and 10 show that H(b) is strictly concave when the probability density function is non-decreasing for 0 ≤ b ≤ vmax, completing our proof.",
                "Note from conditions 9 and 10 that the requirement of non-decreasing density functions is sufficient, but far from necessary.",
                "Moreover, condition 8 requiring H(b) to be strictly concave is also stronger than necessary to guarantee only two solutions.",
                "As a result, in practice we find that the reduction of the search space applies to most cases.",
                "Given there are at most 2 possible bids, blow and bhigh, we can further reduce the search space by expressing one bid in terms of the other.",
                "Suppose the buyer places a bid of blow in Mlow auctions and bhigh for the remaining Mhigh = M−Mlow auctions, equation 6 then becomes: blow = v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 (1 − G(bhigh))Mhigh , and can be rearranged to give: bhigh = G−1 1 − blow v(1 − G(blow))Mlow−1 1 Mhigh (11) Here, the inverse function G−1 (·) can usually be obtained quite easily.",
                "Furthermore, note that, if Mlow = 1 or Mhigh = 1, equation 6 can be used directly to find the desired value.",
                "Using the above, we are able to reduce the bid search space to a single continuous dimension, given Mlow or Mhigh.",
                "However, we do not know the number of auctions in which to bid blow and bhigh, and thus we need to search M different combinations to find the optimal global bid.",
                "Moreover, for each 4 More precisely, H(b) can be either strictly convex or strictly concave.",
                "However, it is easy to see that H is not convex since H(0) = H(vmax) = 0, and H(b) ≥ 0 for 0 < b < vmax. 282 The Sixth Intl.",

                "The results presented here are based on a uniform distribution of the valuations with vmax = 1, and the static local bidder model, but they generalise to the dynamic model and other distributions (not shown due to space limitations).",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the optimal global bids and the corresponding expected utility for various M and N = 5, but again the bid curves for different values of M and N follow a very similar pattern.",

                "As shown in Figure 1, for bidders with a relatively low valuation, the optimal strategy is to submit M equal bids at, or very close to, the true value.",

                "Interestingly, in most cases, placing equal bids is no longer the optimal strategy after the valuation reaches a certain point.",

                "In all experiments, however, we consistently observe that the optimal strategy is always to place a high bid in one auction, and an equal or lower bid in all others.",
                "In case of a bifurcation and when the valuation approaches vmax, the optimal high bid goes to the true value and the low bids go to zero.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 1, the utility of a global bidder becomes progressively higher with more auctions.",
                "In absolute terms, the improvement is especially high for bidders that have an above average valuation, but not too close to vmax.",
                "The bidders in this range thus benefit most from bidding globally.",
                "This is because bidders with very low valuations have a very small chance of winning any auction, whereas bidders with a very high valuation have a high probability of winning a single auction and benefit less from participating in more auctions.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the utility relative to bidding in a single auction, this is much higher for bidders with relatively low valuations (this effect cannot be seen clearly in Figure 1 due to the scale).",

                "Specifically, the auction process consists of R rounds, and in each round any number of auctions are running simultaneously.",
                "Such a combination of sequential and concurrent auctions is very common in practice, especially online5 .",

                "The expected utility in round r, denoted by Ur, is similar to before (equation 1 in Section 4.1) except that now additional benefit can be obtained from future auctions if the desired item is not won in one of the current set of simultaneous auctions.",
                "For convenience, Ur(Br, Mr) is abbreviated to Ur in the following.",
                "The expected utility thus becomes: Ur = v · Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy + Ur+1 · (1 − Pr(Br)) = Ur+1 + (v − Ur+1)Pr(Br) − bri∈Br bri 0 yg(y)dy, (12) where Pr(Br) = 1 − bri∈Br (1 − G(bri)) is the probability of winning at least one auction in round r. Now, we take the partial derivative of equation 12 in order to find the optimal bid brj for auction j in round r: ∂Us ∂brj = g(brj) ⎡ ⎣(v − Us+1) bri∈Br\\{brj } (1 − G(bri)) − brj ⎤ ⎦ (13) 5 Rather than being purely sequential in nature, online auctions also often overlap (i.e., new auctions can start while others are still ongoing).",

                "A typical analytical approach is to find the symmetric Nash equilibrium solution [9, 12], which occurs when all global bidders use the same strategy to produce their bids, and no (global) bidder has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the chosen strategy.",

                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
                "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",

                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",

                "We find that a global bidders strategy does not stabilise when only global bidders are present in the market, but only converges when there are local bidders as well.",
                "We argue, however, that real-world markets are likely to contain both local and global bidders.",
                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",

                "Finally, we compare the efficiency of a market with multiple concurrent auctions with and without a global bidder.",
                "We show that, if the bidder can accurately predict the number of local bidders in each auction, the efficiency slightly increases.",
                "In contrast, if there is much uncertainty, the efficiency significantly diminishes as the number of auctions increases due to the increased probability that a global bidder wins more than two items.",

                "In eBay alone, for example, there are often hundreds or sometimes even thousands of concurrent auctions running worldwide selling such substitutable items1 .",

                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",
                "As we will show, however, this analysis is also relevant to a wider context where auctions are conducted sequentially, as well as concurrently.",
                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on simultaneous auctions for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on simultaneous auctions).",
                "In contrast, here we consider bidding strategies for markets with multiple concurrent auctions and perfect substitutes.",
                "In particular, our focus is on Vickrey or second-price sealed bid auctions.",

                "However, our results generalise to settings with English auctions since these are strategically equivalent to second-price auctions.",
                "Within this setting, we are able to characterise, for the first time, a bidders <br>utilitymaximising strategy</br> for bidding simultaneously in any number of such auctions and for any type of bidder valuation distribution.",
                "In more detail, we first consider a market where a single bidder, called the global bidder, can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the other bidders, called the local bidders, are assumed to bid only in a single auction.",
                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",
                "We then go on to consider markets with more than one global bidder.",
                "Due to the complexity of the problem, we combine analytical results with a discrete simulation in order to numerically derive the optimal bidding strategy.",
                "By so doing, we find that, in a market with only global bidders, the dynamics of the best response do not converge to a pure strategy.",

                "On the one hand, there is the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic analysis of simultaneous auctions which concentrates on studying the equilibrium strategy of rational agents [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11].",
                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",
                "This paper adopts the former approach in studying a market of M simultaneous Vickrey auctions since this approach yields provably optimal bidding strategies.",
                "In this case, the seminal paper by Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Weber provides one of the starting points for the gametheoretic analysis of distributed markets where buyers have substitutable goods.",

                "Thus, the couples bid space can at most contain two bids since the husband and wife can be at most at two geographically distributed auctions simultaneously.",
                "They derive a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the special case where the number of buyers is large.",
                "Our analysis differs from theirs in that we study concurrent auctions in which bidders have different valuations and the global bidder can bid in all the auctions concurrently (which is entirely possible given autonomous agents).",
                "Following this, [7] then studied the case of simultaneous auctions with complementary goods.",
                "They analyse the case of both local and global bidders and characterise the bidding of the buyers and resultant market efficiency.",
                "The setting provided in [7] is further extended to the case of common values in [9].",
                "However, neither of these works extend easily to the case of substitutable goods which we consider.",
                "This case is studied in [12], but the scenario considered is restricted to three sellers and two global bidders and with each bidder having the same value (and thereby knowing the value of other bidders).",

                "We also assume that all the auctions are equivalent (i.e., a bidder does not prefer one auction over another).",
                "Finally, we assume free disposal (i.e., a winner of multiple items incurs no additional costs by discarding unwanted ones) and risk neutral bidders. 3.1 The Auctions The sellers auction is implemented as a Vickrey auction, where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest price.",

                "Firstly, it is communication efficient.",
                "Secondly, for the single-auction case (i.e., where a bidder places a bid in at most one auction), the optimal strategy is to bid the true value and thus requires no computation (once the valuation of the item is known).",
                "This strategy is also weakly dominant (i.e., it is independent of the other bidders decisions), and therefore it requires no information about the preferences of other agents (such as the distribution of their valuations). 3.2 Global and Local Bidders We distinguish between global and local bidders.",
                "The former can bid in any number of auctions, whereas the latter only bid in a single one.",

                "Now, the expected utility U for a global bidder with global bid B and valuation v is given by: U(B, v) = v ⎡ ⎣1 − bi∈B (1 − G(bi)) ⎤ ⎦ − bi∈B bi 0 yg(y)dy (1) Here, the left part of the equation is the valuation multiplied by the probability that the global bidder wins at least one of the M auctions and thus corresponds to the expected benefit.",
                "In more detail, note that 1 − G(bi) is the probability of not winning auction i when bidding bi, bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of not winning any auction, and thus 1 − bi∈B(1 − G(bi)) is the probability of winning at least one auction.",

                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",

                "In the dynamic model, g(bi) is always greater than zero, and can therefore be ignored (since g(0) = Nf(0)e−N and we assume f(y) > 0).",
                "In the static model, g(bi) = 0 only when bi = 0.",
                "However, theorem 1 shows that the optimal bid is non-zero for 0 < v < vmax.",
                "Therefore, we can ignore the first part, and the second part yields: bi = v bj ∈B\\{bi} (1 − G(bj)) (6) In other words, the optimal bid in auction i is equal to the bidders valuation multiplied by the probability of not winning any of the other auctions.",
                "It is straightforward to show that the second partial derivative is negative, confirming that the solution is indeed a maximum when keeping all other bids constant.",
                "Thus, equation 6 provides a means to derive the optimal bid for auction i, given the bids in all other auctions. 4.3.1 Reducing the Search Space In what follows, we show that, for non-decreasing probability density functions (such as the uniform and logarithmic distributions), the optimal global bid consists of at most two different values for any M ≥ 2.",

                "The converged results are then very similar to the setting with a single global bidder, and we find that a bidder benefits by bidding optimally in multiple auctions.",

                "To this end, in this paper we devise and analyse optimal bidding strategies for an important yet barely studied setting - namely, an agent that participates in multiple, concurrent (i.e., simultaneous) second-price auctions for goods that are perfect substitutes.",

                "To date, much of the existing literature on multiple auctions focuses either on sequential auctions [6] or on <br>simultaneous auction</br>s for complementary goods, where the value of items together is greater than the sum of the individual items (see Section 2 for related research on <br>simultaneous auction</br>s).",

                "For this case, we find the following results: • Whereas in the case of a single second-price auction a bidders best strategy is to bid its true value, the best strategy for a global bidder is to bid below it. • We are able to prove that, even if a global bidder requires only one item, the expected utility is maximised by participating in all the auctions that are selling the desired item. • Finding the optimal bid for each auction can be an arduous task when considering all possible combinations.",
                "However, for most common bidder valuation distributions, we are able to significantly reduce this search space and thus the computation required. • Empirically, we find that a bidders expected utility is maximised by bidding relatively high in one of the auctions, and equal or lower in all other auctions.",

                "Such analyses are typically used when the auction format employed in the concurrent auctions is the same (e.g. there are M Vickrey auctions or M first-price auctions).",
                "On the other hand, heuristic strategies have been developed for more complex settings when the sellers offer different types of auctions or the buyers need to buy bundles of goods over distributed auctions [1, 13, 5].",

                "Proof To prove this, we first show that G(·) and F(·) can be modified such that the number of bidders per auction is given by a binomial distribution (where a bidders decision to participate is given by a Bernoulli trial) as follows: G (y) = F (y)N = (1 − p + p F (y))N , (3) where p is the probability that a bidder participates in the auction, and N is the total number of bidders.",

                "If this should result in a stable outcome (i.e., when the optimal bidding strategies remains unchanged for two subsequent iterations), the solution is by definition a (symmetric) Nash equilibrium. 5.1 The Global Bidders Expected Utility In order to find a global bidders best response, we first need to calculate the expected utility given the global bid B and the strategies of both the other global bidders as well as the local bidders.",
                "In the following, let Ng denote the number of other global bidders.",
                "Furthermore, let the strategies of the other global bidders be represented by the set of functions βk(v), 1 ≤ k ≤ M, producing a bid for each auction given a bidders valuation v. Note that all other global bidders use the same set of functions since we consider symmetric equilibria.",
                "However, we assume that the assignment of functions to auctions by each global bidder occurs in a random fashion without replacement (i.e., each function is assigned exactly once by each global bidder).",

                "Note that the cardinality of Ω, denoted by |Ω|, is equal to M!Ng .",
                "Now, the expected utility is the average expected utility over all possible assignments and is given by: U(B, v) = 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω v ⎛ ⎝1 − bi∈B (1 − ˜Gωi (bi)) ⎞ ⎠ − 1 |Ω| ω∈Ω bi∈B bi 0 y˜gωi (y)dy, (14) where ˜Gωi (b) = G(b) · Ng j=1 b 0 βωi,j (y)f(y)dy denotes the probability of winning auction i, given that each global bidder 1 ≤ j ≤ Ng bids according to the function βωi,j , and ˜gωi (y) = d ˜Gωi (y)/dy.",
                "Here, G(b) is the probability of winning an auction with only local bidders as described in Section 4.1, and f(y) is the probability density of the bidder valuations as before. 5.2 The Simulation The simulation works by discretising the space of possible valuations and bids and then finding a best response to an initial set of bidding functions.",
                "The best response is found by maximising equation 14 for each discrete valuation, which, in turn, results in a new set of bidding functions.",
                "These functions then affect the probabilities of winning in the next iteration for which the new best response strategy is calculated.",
                "This process is then repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stable solution has been found6 .",
                "Clearly, due to the large search space, finding the utilitymaximising global bid quickly becomes infeasible as the number of auctions and global bidders increases.",
                "Therefore, we reduce the search space by limiting the global bid to two dimensions where a global bidder bids high in one of the auctions and low in all the others7 .",
                "This simplification is justified by the results in Section 4.3.1 which show that, for a large number of commonly used distributions, the optimal global bid consist of at most two different values.",
                "The results reported here are based on the following settings.8 In order to emphasize that the valuations are discrete, we use integer values ranging from 1 to 1000.",
                "Each valuation occurs with equal probability, equivalent to a uniform valuation distribution in the continuous case.",
                "A bidder can select between 300 different equally-spaced bid levels.",
                "Thus, a bidder with valuation v can place bids b ∈ {0, v/300, 2v/300, . . . , v}.",
                "The local bidders are static and bid their valuation as before.",
                "The initial set of functions can play an important role in the experiments.",
                "Therefore, to ensure our results are robust, experiments are repeated with different random initial functions. 5.3 The Results First, we describe the results with no local bidders.",
                "For this case, we find that the simulation does not converge to a stable state.",
                "That is, when there is at least one other global bidder, the best response strategy keeps fluctuating, irrespective of the number of iterations and of the initial state.",
                "The fluctuations, however, show a distinct pattern and alternate between two states.",
                "Figure 2 depicts these two states for NG = 10 and M = 5.",
                "The two states vary most when there are at least as many auctions as there are global bidders.",
                "In that case, one of the best response states is to bid truthfully in one auction and zero in all others.",
                "The best response to that, however, is to bid an equal positive amount close to zero in all auctions; this strategy guarantees at least one object at a very low payment.",
                "The best response is then again to bid truthfully in a single auction since this appropriates the object in that particular auction.",
                "As a result, there exists no stable solution.",
                "The same result is observed when the number of global bidders is less than the number of auctions.",
                "This oc6 This approach is similar to an alternating-move bestresponse process with pure strategies [4], although here we consider symmetric strategies within a setting where an opponents best response depends on its valuation. 7 Note that the number of possible allocations still increases with the number of auctions and global bids.",
                "However, by merging all utility-equivalent permutations, we significantly increase computation speed, allowing experiments with relatively large numbers of auctions and bidders to be performed (e.g., a single iteration with 50 auctions and 10 global bidders takes roughly 30 seconds on a 3.00 Ghz PC). 8 We also performed experiments with different precision, other valuation distributions, and dynamic local bidders.",
