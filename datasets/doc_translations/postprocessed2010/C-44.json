Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and effective range of sensor devices. To overcome limitations in existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments. The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences, easily obtained through loosely guided event distribution. Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy. We address several interesting issues, such as incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the Mirage test-bed we built. We have evaluated the MSP system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 MICAz motes and an outdoor version with 20 MICAz motes). This evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution. It also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy. Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer Communications Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Design, Performance, Experimentation 1 Introduction Although Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have shown promising prospects in various applications [5], researchers still face several challenges for massive deployment of such networks. One of these is to identify the location of individual sensor nodes in outdoor environments. Because of unpredictable flow dynamics in airborne scenarios, it is not currently feasible to localize sensor nodes during massive UVA-based deployment. On the other hand, geometric information is indispensable in these networks, since users need to know where events of interest occur (e.g., the location of intruders or of a bomb explosion). Previous research on node localization falls into two categories: range-based approaches and range-free approaches. Range-based approaches [13, 17, 19, 24] compute per-node location information iteratively or recursively based on measured distances among target nodes and a few anchors which precisely know their locations. These approaches generally require costly hardware (e.g., GPS) and have limited effective range due to energy constraints (e.g., ultrasound-based TDOA [3, 17]). Although range-based solutions can be suitably used in small-scale indoor environments, they are considered less cost-effective for large-scale deployments. On the other hand, range-free approaches [4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15] do not require accurate distance measurements, but localize the node based on network connectivity (proximity) information. Unfortunately, since wireless connectivity is highly influenced by the environment and hardware calibration, existing solutions fail to deliver encouraging empirical results, or require substantial survey [2] and calibration [24] on a case-by-case basis. Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment, researchers have recently proposed solutions (e.g., Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18]) for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal correlation of controlled events (i.e., inferring nodes locations based on the detection time of controlled events). These solutions demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at sensor nodes. These benefits, however, come along with an implicit assumption that the controlled events can be precisely distributed to a specified location at a specified time. We argue that precise event distribution is difficult to achieve, especially at large scale when terrain is uneven, the event distribution device is not well calibrated and its position is difficult to maintain (e.g., the helicopter-mounted scenario in [20]). To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors. The novel idea behind MSP is to estimate each sensor nodes two-dimensional location by processing multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences (e.g., event detection order) obtained through loosely-guided event distribution. This design offers several benefits. First, compared to a range-based approach, MSP does not require additional costly hardware. It works using sensors typically used by sensor network applications, such as light and acoustic sensors, both of which we specifically consider in this work. Second, compared to a range-free approach, MSP needs only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two), so high accuracy can be achieved economically by introducing more events instead of more anchors. And third, compared to Spotlight, MSP does not require precise and sophisticated event distribution, an advantage that significantly simplifies the system design and reduces calibration cost. This paper offers the following additional intellectual contributions: • We are the first to localize sensor nodes using the concept of node sequence, an ordered list of sensor nodes, sorted by the detection time of a disseminated event. We demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly improve localization accuracy. Interestingly, we discover that repeated reprocessing of one-dimensional node sequences can further increase localization accuracy. • We propose a distribution-based location estimation strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using the marginal probability of joint distribution among adjacent nodes within the sequence. This new algorithm outperforms the widely adopted Centroid estimation [4, 8]. • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events. The generation of later events is guided by localization results from previous events. • We evaluate line-based MSP on our new Mirage test-bed, and wave-based MSP in outdoor environments. Through system implementation, we discover and address several interesting issues such as partial sequence and sequence flips. To reveal MSP performance at scale, we provide analytic results as well as a complete simulation study. All the simulation and implementation code is available online at http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/MSP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly surveys the related work. Section 3 presents an overview of the MSP localization system. In sections 4 and 5, basic MSP and four advanced processing methods are introduced. Section 6 describes how MSP can be applied in a wave propagation scenario. Section 7 discusses several implementation issues. Section 8 presents simulation results, and Section 9 reports an evaluation of MSP on the Mirage test-bed and an outdoor test-bed. Section 10 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work Many methods have been proposed to localize wireless sensor devices in the open air. Most of these can be classified into two categories: range-based and range-free localization. Range-based localization systems, such as GPS [23], Cricket [17], AHLoS [19], AOA [16], Robust Quadrilaterals [13] and Sweeps [7], are based on fine-grained point-topoint distance estimation or angle estimation to identify pernode location. Constraints on the cost, energy and hardware footprint of each sensor node make these range-based methods undesirable for massive outdoor deployment. In addition, ranging signals generated by sensor nodes have a very limited effective range because of energy and form factor concerns. For example, ultrasound signals usually effectively propagate 20-30 feet using an on-board transmitter [17]. Consequently, these range-based solutions require an undesirably high deployment density. Although the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) related [2, 24] methods were once considered an ideal low-cost solution, the irregularity of radio propagation [26] seriously limits the accuracy of such systems. The recently proposed RIPS localization system [11] superimposes two RF waves together, creating a low-frequency envelope that can be accurately measured. This ranging technique performs very well as long as antennas are well oriented and environmental factors such as multi-path effects and background noise are sufficiently addressed. Range-free methods dont need to estimate or measure accurate distances or angles. Instead, anchors or controlled-event distributions are used for node localization. Range-free methods can be generally classified into two types: anchor-based and anchor-free solutions. • For anchor-based solutions such as Centroid [4], APIT [8], SeRLoc [10], Gradient [13] , and APS [15], the main idea is that the location of each node is estimated based on the known locations of the anchor nodes. Different anchor combinations narrow the areas in which the target nodes can possibly be located. Anchor-based solutions normally require a high density of anchor nodes so as to achieve good accuracy. In practice, it is desirable to have as few anchor nodes as possible so as to lower the system cost. • Anchor-free solutions require no anchor nodes. Instead, external event generators and data processing platforms are used. The main idea is to correlate the event detection time at a sensor node with the known space-time relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection time-stamps can be mapped into the locations of sensors. Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18] work in this fashion. In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be precise in both time and space. Precise event distribution is difficult to achieve without careful calibration, especially when the event-generating devices require certain mechanical maneuvers (e.g., the telescope mount used in Spotlight). All these increase system cost and reduce localization speed. StarDust [21], which works much faster, uses label relaxation algorithms to match light spots reflected by corner-cube retro-reflectors (CCR) with sensor nodes using various constraints. Label relaxation algorithms converge only when a sufficient number of robust constraints are obtained. Due to the environmental impact on RF connectivity constraints, however, StarDust is less accurate than Spotlight. In this paper, we propose a balanced solution that avoids the limitations of both anchor-based and anchor-free solutions. Unlike anchor-based solutions [4, 8], MSP allows a flexible tradeoff between the physical cost (anchor nodes) with the soft 16 1 A B 2 3 4 5 Target nodeAnchor node 1A 5 3 B2 4 1 B2 5A 43 1A25B4 3 1 52 AB 4 3 1 2 3 5 4 (b) (c)(d) (a) Event 1 Node Sequence generated by event 1 Event 3 Node Sequence generated by event 2 Node Sequence generated by event 3 Node Sequence generated by event 4 Event 2 Event 4 Figure 1. The MSP System Overview cost (localization events). MSP uses only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two). Unlike anchor-free solutions, MSP doesnt need to maintain rigid time-space relationships while distributing events, which makes system design simpler, more flexible and more robust to calibration errors. 3 System Overview MSP works by extracting relative location information from multiple simple one-dimensional orderings of nodes. Figure 1(a) shows a layout of a sensor network with anchor nodes and target nodes. Target nodes are defined as the nodes to be localized. Briefly, the MSP system works as follows. First, events are generated one at a time in the network area (e.g., ultrasound propagations from different locations, laser scans with diverse angles). As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time instance. For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node sequence. Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b). Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)). Finally, a distributionbased estimation method estimates the exact location of each sensor node, as shown in Figure 1(d). Figure 1 shows that the node sequences can be obtained much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via ranging methods. In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]). For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: • Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9]. • Realistic Deployment, in which (i) node sequences can be partial (incomplete), (ii) elements in sequences could flip (i.e., the order obtained is reversed from reality), and (iii) nodes are not time-synchronized. To introduce the MSP algorithm, we first consider a simple straight-line scan scenario. Then, we describe how to implement straight-line scans as well as other event types, such as sound wave propagation. 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 8 1 5 A 6 C 4 3 7 2 B 9 3 1 C 5 9 2 A 4 6 B 7 8 Target node Anchor node Figure 2. Obtaining Multiple Node Sequences 4 Basic MSP Let us consider a sensor network with N target nodes and M anchor nodes randomly deployed in an area of size S. The top-level idea for basic MSP is to split the whole sensor network area into small pieces by processing node sequences. Because the exact locations of all the anchors in a node sequence are known, all the nodes in this sequence can be divided into O(M +1) parts in the area. In Figure 2, we use numbered circles to denote target nodes and numbered hexagons to denote anchor nodes. Basic MSP uses two straight lines to scan the area from different directions, treating each scan as an event. All the nodes react to the event sequentially generating two node sequences. For vertical scan 1, the node sequence is (8,1,5,A,6,C,4,3,7,2,B,9), as shown outside the right boundary of the area in Figure 2; for horizontal scan 2, the node sequence is (3,1,C,5,9,2,A,4,6,B,7,8), as shown under the bottom boundary of the area in Figure 2. Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2. To extend this process, suppose we have M anchor nodes and perform d scans from different angles, obtaining d node sequences and dividing the area into many small parts. Obviously, the number of parts is a function of the number of anchors M, the number of scans d, the anchors location as well as the slop k for each scan line. According to the pie-cutting theorem [22], the area can be divided into O(M2d2) parts. When M and d are appropriately large, the polygon for each target node may become sufficiently small so that accurate estimation can be achieved. We emphasize that accuracy is affected not only by the number of anchors M, but also by the number of events d. In other words, MSP provides a tradeoff between the physical cost of anchors and the soft cost of events. Algorithm 1 depicts the computing architecture of basic MSP. Each node sequence is processed within line 1 to 8. For each node, GetBoundaries() in line 5 searches for the predecessor and successor anchors in the sequence so as to determine the boundaries of this node. Then in line 6 UpdateMap() shrinks the location area of this node according to the newly obtained boundaries. After processing all sequences, Centroid Estimation (line 11) set the center of gravity of the final polygon as the estimated location of the target node. Basic MSP only makes use of the order information between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence. Actually, we can extract much more location information from 17 Algorithm 1 Basic MSP Process Output: The estimated location of each node. 1: repeat 2: GetOneUnprocessedSeqence(); 3: repeat 4: GetOneNodeFromSequenceInOrder(); 5: GetBoundaries(); 6: UpdateMap(); 7: until All the target nodes are updated; 8: until All the node sequences are processed; 9: repeat 10: GetOneUnestimatedNode(); 11: CentroidEstimation(); 12: until All the target nodes are estimated; each sequence. Section 5 will introduce advanced MSP, in which four novel optimizations are proposed to improve the performance of MSP significantly. 5 Advanced MSP Four improvements to basic MSP are proposed in this section. The first three improvements do not need additional sensing and communication in the networks but require only slightly more off-line computation. The objective of all these improvements is to make full use of the information embedded in the node sequences. The results we have obtained empirically indicate that the implementation of the first two methods can dramatically reduce the localization error, and that the third and fourth methods are helpful for some system deployments. 5.1 Sequence-Based MSP As shown in Figure 2, each scan line and M anchors, splits the whole area into M + 1 parts. Each target node falls into one polygon shaped by scan lines. We noted that in basic MSP, only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each target node, but actually there is more information in the node sequence that we can made use of. Lets first look at a simple example shown in Figure 3. The previous scans narrow the locations of target node 1 and node 2 into two dashed rectangles shown in the left part of Figure 3. Then a new scan generates a new sequence (1, 2). With knowledge of the scans direction, it is easy to tell that node 1 is located to the left of node 2. Thus, we can further narrow the location area of node 2 by eliminating the shaded part of node 2s rectangle. This is because node 2 is located on the right of node 1 while the shaded area is outside the lower boundary of node 1. Similarly, the location area of node 1 can be narrowed by eliminating the shaded part out of node 2s right boundary. We call this procedure sequence-based MSP which means that the whole node sequence needs to be processed node by node in order. Specifically, sequence-based MSP follows this exact processing rule: 1 2 1 2 1 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Lower boundary of 2 Upper boundary of 2 New sequence New upper boundary of 1 New Lower boundary of 2 EventPropagation Figure 3. Rule Illustration in Sequence Based MSP Algorithm 2 Sequence-Based MSP Process Output: The estimated location of each node. 1: repeat 2: GetOneUnprocessedSeqence(); 3: repeat 4: GetOneNodeByIncreasingOrder(); 5: ComputeLowbound(); 6: UpdateMap(); 7: until The last target node in the sequence; 8: repeat 9: GetOneNodeByDecreasingOrder(); 10: ComputeUpbound(); 11: UpdateMap(); 12: until The last target node in the sequence; 13: until All the node sequences are processed; 14: repeat 15: GetOneUnestimatedNode(); 16: CentroidEstimation(); 17: until All the target nodes are estimated; Elimination Rule: Along a scanning direction, the lower boundary of the successors area must be equal to or larger than the lower boundary of the predecessors area, and the upper boundary of the predecessors area must be equal to or smaller than the upper boundary of the successors area. In the case of Figure 3, node 2 is the successor of node 1, and node 1 is the predecessor of node 2. According to the elimination rule, node 2s lower boundary cannot be smaller than that of node 1 and node 1s upper boundary cannot exceed node 2s upper boundary. Algorithm 2 illustrates the pseudo code of sequence-based MSP. Each node sequence is processed within line 3 to 13. The sequence processing contains two steps: Step 1 (line 3 to 7): Compute and modify the lower boundary for each target node by increasing order in the node sequence. Each nodes lower boundary is determined by the lower boundary of its predecessor node in the sequence, thus the processing must start from the first node in the sequence and by increasing order. Then update the map according to the new lower boundary. Step 2 (line 8 to 12): Compute and modify the upper boundary for each node by decreasing order in the node sequence. Each nodes upper boundary is determined by the upper boundary of its successor node in the sequence, thus the processing must start from the last node in the sequence and by decreasing order. Then update the map according to the new upper boundary. After processing all the sequences, for each node, a polygon bounding its possible location has been found. Then, center-ofgravity-based estimation is applied to compute the exact location of each node (line 14 to 17). An example of this process is shown in Figure 4. The third scan generates the node sequence (B,9,2,7,4,6,3,8,C,A,5,1). In addition to the anchor split lines, because nodes 4 and 7 come after node 2 in the sequence, node 4 and 7s polygons could be narrowed according to node 2s lower boundary (the lower right-shaded area); similarly, the shaded area in node 2s rectangle could be eliminated since this part is beyond node 7s upper boundary indicated by the dotted line. Similar eliminating can be performed for node 3 as shown in the figure. 18 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 Straight-line Scan 3 Target node Anchor node Figure 4. Sequence-Based MSP Example 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 Straight-line Scan 3 Reprocessing Scan 1 Target node Anchor node Figure 5. Iterative MSP: Reprocessing Scan 1 From above, we can see that the sequence-based MSP makes use of the information embedded in every sequential node pair in the node sequence. The polygon boundaries of the target nodes obtained in prior could be used to further split other target nodes areas. Our evaluation in Sections 8 and 9 shows that sequence-based MSP considerably enhances system accuracy. 5.2 Iterative MSP Sequence-based MSP is preferable to basic MSP because it extracts more information from the node sequence. In fact, further useful information still remains! In sequence-based MSP, a sequence processed later benefits from information produced by previously processed sequences (e.g., the third scan in Figure 5). However, the first several sequences can hardly benefit from other scans in this way. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose iterative MSP. The basic idea of iterative MSP is to process all the sequences iteratively several times so that the processing of each single sequence can benefit from the results of other sequences. To illustrate the idea more clearly, Figure 4 shows the results of three scans that have provided three sequences. Now if we process the sequence (8,1,5,A,6,C,4,3,7,2,B,9) obtained from scan 1 again, we can make progress, as shown in Figure 5. The reprocessing of the node sequence 1 provides information in the way an additional vertical scan would. From sequencebased MSP, we know that the upper boundaries of nodes 3 and 4 along the scan direction must not extend beyond the upper boundary of node 7, therefore the grid parts can be eliminated (a) Central of Gravity (b) Joint Distribution 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 Figure 6.

From this example, we can see that iterative processing of the sequence could help further shrink the polygon of each target node, and thus enhance the accuracy of the system. The implementation of iterative MSP is straightforward: process all the sequences multiple times using sequence-based MSP. Like sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP introduces no additional event cost. In other words, reprocessing does not actually repeat the scan physically. Evaluation results in Section 8 will show that iterative MSP contributes noticeably to a lower localization error. Empirical results show that after 5 iterations, improvements become less significant. In summary, iterative processing can achieve better performance with only a small computation overhead. 5.3 Distribution-Based Estimation After determining the location area polygon for each node, estimation is needed for a final decision. Previous research mostly applied the Center of Gravity (COG) method [4] [8] [10] which minimizes average error. If every node is independent of all others, COG is the statistically best solution. In MSP, however, each node may not be independent. For example, two neighboring nodes in a certain sequence could have overlapping polygon areas. In this case, if the marginal probability of joint distribution is used for estimation, better statistical results are achieved. Figure 6 shows an example in which node 1 and node 2 are located in the same polygon. If COG is used, both nodes are localized at the same position (Figure 6(a)). However, the node sequences obtained from two scans indicate that node 1 should be to the left of and above node 2, as shown in Figure 6(b). The high-level idea of distribution-based estimation proposed for MSP, which we call DBE MSP, is illustrated in Figure 7. The distributions of each node under the ith scan (for the ith node sequence) are estimated in node.vmap[i], which is a data structure for remembering the marginal distribution over scan i. Then all the vmaps are combined to get a single map and weighted estimation is used to obtain the final location. For each scan, all the nodes are sorted according to the gap, which is the diameter of the polygon along the direction of the scan, to produce a second, gap-based node sequence. Then, the estimation starts from the node with the smallest gap. This is because it is statistically more accurate to assume a uniform distribution of the node with smaller gap. For each node processed in order from the gap-based node sequence, either if 19 Pred. nodes area Predecessor node exists: conditional distribution based on pred. nodes area Alone: Uniformly Distributed Succ. nodes area Successor node exists: conditional distribution based on succ. nodes area Succ. nodes area Both predecessor and successor nodes exist: conditional distribution based on both of them Pred. nodes area Figure 8. Four Cases in DBE Process no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence shares an overlapping area, or if the neighbors have not been processed due to bigger gaps, a uniform distribution Uniform() is applied to this isolated node (the Alone case in Figure 8). If the distribution of its neighbors sharing overlapped areas has been processed, we calculate the joint distribution for the node. As shown in Figure 8, there are three possible cases depending on whether the distribution of the overlapping predecessor and/or successor nodes have/has already been estimated. The estimations strategy of starting from the most accurate node (smallest gap node) reduces the problem of estimation error propagation. The results in the evaluation section indicate that applying distribution-based estimation could give statistically better results. 5.4 Adaptive MSP So far, all the enhancements to basic MSP focus on improving the multi-sequence processing algorithm given a fixed set of scan directions. All these enhancements require only more computing time without any overhead to the sensor nodes. Obviously, it is possible to have some choice and optimization on how events are generated. For example, in military situations, artillery or rocket-launched mini-ultrasound bombs can be used for event generation at some selected locations. In adaptive MSP, we carefully generate each new localization event so as to maximize the contribution of the new event to the refinement of localization, based on feedback from previous events. Figure 9 depicts the basic architecture of adaptive MSP. Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas. The idea of adaptive MSP is to generate the next localization event to achieve best-effort elimination, which ideally could shrink the location area of individual node as much as possible. We use a weighted voting mechanism to evaluate candidate localization events. Every node wants the next event to split its area evenly, which would shrink the area fast. Therefore, every node votes for the parameters of the next event (e.g., the scan angle k of the straight-line scan). Since the area map is maintained centrally, the vote is virtually done and there is no need for the real sensor nodes to participate in it. After gathering all the voting results, the event parameters with the most votes win the election. There are two factors that determine the weight of each vote: • The vote for each candidate event is weighted according to the diameter D of the nodes location area. Nodes with bigger location areas speak louder in the voting, because Map Partitioned by the Localization Events Diameter of Each Area Candidate Localization Events Evaluation Trigger Next Localization Evet Figure 9.

Candidate Slops for Node 3 at Anchor 1 overall system error is reduced mostly by splitting the larger areas. • The vote for each candidate event is also weighted according to its elimination efficiency for a location area, which is defined as how equally in size (or in diameter) an event can cut an area. In other words, an optimal scan event cuts an area in the middle, since this cut shrinks the area quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly. Combining the above two aspects, the weight for each vote is computed according to the following equation (1): Weight(k j i ) = f(Di,△(k j i ,k opt i )) (1) k j i is node is jth supporting parameter for next event generation; Di is diameter of node is location area; △(k j i ,k opt i ) is the distance between k j i and the optimal parameter k opt i for node i, which should be defined to fit the specific application. Figure 10 presents an example for node 1s voting for the slopes of the next straight-line scan. In the system, there are a fixed number of candidate slopes for each scan (e.g., k1,k2,k3,k4...). The location area of target node 3 is shown in the figure. The candidate events k1 3,k2 3,k3 3,k4 3,k5 3,k6 3 are evaluated according to their effectiveness compared to the optimal ideal event which is shown as a dotted line with appropriate weights computed according to equation (1). For this specific example, as is illustrated in the right part of Figure 10, f(Di,△(k j i ,kopt i )) is defined as the following equation (2): Weight(kj i ) = f(Di,△(kj i ,kopt i )) = Di · Ssmall Slarge (2) Ssmall and Slarge are the sizes of the smaller part and larger part of the area cut by the candidate line respectively. In this case, node 3 votes 0 for the candidate lines that do not cross its area since Ssmall = 0. We show later that adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy in WSNs with irregularly shaped deployment areas. 20 5.5 Overhead and MSP Complexity Analysis This section provides a complexity analysis of the MSP design. We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events. They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections. In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful. According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size. According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S). Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP. The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater. The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit. In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node. For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n). A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3). However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization. In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan. However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained. Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system. This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation. For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface. Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable. If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11. Example of Wave Propagation Situation • Under the situation of line-of-sight, we allow obstacles to reflect or deflect the wave. Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event. Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves. The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency. This reduces the chances of false detection. The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event. The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence. Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11. In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources. The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors. Each node is located in one of the small areas. Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario. However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation. Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations. Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence. In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area. Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization. In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events. In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete. This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors. In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing. First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP. Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization. Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps. For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors. Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes. Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol. For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes. A solid line between two nodes stands for a communication link. Suppose a straight line scans from left to right. Node 1 detects the event, and then it broadcasts the sequence (1) into the network. Node 2 and node 3 receive this sequence. When node 2 detects the event, node 2 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts (1, 2). The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a). Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6). In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high. For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other. While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop. One problem that may occur using the listen-detectassemble-report protocol is multiple partial sequences as shown in Figure 12 (b). Two separate paths in the network may result in two sequences that could not be further combined. In this case, since the two sequences can only be processed as separate sequences, some order information is lost. Therefore the 1,2,5,4 1,3,7,4 1,2,3,5 1,2,3,5,7,4 1,2,3,5,7 1,2,3,5 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,2,3,5,7,4,6 1,2,5 1,3,7 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3,7,4,6 1,2,5,4,6 (a) (b) (c) 1,3,2,5 1,3,2,5,7,4 1,3,2,5,7 1,3,2,5 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,3,2,5,7,4,6 Event Propagation Event Propagation Event Propagation Figure 12. Node Sequence without Time Synchronization accuracy of the system would decrease. The other problem is the sequence flip problem. As shown in Figure 12 (c), because node 2 and node 3 are too close to each other along the scan direction, they detect the scan almost simultaneously. Due to the uncertainty such as media access delay, two messages could be transmitted out of order. For example, if node 3 sends out its report first, then the order of node 2 and node 3 gets flipped in the final node sequence. The sequence flip problem would appear even in an accurately synchronized system due to random jitter in node detection if an event arrives at multiple nodes almost simultaneously. A method addressing the sequence flip is presented in the next section. 7.3 Sequence Flip and Protection Band Sequence flip problems can be solved with and without time synchronization. We firstly start with a scenario applying time synchronization. Existing solutions for time synchronization [12, 6] can easily achieve sub-millisecond-level accuracy. For example, FTSP [12] achieves 16.9µs (microsecond) average error for a two-node single-hop case. Therefore, we can comfortably assume that the network is synchronized with maximum error of 1000µs. However, when multiple nodes are located very near to each other along the event propagation direction, even when time synchronization with less than 1ms error is achieved in the network, sequence flip may still occur. For example, in the sound wave propagation case, if two nodes are less than 0.34 meters apart, the difference between their detection timestamp would be smaller than 1 millisecond. We find that sequence flip could not only damage system accuracy, but also might cause a fatal error in the MSP algorithm. Figure 13 illustrates both detrimental results. In the left side of Figure 13(a), suppose node 1 and node 2 are so close to each other that it takes less than 0.5ms for the localization event to propagate from node 1 to node 2. Now unfortunately, the node sequence is mistaken to be (2,1). So node 1 is expected to be located to the right of node 2, such as at the position of the dashed node 1. According to the elimination rule in sequencebased MSP, the left part of node 1s area is cut off as shown in the right part of Figure 13(a). This is a potentially fatal error, because node 1 is actually located in the dashed area which has been eliminated by mistake. During the subsequent eliminations introduced by other events, node 1s area might be cut off completely, thus node 1 could consequently be erased from the map! Even in cases where node 1 still survives, its area actually does not cover its real location. 22 1 2 12 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Flipped Sequence Fatal Elimination Error EventPropagation 1 1 Fatal Error 1 1 2 12 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Flipped Sequence Safe Elimination EventPropagation 1 1 New lower boundary of 1 1 B (a) (b) B: Protection band Figure 13. Sequence Flip and Protection Band Another problem is not fatal but lowers the localization accuracy. If we get the right node sequence (1,2), node 1 has a new upper boundary which can narrow the area of node 1 as in Figure 3. Due to the sequence flip, node 1 loses this new upper boundary. In order to address the sequence flip problem, especially to prevent nodes from being erased from the map, we propose a protection band compensation approach. The basic idea of protection band is to extend the boundary of the location area a little bit so as to make sure that the node will never be erased from the map. This solution is based on the fact that nodes have a high probability of flipping in the sequence if they are near to each other along the event propagation direction. If two nodes are apart from each other more than some distance, say, B, they rarely flip unless the nodes are faulty. The width of a protection band B, is largely determined by the maximum error in system time synchronization and the localization event propagation speed. Figure 13(b) presents the application of the protection band. Instead of eliminating the dashed part in Figure 13(a) for node 1, the new lower boundary of node 1 is set by shifting the original lower boundary of node 2 to the left by distance B. In this case, the location area still covers node 1 and protects it from being erased. In a practical implementation, supposing that the ultrasound event is used, if the maximum error of system time synchronization is 1ms, two nodes might flip with high probability if the timestamp difference between the two nodes is smaller than or equal to 1ms. Accordingly, we set the protection band B as 0.34m (the distance sound can propagate within 1 millisecond). By adding the protection band, we reduce the chances of fatal errors, although at the cost of localization accuracy. Empirical results obtained from our physical test-bed verified this conclusion. In the case of using the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, the only change we need to make is to select the protection band according to the maximum delay uncertainty introduced by the MAC operation and the event propagation speed. To bound MAC delay at the node side, a node can drop its report message if it experiences excessive MAC delay. This converts the sequence flip problem to the incomplete sequence problem, which can be more easily addressed by the method proposed in Section 7.1. 8 Simulation Evaluation Our evaluation of MSP was conducted on three platforms: (i) an indoor system with 46 MICAz motes using straight-line scan, (ii) an outdoor system with 20 MICAz motes using sound wave propagation, and (iii) an extensive simulation under various kinds of physical settings. In order to understand the behavior of MSP under numerous settings, we start our evaluation with simulations. Then, we implemented basic MSP and all the advanced MSP methods for the case where time synchronization is available in the network. The simulation and implementation details are omitted in this paper due to space constraints, but related documents [25] are provided online at http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/MSP. Full implementation and evaluation of system without time synchronization are yet to be completed in the near future. In simulation, we assume all the node sequences are perfect so as to reveal the performance of MSP achievable in the absence of incomplete node sequences or sequence flips. In our simulations, all the anchor nodes and target nodes are assumed to be deployed uniformly. The mean and maximum errors are averaged over 50 runs to obtain high confidence. For legibility reasons, we do not plot the confidence intervals in this paper. All the simulations are based on the straight-line scan example. We implement three scan strategies: • Random Scan: The slope of the scan line is randomly chosen at each time. • Regular Scan: The slope is predetermined to rotate uniformly from 0 degree to 180 degrees. For example, if the system scans 6 times, then the scan angles would be: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150. • Adaptive Scan: The slope of each scan is determined based on the localization results from previous scans. We start with basic MSP and then demonstrate the performance improvements one step at a time by adding (i) sequencebased MSP, (ii) iterative MSP, (iii) DBE MSP and (iv) adaptive MSP. 8.1 Performance of Basic MSP The evaluation starts with basic MSP, where we compare the performance of random scan and regular scan under different configurations. We intend to illustrate the impact of the number of anchors M, the number of scans d, and target node density (number of target nodes N in a fixed-size region) on the localization error. Table 1 shows the default simulation parameters. The error of each node is defined as the distance between the estimated location and the real position. We note that by default we only use three anchors, which is considerably fewer than existing range-free solutions [8, 4]. Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan under a different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. The number of anchors Table 1.

Improvements of Sequence-Based MSP over Basic MSP is 3 by default. Figure 14(a) indicates the following: (i) as the number of scans increases, the localization error decreases significantly; for example, localization errors drop more than 60% from 3 scans to 30 scans; (ii) statistically, regular scan achieves better performance than random scan under identical number of scans. However, the performance gap reduces as the number of scans increases. This is expected since a large number of random numbers converges to a uniform distribution. Figure 14(a) also demonstrates that MSP requires only a small number of anchors to perform very well, compared to existing range-free solutions [8, 4]. Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan under different number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. The results shown in Figure 14(b) indicate that (i) as the number of anchor nodes increases, the localization error decreases, and (ii) statistically, regular scan obtains better results than random scan with identical number of anchors. By combining Figures 14(a) and 14(b), we can conclude that MSP allows a flexible tradeoff between physical cost (anchor nodes) and soft cost (localization events). Impact of the Target Node Density: In this experiment, we confirm that the density of target nodes has no impact on the accuracy, which motivated the design of sequence-based MSP. In this experiment, we compare regular scan with random scan under different number of target nodes from 10 to 190 in steps of 20. Results in Figure 14(c) show that mean localization errors remain constant across different node densities. However, when the number of target nodes increases, the average maximum error increases. Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that in basic MSP, regular scan are better than random scan under different numbers of anchors and scan events. This is because regular scans uniformly eliminate the map from different directions, while random scans would obtain sequences with redundant overlapping information, if two scans choose two similar scanning slopes. 8.2 Improvements of Sequence-Based MSP This section evaluates the benefits of exploiting the order information among target nodes by comparing sequence-based MSP with basic MSP. In this and the following sections, regular scan is used for straight-line scan event generation. The purpose of using regular scan is to keep the scan events and the node sequences identical for both sequence-based MSP and basic MSP, so that the only difference between them is the sequence processing procedure. Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we compare sequence-based MSP with basic MSP under different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. Figure 15(a) indicates significant performance improvement in sequence-based MSP over basic MSP across all scan settings, especially when the number of scans is large. For example, when the number of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20% of that of basic MSP. We conclude that sequence-based MSP performs extremely well when there are many scan events. Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we use different number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3. As seen in Figure 15(b), the mean error and maximum error of sequence-based MSP is much smaller than that of basic MSP. Especially when there is limited number of anchors in the system, e.g., 3 anchors, the error rate was almost halved by using sequence-based MSP. This phenomenon has an interesting explanation: the cutting lines created by anchor nodes are exploited by both basic MSP and sequence-based MSP, so as the 24 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Basic MSP VS Iterative MSP Iterative Times Error Max Error of Iterative Seq MSP Mean Error of Iterative Seq MSP Max Error of Basic MSP Mean Error of Basic MSP Figure 16.

The Improvements of Adaptive MSP number of anchor nodes increases, anchors tend to dominate the contribution. Therefore the performance gaps lessens. Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 15(c) demonstrates the benefits of exploiting order information among target nodes. Since sequence-based MSP makes use of the information among the target nodes, having more target nodes contributes to the overall system accuracy. As the number of target nodes increases, the mean error and maximum error of sequence-based MSP decreases. Clearly the mean error in basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown in Figure 15(c). Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that exploiting order information among target nodes can improve accuracy significantly, especially when the number of events is large but with few anchors. 8.3 Iterative MSP over Sequence-Based MSP In this experiment, the same node sequences were processed iteratively multiple times. In Figure 16, the two single marks are results from basic MSP, since basic MSP doesnt perform iterations. The two curves present the performance of iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP. Therefore, Figure 16 compares the three methods to one another. Figure 16 shows that the second iteration can reduce the mean error and maximum error dramatically. After that, the performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5. This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first iteration. Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations. 8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance. Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution localization errors. In general, the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left of that of non-DBE MSP, which indicates that DBE MSP has a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error than non-DBE MSP. We note that because DBE is augmented on top of the best solution so far, the performance improvement is not significant. When we apply DBE on basic MSP methods, the improvement is much more significant. We omit these results because of space constraints. 8.5 Improvements of Adaptive MSP This section illustrates the performance of adaptive MSP over non-adaptive MSP. We note that feedback-based adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only the scanning angles but not the sequence processing. In this experiment, we evaluated how adaptive MSP can improve the best solution so far. The default angle granularity (step) for adaptive searching is 5 degrees. Impact of Area Shape: First, if system settings are regular, the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results. For a square area (regular), the performance of adaptive MSP and regular scans are very close. However, if the shape of the area is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate localization events to compensate. Therefore, adaptive MSP can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown in Figure 18(a). For example, adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10. Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 18(a) shows that when the node density is low, adaptive MSP brings more benefit than when node density is high. This phenomenon makes statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when the number of nodes is increased. Adaptive MSP has an edge 25 Figure 19. The Mirage Test-bed (Line Scan) Figure 20. The 20-node Outdoor Experiments (Wave) when layout is not uniform. Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the statistical performance in terms of mean error. The rationale is clear, as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle. 8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve localization performance. In other words, these optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly improve the overall performance. We note that our simulations were done under assumption that the complete node sequence can be obtained without sequence flips. In the next section, we present two real-system implementations that reveal and address these practical issues. 9 System Evaluation In this section, we present a system implementation of MSP on two physical test-beds. The first one is called Mirage, a large indoor test-bed composed of six 4-foot by 8-foot boards, illustrated in Figure 19. Each board in the system can be used as an individual sub-system, which is powered, controlled and metered separately. Three Hitachi CP-X1250 projectors, connected through a Matorx Triplehead2go graphics expansion box, are used to create an ultra-wide integrated display on six boards. Figure 19 shows that a long tilted line is generated by the projectors. We have implemented all five versions of MSP on the Mirage test-bed, running 46 MICAz motes. Unless mentioned otherwise, the default setting is 3 anchors and 6 scans at the scanning line speed of 8.6 feet/s. In all of our graphs, each data point represents the average value of 50 trials. In the outdoor system, a Dell A525 speaker is used to generate 4.7KHz sound as shown in Figure 20. We place 20 MICAz motes in the backyard of a house. Since the location is not completely open, sound waves are reflected, scattered and absorbed by various objects in the vicinity, causing a multi-path effect. In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation. First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses. Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization. We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system. In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips. Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds. The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans. This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors. Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes. When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)). With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping. Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty. Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods. Figure 23(a) shows that a protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s. Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show clearly that iterative MSP (with adaptation) achieves best performance. For example, Figures 23(b) shows that when we set the protection band at 0.05 feet, iterative MSP achieves 0.7 feet accuracy, which is 42% more accurate than the basic design. Similarly, Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show the double-edged effects of protection band on the localization accuracy. 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (3) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 14.6feet/s Flips Node Distance in the Ideal Node Sequence 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (2) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 8.6feet/s Flips 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (1) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 4.3feet/s Flips Figure 21.

Impact of the Number of Anchors and Scans 9.1.3 On Number of Anchors and Scans In this experiment, we show a tradeoff between hardware cost (anchors) with soft cost (events). Figure 24(a) shows that with more cutting lines created by anchors, the chance of unlocalized nodes increases slightly. We note that with a 0.35 feet protection band, the percentage of unlocalized nodes is very small, e.g., in the worst-case with 11 anchors, only 2 out of 46 nodes are not localized due to flipping. Figures 24(b) and 24(c) show the tradeoff between number of anchors and the number of scans. Obviously, with the number of anchors increases, the error drops significantly. With 11 anchors we can achieve a localization accuracy as low as 0.25 ∼ 0.35 feet, which is nearly a 60% improvement. Similarly, with increasing number of scans, the accuracy drops significantly as well. We can observe about 30% across all anchor settings when we increase the number of scans from 4 to 8. For example, with only 3 anchors, we can achieve 0.6-foot accuracy with 8 scans. 9.2 Outdoor System Evaluation The outdoor system evaluation contains two parts: (i) effective detection distance evaluation, which shows that the node sequence can be readily obtained, and (ii) sound propagation based localization, which shows the results of wavepropagation-based localization. 9.2.1 Effective Detection Distance Evaluation We firstly evaluate the sequence flip phenomenon in wave propagation. As shown in Figure 25, 20 motes were placed as five groups in front of the speaker, four nodes in each group at roughly the same distances to the speaker. The gap between each group is set to be 2, 3, 4 and 5 feet respectively in four experiments. Figure 26 shows the results. The x-axis in each subgraph indicates the group index. There are four nodes in each group (4 bars). The y-axis shows the detection rank (order) of each node in the node sequence. As distance between each group increases, number of flips in the resulting node sequence 27 Figure 25.

Localization Error (Sound) decreases. For example, in the 2-foot distance subgraph, there are quite a few flips between nodes in adjacent and even nonadjacent groups, while in the 5-foot subgraph, flips between different groups disappeared in the test. 9.2.2 Sound Propagation Based Localization As shown in Figure 20, 20 motes are placed as a grid including 5 rows with 5 feet between each row and 4 columns with 4 feet between each column. Six 4KHz acoustic wave propagation events are generated around the mote grid by a speaker. Figure 27 shows the localization results using iterative MSP (3 times iterative processing) with a protection band of 3 feet. The average error of the localization results is 3 feet and the maximum error is 5 feet with one un-localized node. We found that sequence flip in wave propagation is more severe than that in the indoor, line-based test. This is expected due to the high propagation speed of sound. Currently we use MICAz mote, which is equipped with a low quality microphone. We believe that using a better speaker and more events, the system can yield better accuracy. Despite the hardware constrains, the MSP algorithm still successfully localized most of the nodes with good accuracy. 10 Conclusions In this paper, we present the first work that exploits the concept of node sequence processing to localize sensor nodes. We demonstrated that we could significantly improve localization accuracy by making full use of the information embedded in multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences. We proposed four novel optimization methods, exploiting order and marginal distribution among non-anchor nodes as well as the feedback information from early localization results. Importantly, these optimization methods can be used together, and improve accuracy additively. The practical issues of partial node sequence and sequence flip were identified and addressed in two physical system test-beds. We also evaluated performance at scale through analysis as well as extensive simulations. Results demonstrate that requiring neither costly hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution, MSP can achieve a sub-foot accuracy with very few anchor nodes provided sufficient events. 11 References [1] CC2420 Data Sheet.

La mayoría de estos necesitan identificar las ubicaciones de los nodos de sensores inalámbricos, una tarea desafiante debido a las severas limitaciones sobre el costo, la energía y la gama efectiva de dispositivos de sensores. Para superar las limitaciones en las soluciones existentes, presentamos un método de posicionamiento de secuencia múltiple (MSP) para la localización del nodo del sensor estacionario a gran escala en entornos al aire libre. La nueva idea detrás de MSP es reconstruir y estimar la información de ubicación bidimensional para cada nodo del sensor procesando múltiples secuencias de nodos unidimensionales, fácilmente obtenidas a través de una distribución de eventos ligeramente guiada. A partir de un diseño básico de MSP, proponemos cuatro optimizaciones, que trabajan juntas para aumentar la precisión de localización. Abordamos varios temas interesantes, como secuencias de nodo incompletas (parciales) y flip de secuencia, que se encuentran en el lecho de prueba de Mirage que construimos. Hemos evaluado el sistema MSP a través del análisis teórico, una simulación extensa, así como dos sistemas físicos (una versión interior con 46 Micaz Motes y una versión al aire libre con 20 Micaz Motes). Esta evaluación demuestra que MSP puede lograr una precisión dentro de un pie, que no requiere hardware costoso adicional en nodos sensores ni distribución de eventos precisos. También proporciona una buena compensación entre el costo físico (anclajes) y el costo suave (eventos), al tiempo que mantiene la precisión de la localización. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos C.2.4 [Redes de comunicaciones informáticas]: los sistemas distribuidos Términos generales Algoritmos, medición, diseño, rendimiento, experimentación 1 Introducción Aunque las redes de sensores inalámbricos (WSN) han mostrado perspectivas prometedoras en diversas aplicaciones [5], los investigadores aún enfrentan variosDesafíos para la implementación masiva de tales redes. Una de ellas es identificar la ubicación de los nodos de sensores individuales en entornos al aire libre. Debido a la dinámica de flujo impredecible en escenarios en el aire, actualmente no es factible localizar nodos de sensores durante la implementación masiva basada en UVA. Por otro lado, la información geométrica es indispensable en estas redes, ya que los usuarios deben saber dónde ocurren los eventos de interés (por ejemplo, la ubicación de los intrusos o de una explosión de bombas). La investigación previa sobre la localización de nodos se divide en dos categorías: enfoques basados en rango y enfoques sin rango. Los enfoques basados en el rango [13, 17, 19, 24] calculan la información de ubicación por nodo de iteración o recursiva basada en distancias medidas entre los nodos objetivo y algunos anclajes que conocen precisamente sus ubicaciones. Estos enfoques generalmente requieren hardware costoso (por ejemplo, GPS) y tienen un rango efectivo limitado debido a limitaciones de energía (por ejemplo, TDOA basado en ultrasonido [3, 17]). Aunque las soluciones a base de alcance se pueden usar adecuadamente en entornos interiores a pequeña escala, se consideran menos rentables para las implementaciones a gran escala. Por otro lado, los enfoques sin rango [4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15] no requieren mediciones de distancia precisas, pero localizan el nodo en función de la información de conectividad de red (proximidad). Desafortunadamente, dado que la conectividad inalámbrica está altamente influenciada por el entorno y la calibración de hardware, las soluciones existentes no logran ofrecer resultados empíricos alentadores o requieren una encuesta sustancial [2] y la calibración [24] caso por caso. Al darse cuenta de la impracticabilidad de las soluciones existentes para el entorno al aire libre a gran escala, los investigadores han propuesto recientemente soluciones (por ejemplo, Spotlight [20] y Lighthouse [18]) para la localización del nodo del sensor utilizando la correlación espacio-temporal de eventos controlados (es decir, inferir los nodos basados en lugares basados en ubicaciones basadas en los nodosen el tiempo de detección de eventos controlados). Estas soluciones demuestran que la localización de largo alcance y de alta precisión se puede lograr simultáneamente con poco costo adicional en los nodos sensores. Sin embargo, estos beneficios vienen junto con una suposición implícita de que los eventos controlados pueden distribuirse con precisión a una ubicación especificada en un tiempo especificado. Argumentamos que la distribución precisa de eventos es difícil de lograr, especialmente a gran escala cuando el terreno es desigual, el dispositivo de distribución de eventos no está bien calibrado y su posición es difícil de mantener (por ejemplo, el escenario montado en el helicóptero en [20]). Para abordar estas limitaciones en los enfoques actuales, en este documento presentamos un método 15 de posicionamiento de secuencia múltiple (MSP) 15 para la localización del nodo del sensor estacionario a gran escala, en implementaciones donde una fuente de eventos tiene línea de visión para todos los sensores. La nueva idea detrás de MSP es estimar cada ubicación bidimensional de cada sensor procesando múltiples secuencias de nodos unidimensionales fáciles de obtener (por ejemplo, orden de detección de eventos) obtenidas a través de la distribución de eventos con holgada. Este diseño ofrece varios beneficios. Primero, en comparación con un enfoque basado en rango, MSP no requiere hardware costoso adicional. Funciona utilizando sensores típicamente utilizados por aplicaciones de red de sensores, como sensores de luz y acústica, los cuales consideramos específicamente en este trabajo. En segundo lugar, en comparación con un enfoque sin rango, MSP solo necesita un pequeño número de anclajes (teóricamente, tan solo dos), por lo que se puede lograr económicamente una alta precisión al introducir más eventos en lugar de más anclajes. Y tercero, en comparación con el centro de atención, MSP no requiere una distribución de eventos precisa y sofisticada, una ventaja que simplifica significativamente el diseño del sistema y reduce el costo de calibración. Este documento ofrece las siguientes contribuciones intelectuales adicionales: • Somos los primeros en localizar nodos de sensores utilizando el concepto de secuencia de nodos, una lista ordenada de nodos de sensores, ordenados por el tiempo de detección de un evento diseminado. Demostramos que hacer un uso completo de la información integrada en secuencias de nodos unidimensionales puede mejorar significativamente la precisión de localización. Curiosamente, descubrimos que el reprocesamiento repetido de secuencias de nodos unidimensionales puede aumentar aún más la precisión de localización.• Proponemos una estrategia de estimación de ubicación basada en la distribución que obtiene la ubicación final de los nodos sensores utilizando la probabilidad marginal de distribución articular entre nodos adyacentes dentro de la secuencia. Este nuevo algoritmo supera a la estimación centralide ampliamente adoptada [4, 8].• Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer trabajo para mejorar la precisión de localización de los nodos por eventos adaptativos. La generación de eventos posteriores se guía por los resultados de localización de eventos anteriores.• Evaluamos el MSP basado en línea en nuestro nuevo Mirage Test-Bed y MSP basado en olas en entornos al aire libre. A través de la implementación del sistema, descubrimos y abordamos varios temas interesantes, como secuencia parcial y flips de secuencia. Para revelar el rendimiento de MSP a escala, proporcionamos resultados analíticos, así como un estudio de simulación completo. Todo el código de simulación e implementación está disponible en línea en http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/msp. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 examina brevemente el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 3 presenta una descripción general del sistema de localización MSP. En las secciones 4 y 5, se introducen MSP básicos y cuatro métodos de procesamiento avanzado. La Sección 6 describe cómo se puede aplicar MSP en un escenario de propagación de onda. La Sección 7 discute varios problemas de implementación. La Sección 8 presenta resultados de simulación, y la Sección 9 informa una evaluación de MSP en el lecho de prueba Mirage y un lecho de prueba al aire libre. La Sección 10 concluye el documento.2 Trabajo relacionado Se han propuesto muchos métodos para localizar dispositivos de sensores inalámbricos al aire libre. La mayoría de estos se pueden clasificar en dos categorías: localización basada en rango y sin rango. Los sistemas de localización basados en el rango, como GPS [23], Cricket [17], Ahlos [19], AOA [16], Cuadriláteros robustos [13] y barridos [7], se basan en la estimación de distancia de punto de grano finoo estimación de ángulo para identificar la ubicación de Pernode. Las restricciones sobre la huella de costo, energía y hardware de cada nodo sensor hacen que estos métodos basados en el rango no sean deseables para la implementación masiva al aire libre. Además, las señales de alcance generadas por los nodos sensores tienen un rango efectivo muy limitado debido a las preocupaciones de factor de energía y forma. Por ejemplo, las señales de ultrasonido generalmente propagan efectivamente 20-30 pies usando un transmisor integrado [17]. En consecuencia, estas soluciones basadas en el rango requieren una densidad de despliegue indeseablemente alta. Aunque los métodos relacionados con el indicador de resistencia a la señal recibido (RSSI) [2, 24] alguna vez se consideraron una solución ideal de bajo costo, la irregularidad de la propagación de radio [26] limita seriamente la precisión de dichos sistemas. El sistema de localización de RIPS recientemente propuesto [11] superpone dos ondas de RF juntas, creando una envoltura de baja frecuencia que se puede medir con precisión. Esta técnica de alcance funciona muy bien siempre que las antenas estén bien orientadas y los factores ambientales, como los efectos de múltiples rutas y el ruido de fondo, se abordan suficientemente. Los métodos sin rango no necesitan estimar o medir distancias o ángulos precisos. En cambio, se utilizan anclajes o distribuciones de eventos controlados para la localización de nodos. Los métodos sin rango se pueden clasificar generalmente en dos tipos: soluciones basadas en ancla y sin anclaje.• Para soluciones basadas en ancla como Centroide [4], APIT [8], Serloc [10], Gradiente [13] y APS [15], la idea principal es que la ubicación de cada nodo se estima en función del conocidoUbicaciones de los nodos de anclaje. Diferentes combinaciones de anclaje reducen las áreas en las que se pueden ubicar los nodos objetivo. Las soluciones basadas en ancla normalmente requieren una alta densidad de nodos de anclaje para lograr una buena precisión. En la práctica, es deseable tener la menor cantidad de nodos de anclaje posible para reducir el costo del sistema.• Las soluciones sin anclaje no requieren nodos de anclaje. En su lugar, se utilizan generadores de eventos externos y plataformas de procesamiento de datos. La idea principal es correlacionar el tiempo de detección de eventos en un nodo del sensor con la relación espacio-tiempo conocida de los eventos controlados en el generador para que los tampones de tiempo de detección se puedan asignar en las ubicaciones de los sensores. Spotlight [20] y el faro [18] funcionan de esta manera. En Spotlight [20], la distribución del evento debe ser precisa tanto en el tiempo como en el espacio. La distribución precisa de eventos es difícil de lograr sin una calibración cuidadosa, especialmente cuando los dispositivos de generación de eventos requieren ciertas maniobras mecánicas (por ejemplo, el soporte del telescopio utilizado en el centro de atención). Todos estos aumentan el costo del sistema y reducen la velocidad de localización. Stardust [21], que funciona mucho más rápido, utiliza algoritmos de relajación de etiquetas para que coincidan con los puntos de luz reflejados por los reflectores retro de cubo de esquina (CCR) con nodos de sensores utilizando varias restricciones. Los algoritmos de relajación de etiquetas convergen solo cuando se obtienen un número suficiente de restricciones robustas. Sin embargo, debido al impacto ambiental en las limitaciones de conectividad de RF, Stardust es menos preciso que el centro de atención. En este artículo, proponemos una solución equilibrada que evite las limitaciones de las soluciones basadas en ancla y sin anclaje. A diferencia de las soluciones basadas en el ancla [4, 8], MSP permite una compensación flexible entre el costo físico (nodos de anclaje) con el Soft 16 1 A B 2 3 4 5 Nodo nodoanchor objetivo 1A 5 3 B2 4 1 B2 5A 43 1A25B4 3 1 52AB 4 3 1 2 3 5 4 (b) (c) (d) (a) Evento 1 Secuencia de nodo Generada por Evento 1 Evento 3 Secuencia de nodo generada por la secuencia del nodo del evento generada por la secuencia del nodo del evento 3 generada por el evento 4 Evento 2Evento 4 Figura 1. El costo de descripción general del sistema MSP (eventos de localización). MSP usa solo un pequeño número de anclajes (teóricamente, tan pocos como dos). A diferencia de las soluciones sin anclaje, MSP no necesita mantener relaciones rígidas de espacio de tiempo mientras se distribuye eventos, lo que hace que el diseño del sistema sea más simple, más flexible y más robusto para los errores de calibración.3 Descripción general del sistema MSP funciona extrayendo información de ubicación relativa de múltiples ordenamientos simples de nodos unidimensionales. La Figura 1 (a) muestra un diseño de una red de sensores con nodos de anclaje y nodos de destino. Los nodos objetivo se definen como los nodos para ser localizados. Brevemente, el sistema MSP funciona de la siguiente manera. Primero, los eventos se generan uno a la vez en el área de la red (por ejemplo, propagaciones de ultrasonido de diferentes ubicaciones, escaneos láser con diversos ángulos). A medida que se propaga cada evento, como se muestra en la Figura 1 (a), cada nodo lo detecta en un momento particular. Para un solo evento, llamamos el orden de los nodos, que se basa en la detección secuencial del evento, una secuencia de nodo. Cada secuencia de nodo incluye tanto los objetivos como los anclajes como se muestra en la Figura 1 (b). En segundo lugar, un algoritmo de procesamiento de secuencia múltiple ayuda a reducir la posible ubicación de cada nodo a un área pequeña (Figura 1 (c)). Finalmente, un método de estimación basado en distribución estima la ubicación exacta de cada nodo del sensor, como se muestra en la Figura 1 (d). La Figura 1 muestra que las secuencias de nodo se pueden obtener mucho más económicamente que las mediciones precisas de distancia en pareja entre nodos objetivo y nodos de anclaje a través de métodos de rango. Además, este sistema no requiere una relación rígida en el espacio de tiempo para los eventos de localización, lo cual es crítico pero difícil de lograr en escenarios de distribución de eventos controlados (por ejemplo, Spotlight [20]). En aras de la claridad en la presentación, presentamos nuestro sistema en dos casos: • Caso ideal, en el que todas las secuencias de nodo obtenidas de la red son completas y correctas, y los nodos están sincronizados en el tiempo [12, 9].• El despliegue realista, en el que (i) las secuencias de nodo pueden ser parciales (incompletos), (ii) los elementos en las secuencias podrían voltear (es decir, el orden obtenido se invierte de la realidad) y (iii) no los nodos no sincronizados en el tiempo. Para introducir el algoritmo MSP, primero consideramos un escenario de escaneo de línea recta simple. Luego, describimos cómo implementar escaneos en línea recta, así como otros tipos de eventos, como la propagación de onda de sonido.1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Escaneo de línea recta 1 Linaza recta2 8 1 5 A 6 C 4 3 7 2 B 9 3 1 C 5 9 2 A 4 6 B 7 8 Nodo de anclaje del nodo objetivo Figura 2. Obtención de múltiples secuencias de nodo 4 MSP básico consideremos una red de sensores con N nodos de destino y nodos de anclaje M desplegado aleatoriamente en un área de tamaño S. La idea de nivel superior para MSP básico es dividir todo el área de la red de sensores en piezas pequeñas porProcesamiento de secuencias de nodo. Debido a que se conocen las ubicaciones exactas de todos los anclajes en una secuencia de nodo, todos los nodos en esta secuencia se pueden dividir en partes O (M +1) en el área. En la Figura 2, usamos círculos numerados para denotar nodos objetivo y hexágonos numerados para denotar nodos de anclaje. Basic MSP utiliza dos líneas rectas para escanear el área desde diferentes direcciones, tratando cada escaneo como un evento. Todos los nodos reaccionan al evento que generan secuencialmente dos secuencias de nodos. Para la exploración vertical 1, la secuencia del nodo es (8,1,5, a, 6, c, 4,3,7,2, b, 9), como se muestra fuera del límite derecho del área en la Figura 2;Para la exploración horizontal 2, la secuencia del nodo es (3,1, c, 5,9,2, a, 4,6, b, 7,8), como se muestra debajo del límite inferior del área en la Figura 2. Dado que las ubicaciones de los nodos de anclaje están disponibles, los nodos de anclaje en las dos secuencias de nodo realmente dividen el área vertical y horizontalmente en 16 partes, como se muestra en la Figura 2. Para extender este proceso, supongamos que tenemos nodos de anclaje M y realizamos escaneos D desde diferentes ángulos, obteniendo secuencias de nodo D y dividiendo el área en muchas partes pequeñas. Obviamente, el número de piezas es una función del número de anclajes m, el número de escaneos D, la ubicación de los anclajes y la pendiente K para cada línea de escaneo. Según el teorema de corte de pastel [22], el área se puede dividir en partes O (m2d2). Cuando M y D son apropiadamente grandes, el polígono para cada nodo objetivo puede volverse lo suficientemente pequeño para que se pueda lograr una estimación precisa. Hacemos hincapié en que la precisión se ve afectada no solo por el número de anclajes m, sino también por el número de eventos d.En otras palabras, MSP proporciona una compensación entre el costo físico de los anclajes y el costo suave de los eventos. El algoritmo 1 muestra la arquitectura informática de MSP básico. Cada secuencia de nodo se procesa dentro de la línea 1 a 8. Para cada nodo, GetBoundars () en la línea 5 busca el predecesor y los anclajes sucesores en la secuencia para determinar los límites de este nodo. Luego, en la línea 6, UpdateMap () encoge el área de ubicación de este nodo de acuerdo con los límites recién obtenidos. Después de procesar todas las secuencias, la estimación centroide (línea 11) establece el centro de gravedad del polígono final como la ubicación estimada del nodo objetivo. MSP básico solo utiliza la información de pedido entre un nodo objetivo y los nodos de anclaje en cada secuencia. En realidad, podemos extraer mucha más información de ubicación del Algoritmo 1 Salida del proceso MSP básico: la ubicación estimada de cada nodo.1: Repita 2: getOneunProcessedseqence ();3: Repita 4: getOnenodeFromSequenceInorder ();5: getBoundaries ();6: UpdateMap ();7: hasta que se actualicen todos los nodos de destino;8: hasta que se procesen todas las secuencias de nodo;9: Repita 10: GetOneUnEdimatedNode ();11: CentroideStimation ();12: hasta que se estima todos los nodos objetivo;cada secuencia. La Sección 5 introducirá MSP avanzado, en el que se proponen cuatro optimizaciones novedosas para mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de MSP.5 Se proponen cuatro mejoras avanzadas para MSP básico en esta sección. Las primeras tres mejoras no necesitan una detección y comunicación adicionales en las redes, pero solo requieren un cálculo ligeramente más fuera de línea. El objetivo de todas estas mejoras es hacer uso completo de la información integrada en las secuencias de nodo. Los resultados que hemos obtenido indican empíricamente que la implementación de los dos primeros métodos puede reducir drásticamente el error de localización, y que los métodos tercero y cuarto son útiles para algunas implementaciones del sistema.5.1 MSP basado en secuencias Como se muestra en la Figura 2, cada línea de escaneo y anclajes M, divide todo el área en partes M + 1. Cada nodo objetivo cae en un polígono formado por líneas de escaneo. Notamos que en MSP básico, solo los anclajes se usan para reducir el polígono de cada nodo objetivo, pero en realidad hay más información en la secuencia del nodo que podemos usar. Primero veamos un ejemplo simple que se muestra en la Figura 3. Los escaneos anteriores reducen las ubicaciones del nodo objetivo 1 y el nodo 2 en dos rectángulos discontinuos que se muestran en la parte izquierda de la Figura 3. Luego, un nuevo escaneo genera una nueva secuencia (1, 2). Con el conocimiento de la dirección de escaneos, es fácil saber que el nodo 1 se encuentra a la izquierda del nodo 2. Por lo tanto, podemos reducir aún más el área de ubicación del nodo 2 eliminando la parte sombreada del rectángulo del nodo 2S. Esto se debe a que el nodo 2 se encuentra a la derecha del nodo 1, mientras que el área sombreada está fuera del límite inferior del nodo 1. Del mismo modo, el área de ubicación del nodo 1 se puede reducir eliminando la parte sombreada del límite derecho del nodo 2S. Llamamos a este MSP basado en la secuencia del procedimiento, lo que significa que toda la secuencia del nodo debe procesarse nodo por nodo en orden. Específicamente, el MSP basado en secuencias sigue esta regla de procesamiento exacta: 1 2 1 2 1 2 límite inferior de 1 límite superior de 1 límite inferior de 2 límites superior de 2 secuencia Nueva secuencia Nuevo límite superior de 1 nuevo límite inferior de 2 EventPropagation Figura 3. Ilustración de reglas en el algoritmo MSP basado en secuencia 2 Salida del proceso MSP basado en la secuencia: la ubicación estimada de cada nodo.1: Repita 2: getOneunProcessedseqence ();3: Repita 4: getOnenodebyIrcresingOrder ();5: CompuTelowBound ();6: UpdateMap ();7: Hasta el último nodo objetivo en la secuencia;8: Repita 9: getOnenodebyDecResingOrder ();10: ComputeUpBound ();11: UpdateMap ();12: Hasta el último nodo objetivo en la secuencia;13: hasta que se procesen todas las secuencias de nodo;14: Repita 15: GetOneUnEdimatedNode ();16: CentroideStimation ();17: hasta que se estima todos los nodos objetivo;Regla de eliminación: a lo largo de una dirección de escaneo, el límite inferior del área de los sucesores debe ser igual o mayor que el límite inferior del área de los predecesores, y el límite superior del área de los predecesores debe ser igual o menor que el límite superior delÁrea de sucesores. En el caso de la Figura 3, el nodo 2 es el sucesor del nodo 1, y el nodo 1 es el predecesor del nodo 2. De acuerdo con la regla de eliminación, el límite inferior del nodo 2S no puede ser más pequeño que el del límite superior del nodo 1 y el nodo 1 no puede exceder el límite superior del nodo 2S. El algoritmo 2 ilustra el código pseudo de MSP basado en secuencias. Cada secuencia de nodo se procesa dentro de la línea 3 a 13. El procesamiento de secuencia contiene dos pasos: Paso 1 (línea 3 a 7): Calcule y modifique el límite inferior para cada nodo objetivo aumentando el orden en la secuencia del nodo. Cada límite inferior de los nodos está determinado por el límite inferior de su nodo predecesor en la secuencia, por lo que el procesamiento debe comenzar desde el primer nodo en la secuencia y aumentando el orden. Luego actualice el mapa de acuerdo con el nuevo límite inferior. Paso 2 (línea 8 a 12): Calcule y modifique el límite superior para cada nodo disminuyendo el orden en la secuencia del nodo. Cada límite superior de los nodos está determinado por el límite superior de su nodo sucesor en la secuencia, por lo que el procesamiento debe comenzar desde el último nodo en la secuencia y mediante el orden decreciente. Luego actualice el mapa de acuerdo con el nuevo límite superior. Después de procesar todas las secuencias, para cada nodo, se ha encontrado un polígono que limita su posible ubicación. La estimación basada en el centro de gravedad se aplica para calcular la ubicación exacta de cada nodo (línea 14 a 17). Un ejemplo de este proceso se muestra en la Figura 4. El tercer escaneo genera la secuencia de nodo (B, 9,2,7,4,6,3,8, c, A, 5,1). Además de las líneas divididas de anclaje, debido a que los nodos 4 y 7 vienen después del nodo 2 en la secuencia, los polígonos del nodo 4 y 7S podrían reducirse de acuerdo con el límite inferior del nodo 2S (el área de sombra inferior derecha);Del mismo modo, el área sombreada en el rectángulo del nodo 2S podría eliminarse ya que esta parte está más allá del límite superior del nodo 7S indicado por la línea punteada. Se puede realizar una eliminación similar para el nodo 3 como se muestra en la figura.18 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Escaneo de línea recta 1 Línea recta 2 Escaneo de línea recta 3 Nodo de anclaje de nodo objetivo Figura 4.

MSP iterativo: Reprocesamiento de escaneo 1 desde arriba, podemos ver que el MSP basado en la secuencia utiliza la información incrustada en cada par de nodos secuencial en la secuencia del nodo. Los límites de polígono de los nodos objetivo obtenidos en Prior podrían usarse para dividir aún más otras áreas de nodos objetivo. Nuestra evaluación en las Secciones 8 y 9 muestra que MSP basado en secuencias mejora considerablemente la precisión del sistema.5.2 MSP iterativo basado en secuencia MSP es preferible a MSP básico porque extrae más información de la secuencia de nodo. De hecho, ¡aún queda más información útil! En MSP basado en secuencias, una secuencia procesada posteriormente se beneficia de la información producida por secuencias previamente procesadas (por ejemplo, el tercer escaneo en la Figura 5). Sin embargo, las primeras varias secuencias difícilmente pueden beneficiarse de otros escaneos de esta manera. Inspirados en este fenómeno, proponemos MSP iterativo. La idea básica de MSP iterativo es procesar todas las secuencias de iteración varias veces para que el procesamiento de cada secuencia única pueda beneficiarse de los resultados de otras secuencias. Para ilustrar la idea más claramente, la Figura 4 muestra los resultados de tres escaneos que han proporcionado tres secuencias. Ahora, si procesamos la secuencia (8,1,5, A, 6, C, 4,3,7,2, b, 9) obtenida de Scan 1 nuevamente, podemos progresar, como se muestra en la Figura 5. El reprocesamiento de la secuencia del nodo 1 proporciona información en la forma en que lo haría una exploración vertical adicional. A partir de MSP a base de secuencia, sabemos que los límites superiores de los nodos 3 y 4 a lo largo de la dirección del escaneo no deben extenderse más allá del límite superior del nodo 7, por lo tanto, las partes de la cuadrícula pueden eliminarse (a) Central de gravedad (b) Distribución de la junta 1 2 22 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 Figura 6. Ejemplo de estimación de distribución conjunta ... ... VM AP [0] VM AP [1] VM AP [2] VM AP [3] Combine M AP Figura 7. Idea de DBE MSP para cada nodo para los nodos 3 y el nodo 4, respectivamente, como se muestra en la Figura 5. A partir de este ejemplo, podemos ver que el procesamiento iterativo de la secuencia podría ayudar a reducir aún más el polígono de cada nodo objetivo y, por lo tanto, mejorar la precisión del sistema. La implementación de MSP iterativo es sencilla: procese todas las secuencias varias veces utilizando MSP basado en secuencias. Al igual que MSP basado en secuencias, Iterative MSP no presenta un costo adicional de eventos. En otras palabras, el reprocesamiento en realidad no repite el escaneo físicamente. Los resultados de la evaluación en la Sección 8 mostrarán que MSP iterativo contribuye notablemente a un error de localización más bajo. Los resultados empíricos muestran que después de 5 iteraciones, las mejoras se vuelven menos significativas. En resumen, el procesamiento iterativo puede lograr un mejor rendimiento con solo una pequeña sobrecarga de cálculo.5.3 Estimación basada en la distribución Después de determinar el polígono del área de ubicación para cada nodo, se necesita una estimación para una decisión final. Investigaciones anteriores aplicaron principalmente el método del centro de gravedad (COG) [4] [8] [10] que minimiza el error promedio. Si cada nodo es independiente de todos los demás, COG es la mejor solución estadísticamente. En MSP, sin embargo, cada nodo puede no ser independiente. Por ejemplo, dos nodos vecinos en una determinada secuencia podrían tener áreas de polígono superpuestas. En este caso, si la probabilidad marginal de distribución articular se usa para la estimación, se logran mejores resultados estadísticos. La Figura 6 muestra un ejemplo en el que el nodo 1 y el nodo 2 se encuentran en el mismo polígono. Si se usa COG, ambos nodos se localizan en la misma posición (Figura 6 (a)). Sin embargo, las secuencias de nodo obtenidas de dos escaneos indican que el nodo 1 debe estar a la izquierda y por encima del nodo 2, como se muestra en la Figura 6 (b). La idea de alto nivel de estimación basada en la distribución propuesta para MSP, que llamamos DBE MSP, se ilustra en la Figura 7. Las distribuciones de cada nodo debajo del escaneo ésimo (para la secuencia del nodo con ésimo) se estiman en Node.vmap [i], que es una estructura de datos para recordar la distribución marginal sobre el escaneo i. Luego, todos los VMAP se combinan para obtener un solo mapa y se usa una estimación ponderada para obtener la ubicación final. Para cada exploración, todos los nodos se clasifican de acuerdo con el espacio, que es el diámetro del polígono a lo largo de la dirección del escaneo, para producir una segunda secuencia de nodo basada en GAP. Luego, la estimación comienza desde el nodo con la brecha más pequeña. Esto se debe a que es estadísticamente más preciso asumir una distribución uniforme del nodo con una brecha más pequeña. Para cada nodo procesado en orden a partir de la secuencia de nodo basada en GAP, ya sea si 19 pred.El nodo predecesor del área de los nodos existe: distribución condicional basada en pred.Área de los nodos solo: sucucto uniformemente distribuido.Nodos Sucesor del área de los nodos existe: distribución condicional basada en Succ.Área de nodos succ.Área de nodos tanto predecesor y nodos sucesores: distribución condicional basada en ambos pred.Área de nodos Figura 8. Cuatro casos en el proceso DBE no hay nodo vecino en la secuencia original de nodo basada en eventos comparte un área superpuesta, o si los vecinos no se han procesado debido a brechas más grandes, se aplica un uniforme de distribución uniforme () a este nodo aislado (el caso soloen la Figura 8). Si se ha procesado la distribución de sus vecinos que comparten áreas superpuestas, calculamos la distribución conjunta para el nodo. Como se muestra en la Figura 8, hay tres casos posibles dependiendo de si la distribución del predecesor superpuesto y/o los nodos sucesores ya se han estimado/ya se ha estimado. La estrategia de estimaciones de comenzar desde el nodo más preciso (nodo de brecha más pequeño) reduce el problema de la propagación del error de estimación. Los resultados en la sección de evaluación indican que aplicar la estimación basada en la distribución podría dar resultados estadísticamente mejores.5.4 MSP adaptativo Hasta ahora, todas las mejoras para el MSP básico se centran en mejorar el algoritmo de procesamiento de secuencia múltiple dado un conjunto fijo de instrucciones de escaneo. Todas estas mejoras requieren solo más tiempo de computación sin ninguna sobrecarga a los nodos del sensor. Obviamente, es posible tener algunas opciones y optimización sobre cómo se generan los eventos. Por ejemplo, en situaciones militares, artillería o bombas de mini ultrasonido lanzadas por cohetes se pueden usar para la generación de eventos en algunos lugares seleccionados. En MSP adaptativo, generamos cuidadosamente cada nuevo evento de localización para maximizar la contribución del nuevo evento al refinamiento de la localización, en función de los comentarios de eventos anteriores. La Figura 9 muestra la arquitectura básica del MSP adaptativo. A través de eventos de localización anteriores, todo el mapa se ha dividido en muchas áreas de ubicación pequeñas. La idea del MSP adaptativo es generar el próximo evento de localización para lograr la eliminación del mejor esfuerzo, que idealmente podría reducir el área de ubicación del nodo individual tanto como sea posible. Utilizamos un mecanismo de votación ponderado para evaluar los eventos de localización de candidatos. Cada nodo quiere que el próximo evento divida su área de manera uniforme, lo que reduciría el área rápidamente. Por lo tanto, cada nodo vota para los parámetros del próximo evento (por ejemplo, el ángulo de escaneo K del escaneo de línea recta). Dado que el mapa del área se mantiene centralmente, el voto se realiza virtualmente y no hay necesidad de que los nodos sensores reales participen en él. Después de reunir todos los resultados de votación, los parámetros del evento con la mayor cantidad de votos ganan las elecciones. Hay dos factores que determinan el peso de cada voto: • El voto para cada evento candidato se ponderó de acuerdo con el diámetro D del área de ubicación de los nodos. Los nodos con áreas de ubicación más grandes hablan más fuerte en la votación, porque el mapa dividido por el diámetro de los eventos de localización de cada área Localización de los candidatos Eventos de evaluación de evaluación de la próxima localización Evet Figura 9. Arquitectura básica de MSP adaptativo 2 3 Diámetro D3 1 1 3K 2 3K 3 3K 4 3K 5 3K 6 3K 1 3K 2 3K 3 3K 6 3K4 3K 5 3K Peso El Small I Opt I J II J I S S DKKDFKWeight Arg), (()(⋅ = ∆ = 1 3 opt k nodo objetivo Nodo Nodo Centro del nodo de gravedad Área 3S Figura 10. Slops de candidato para el nodo 3 en el ancla 1 El error general del sistema se reduce principalmente al dividir las áreas más grandes.• La votación para cada evento candidato también se pondera de acuerdo con su eficiencia de eliminación para un área de ubicación, que se define como un tamaño igualmente de tamaño (o de diámetro) puede cortar un área. En otras palabras, un evento de escaneo óptimo corta un área en el medio, ya que este corte encoge el área rápidamente y, por lo tanto, reduce la incertidumbre de localización rápidamente. Combinando los dos aspectos anteriores, el peso para cada voto se calcula de acuerdo con la siguiente ecuación (1): peso (k j i) = f (di, △ (k j i, k opt i)) (1) k j j i es el nodo es el parámetro de soportepara la próxima generación de eventos;DI es el diámetro del nodo es el área de ubicación;△ (K J I, K opt I) es la distancia entre K J I y el parámetro óptimo K opt I para el nodo I, que debe definirse para adaptarse a la aplicación específica. La Figura 10 presenta un ejemplo para la votación del nodo 1 para las pendientes del siguiente escaneo de línea recta. En el sistema, hay un número fijo de pendientes candidatos para cada escaneo (por ejemplo, K1, K2, K3, K4 ...). El área de ubicación del nodo objetivo 3 se muestra en la figura. Los eventos candidatos K1 3, K2 3, K3 3, K4 3, K5 3, K6 3 se evalúan de acuerdo con su efectividad en comparación con el evento ideal óptimo que se muestra como una línea punteada con pesos apropiados calculados según la ecuación (1). Para este ejemplo específico, como se ilustra en la parte derecha de la Figura 10, F (Di, △ (K J I, Kopt I)) se define como la siguiente ecuación (2): peso (KJ I) = F (DI, △ ((KJ I, Kopt I)) = Di · Ssmall SLARGE (2) SSMALL y SLARGE son los tamaños de la parte más pequeña y la parte más grande del área cortada por la línea candidata respectivamente. En este caso, el nodo 3 vota 0 para las líneas candidatas que no cruzan su área desde ssmall = 0. Más tarde mostramos que MSP adaptativo mejora la precisión de localización en WSN con áreas de despliegue de forma irregular.20 5.5 Análisis de complejidad de sobrecarga y MSP Esta sección proporciona un análisis de complejidad del diseño MSP. Hacemos hincapié en que MSP adopta un diseño asimétrico en el que los nodos sensores solo necesitan detectar e informar los eventos. Son felizmente ajenos a los métodos de procesamiento propuestos en secciones anteriores. En esta sección, analizamos el costo computacional en el lado de procesamiento de la secuencia del nodo, donde los recursos son abundantes. Según el algoritmo 1, la complejidad computacional de MSP básica es O (d · n · s), y el espacio de almacenamiento requerido es o (n · s), donde d es el número de eventos, n es el número de nodos objetivo,y S es el tamaño del área. Según el Algoritmo 2, la complejidad computacional de MSP basada en secuencia y MSP iterativa es O (C · D · N · S), donde C es el número de iteraciones y C = 1 para MSP basado en secuencia, y el espacio de almacenamiento requerido es esO (n · s). Tanto la complejidad computacional como el espacio de almacenamiento son iguales dentro de un factor constante para los de MSP básico. La complejidad computacional de la estimación basada en la distribución (DBE MSP) es mayor. La sobrecarga principal proviene del cálculo de distribuciones conjuntas cuando salen los nodos predecesores y sucesores. Para calcular la probabilidad marginal, MSP necesita enumerar las ubicaciones del nodo predecesor y el nodo sucesor. Por ejemplo, si el nodo A tiene el nodo predecesor B y el nodo sucesor C, entonces la probabilidad marginal PA (x, y) del nodo como en la ubicación (x, y) es: pa (x, y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑m ∑ n 1 nb, a, c · pb (i, j) · pc (m, n) (3) nb, a, c es el número de ubicaciones válidas para una secuencia satisfactoria (b, a, c) cuandoB está en (i, j) y c está en (m, n);PB (I, J) es la probabilidad disponible de que el nodo BS se ubique en (I, J);La PC (M, N) es la probabilidad disponible de que el nodo CS se encuentre en (M, N). Un algoritmo ingenuo para calcular la ecuación (3) tiene complejidad O (D · N · S3). Sin embargo, dado que la probabilidad marginal de hecho proviene de solo una dimensión a lo largo de la dirección de escaneo (por ejemplo, una línea), la complejidad puede reducirse a O (D · N · S1.5) después de la optimización del algoritmo. Además, las áreas de ubicación final para cada nodo son mucho más pequeñas que el campo S original;Por lo tanto, en la práctica, DBE MSP se puede calcular mucho más rápido que O (D · N · S1.5).6 Ejemplo de propagación de ondas Hasta ahora, la descripción de MSP ha sido únicamente en el contexto del escaneo de línea recta. Sin embargo, observamos que MSP es conceptualmente independiente de cómo se propaga el evento siempre que se puedan obtener secuencias de nodo. Claramente, también podemos apoyar eventos basados en propagación de onda (por ejemplo, propagación de ultrasonido, propagación de explosión de aire), que son equivalencias de coordenadas polares de los escaneos de línea en el sistema de coordenadas cartesianas. Esta sección ilustra los efectos de la implementación de MSP en la situación basada en la propagación de onda. Para un modelado fácil, hemos hecho los siguientes supuestos: • La onda se propaga de manera uniforme en todas las direcciones, por lo tanto, la propagación tiene una superficie de fronteras circulares. Dado que MSP no depende de una relación espacio-tiempo precisa, una cierta distorsión en la propagación de onda es tolerable. Si se usa alguna onda direccional, la superficie fronteriza de propagación se puede modificar en consecuencia.1 3 5 9 NODO NODO TARGO NODO EVISO ANTIVO Ubicación A 2 Centro de gravedad 4 8 7 B 6 C Una línea de ubicaciones preferidas para el próximo evento Figura 11. Ejemplo de situación de propagación de ondas • Bajo la situación de la línea de visión, permitimos que los obstáculos reflejen o desvíen la onda. La reflexión y la deflexión no son problemas porque cada nodo reacciona solo al primer evento detectado. Las olas reflejadas o desviadas llegan más tarde que las ondas de la línea de visión. Lo único que el sistema necesita mantener es un intervalo de tiempo apropiado entre dos eventos de localización sucesivos.• Suponemos que el ruido de fondo existe y, por lo tanto, ejecutamos un filtro de paso de banda para escuchar una frecuencia de onda particular. Esto reduce las posibilidades de detección falsa. El parámetro que afecta la generación de eventos de localización aquí es la ubicación fuente del evento. Las diferentes distancias entre cada nodo y la fuente del evento determinan el rango de cada nodo en la secuencia del nodo. Usando las secuencias de nodo, el algoritmo MSP divide todo el área en muchas áreas no rectangulares como se muestra en la Figura 11. En esta figura, las estrellas representan dos fuentes de eventos anteriores. Las dos propagaciones anteriores dividen todo el mapa en muchas áreas por esos círculos discontinuos que pasan uno de los anclajes. Cada nodo se encuentra en una de las áreas pequeñas. Desde MSP basado en secuencias, MSP iterativo y DBE MSP no hacen suposiciones sobre el tipo de eventos de localización y la forma del área, los tres algoritmos de optimización se pueden aplicar para el escenario de propagación de onda. Sin embargo, el MSP adaptativo necesita más explicación. La Figura 11 ilustra un ejemplo de nodos que votan para las próximas ubicaciones de origen de eventos. A diferencia del escaneo de línea recta, el parámetro crítico ahora es la ubicación de la fuente del evento, porque la distancia entre cada nodo y la fuente del evento determina el rango del nodo en la secuencia. En la Figura 11, si el siguiente evento se rompe a lo largo/cerca de la línea gris gruesa y sólida, que perpendicularmente biseca la línea oscura sólida entre el ancla C y el centro de gravedad del área del nodo 9s (el área gris), la onda alcanzaría el ancla c de anclay el centro de gravedad del área del nodo 9S aproximadamente al mismo tiempo, lo que dividiría relativamente igualmente el área del nodo 9S. Por lo tanto, el nodo 9 prefiere votar por las posiciones alrededor de la gruesa línea gris.7 Problemas prácticos de implementación en aras de la presentación, hasta ahora hemos descrito MSP en un caso ideal donde se puede obtener una secuencia de nodo completa con una sincronización de tiempo precisa. En esta sección describimos cómo hacer que MSP funcione bien en condiciones más realistas.21 7.1 Secuencia de nodo incompleta por diversas razones, como el mal funcionamiento del sensor o los obstáculos naturales, los nodos en la red podrían no detectar eventos de localización. En tales casos, la secuencia del nodo no se completará. Este problema tiene dos versiones: • Faltan los nodos de anclaje en la secuencia del nodo si algunos nodos de anclaje no responden a los eventos de localización, entonces el sistema tiene menos anclajes. En este caso, la solución es generar más eventos para compensar la pérdida de anclajes para lograr los requisitos de precisión deseados.• Faltan los nodos objetivo en la secuencia del nodo Hay dos consecuencias cuando faltan los nodos objetivo. Primero, si estos nodos aún son útiles para las aplicaciones de detección, necesitan usar otros enfoques de localización de respaldo (por ejemplo, centroide) para localizarse con la ayuda de sus vecinos que ya han aprendido sus propias ubicaciones de MSP. En segundo lugar, dado que en MSP avanzado, cada nodo en la secuencia puede contribuir a la precisión general del sistema, la caída de los nodos objetivo de las secuencias también podría reducir la precisión de la localización. Por lo tanto, se deben lanzar procedimientos de compensación adecuados, como agregar más eventos de localización.7.2 Localización sin sincronización de tiempo En una red de sensores sin soporte de sincronización de tiempo, los nodos no se pueden ordenar en una secuencia utilizando marcas de tiempo. Para tales casos, proponemos un protocolo de informe de ensamblaje de escucha de escucha, que puede funcionar de forma independiente sin sincronización de tiempo.Listen Detect-Assemble-Informe requiere que cada nodo escuche el canal para la secuencia de nodo transmitida desde sus vecinos. Luego, cuando el nodo detecta el evento de localización, se ensambla en la secuencia del nodo más reciente que ha escuchado e informa la secuencia actualizada a otros nodos. La Figura 12 (a) ilustra un ejemplo para el protocolo de informe de ensamblaje de escucha. Para simplificar, en esta figura no diferenciamos los nodos objetivo de los nodos de anclaje. Una línea continua entre dos nodos representa un enlace de comunicación. Supongamos que una línea recta escanea de izquierda a derecha. El nodo 1 detecta el evento, y luego transmite la secuencia (1) a la red. El nodo 2 y el nodo 3 reciben esta secuencia. Cuando el nodo 2 detecta el evento, el nodo 2 se suma a la secuencia y transmisiones (1, 2). La secuencia se propaga en la misma dirección con el escaneo como se muestra en la Figura 12 (a). Finalmente, el nodo 6 obtiene una secuencia completa (1,2,3,5,7,4,6). En el caso de la propagación de ultrasonido, debido a que la velocidad de propagación de eventos es mucho más lenta que la de la radio, el protocolo Listendetect-Assemble-Informe puede funcionar bien en una situación en la que la densidad del nodo no es muy alta. Por ejemplo, si la distancia entre dos nodos a lo largo de una dirección es de 10 metros, el sonido de 340m/s necesita 29.4 ms para propagarse de un nodo a otro. Si bien normalmente la velocidad de datos de comunicación es de 250 kbps en el WSN (por ejemplo, CC2420 [1]), solo se necesitan aproximadamente 2 ∼ 3 ms para transmitir un paquete ensamblado para un salto. Un problema que puede ocurrir utilizando el protocolo de informe de escucha y detección de informes es múltiples secuencias parciales como se muestra en la Figura 12 (b). Dos rutas separadas en la red pueden dar lugar a dos secuencias que no podrían combinarse más. En este caso, dado que las dos secuencias solo pueden procesarse como secuencias separadas, se pierde cierta información de pedidos. Por lo tanto, los 1,2,5,4 1,3,7,4 1,2,3,5 1,2,3,5,7,4 1,2,3,5,7 1,2,3,51,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,2,3,5,7,4,6 1,2,5 1,3,7 1,3 1,2 1 2 35 7 4 6 1 1 1 1,3,7,4,6 1,2,5,4,6 (a) (b) (c) 1,3,2,5 1,3,2,5,7,4 1,3,2,5,7 1,3,2,5 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,3,2,5,7,4,6 Propagación de eventosPropagación de eventos Propagación del evento Figura 12. La secuencia de nodo sin tiempo de sincronización del sistema disminuiría. El otro problema es el problema de flip de secuencia. Como se muestra en la Figura 12 (c), debido a que el nodo 2 y el nodo 3 están demasiado cerca el uno del otro a lo largo de la dirección del escaneo, detectan el escaneo casi simultáneamente. Debido a la incertidumbre, como el retraso de acceso a los medios, dos mensajes podrían transmitirse fuera de servicio. Por ejemplo, si el nodo 3 envía primero su informe, entonces el orden del nodo 2 y el nodo 3 se voltea en la secuencia del nodo final. El problema de flip de secuencia aparecería incluso en un sistema sincronizado con precisión debido a la fluctuación aleatoria en la detección de nodos si un evento llega a múltiples nodos casi simultáneamente. En la siguiente sección se presenta un método que aborda el Flip de secuencia.7.3 Los problemas de secuencia de secuencia de banda de secuencia y banda de protección se pueden resolver con y sin sincronización de tiempo. En primer lugar, comenzamos con un escenario que aplica la sincronización del tiempo. Las soluciones existentes para la sincronización del tiempo [12, 6] pueden lograr fácilmente la precisión a nivel de subcilos. Por ejemplo, FTSP [12] logra un error promedio de 16.9 µs (microsegundos) para un caso de dos nodo de salto único. Por lo tanto, podemos suponer cómodamente que la red está sincronizada con un error máximo de 1000 µs. Sin embargo, cuando múltiples nodos se encuentran muy cerca uno del otro a lo largo de la dirección de propagación del evento, incluso cuando la sincronización del tiempo con menos de 1 ms de error se logra en la red, la secuencia de secuencia aún puede ocurrir. Por ejemplo, en el caso de propagación de la onda de sonido, si dos nodos están a menos de 0.34 metros de distancia, la diferencia entre su marca de tiempo de detección sería menor que 1 milisegundo. Encontramos que el flip de secuencia no solo podría dañar la precisión del sistema, sino que también puede causar un error fatal en el algoritmo MSP. La Figura 13 ilustra los resultados perjudiciales. En el lado izquierdo de la Figura 13 (a), suponga que el nodo 1 y el nodo 2 están tan cerca el uno del otro que tarda menos de 0.5ms en el evento de localización para propagarse desde el nodo 1 al nodo 2. Ahora, desafortunadamente, la secuencia del nodo se equivoca como (2,1). Por lo tanto, se espera que el nodo 1 se ubique a la derecha del nodo 2, como en la posición del nodo discontinuo 1. De acuerdo con la regla de eliminación en MSP basada en secuencia, la parte izquierda del área del nodo 1 se corta como se muestra en la parte derecha de la Figura 13 (a). Este es un error potencialmente fatal, porque el nodo 1 se encuentra en el área discontinua que ha sido eliminada por error. Durante las eliminaciones posteriores introducidas por otros eventos, el área del nodo 1 podría cortarse por completo, por lo que el nodo 1 podría borrarse del mapa. Incluso en los casos en que el nodo 1 todavía sobrevive, su área en realidad no cubre su ubicación real.22 1 2 12 2 Límite inferior de 1 límite superior de 1 secuencia volcada Error de eliminación fatal Event Propagation 1 1 Error fatal 1 1 2 12 2 Límite inferior de 1 límite superior de 1 secuencia volcada Evento de eliminación segura(A) (B) B: Banda de protección Figura 13. Flip de secuencia y banda de protección Otro problema no es fatal, pero reduce la precisión de localización. Si obtenemos la secuencia del nodo derecha (1,2), el nodo 1 tiene un nuevo límite superior que puede reducir el área del nodo 1 como en la Figura 3. Debido a la secuencia de secuencia, el nodo 1 pierde este nuevo límite superior. Para abordar el problema de flip de secuencia, especialmente para evitar que los nodos se borren del mapa, proponemos un enfoque de compensación de banda de protección. La idea básica de la banda de protección es extender un poco el límite del área de ubicación para asegurarse de que el nodo nunca se borrará del mapa. Esta solución se basa en el hecho de que los nodos tienen una alta probabilidad de voltear en la secuencia si están cerca uno del otro a lo largo de la dirección de propagación del evento. Si dos nodos están separados entre sí más de cierta distancia, digamos, B, rara vez se voltean a menos que los nodos estén defectuosos. El ancho de una banda de protección B, está determinado en gran medida por el error máximo en la sincronización del tiempo del sistema y la velocidad de propagación del evento de localización. La Figura 13 (b) presenta la aplicación de la banda de protección. En lugar de eliminar la parte discontinua en la Figura 13 (a) para el nodo 1, el nuevo límite inferior del nodo 1 se establece cambiando el límite inferior original del nodo 2 a la izquierda por distancia B. En este caso, el área de ubicación aún cubre el nodo 1 y lo protege de ser borrado. En una implementación práctica, suponiendo que se utilice el evento de ultrasonido, si el error máximo de la sincronización del tiempo del sistema es de 1 ms, dos nodos pueden voltear con alta probabilidad si la diferencia de marca de tiempo entre los dos nodos es menor o igual a 1 m. En consecuencia, establecemos la banda de protección B como 0.34m (el sonido de distancia puede propagarse dentro de 1 milisegundo). Al agregar la banda de protección, reducimos las posibilidades de errores fatales, aunque a costa de la precisión de localización. Los resultados empíricos obtenidos de nuestro lecho de prueba física verificaron esta conclusión. En el caso de usar el protocolo de informe de información de escucha de escucha, el único cambio que debemos hacer es seleccionar la banda de protección de acuerdo con la incertidumbre máxima de retraso introducida por la operación MAC y la velocidad de propagación de eventos. Para unir el retraso MAC en el lado del nodo, un nodo puede eliminar su mensaje de informe si experimenta un retraso MAC excesivo. Esto convierte el problema de flip de secuencia en el problema de secuencia incompleta, que puede abordarse más fácilmente por el método propuesto en la Sección 7.1.8 Evaluación de simulación Nuestra evaluación de MSP se realizó en tres plataformas: (i) un sistema interior con 46 Micaz Motes utilizando escaneo en línea recta, (ii) un sistema al aire libre con 20 Micaz Motes usando propagación de onda de sonido y (iii) un extensosimulación bajo varios tipos de configuraciones físicas. Para comprender el comportamiento de MSP en numerosos entornos, comenzamos nuestra evaluación con simulaciones. Luego, implementamos MSP básico y todos los métodos MSP avanzados para el caso donde la sincronización de tiempo está disponible en la red. Los detalles de simulación e implementación se omiten en este documento debido a limitaciones de espacio, pero los documentos relacionados [25] se proporcionan en línea en http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/msp. La implementación completa y la evaluación del sistema sin sincronización de tiempo aún no se han completado en el futuro cercano. En la simulación, suponemos que todas las secuencias de nodo son perfectas para revelar el rendimiento de MSP que se puede lograr en ausencia de secuencias de nodo incompletas o flips de secuencia. En nuestras simulaciones, se supone que todos los nodos de anclaje y los nodos objetivo se implementan de manera uniforme. Los errores medios y máximos se promedian en más de 50 carreras para obtener una alta confianza. Por razones de legibilidad, no trazamos los intervalos de confianza en este documento. Todas las simulaciones se basan en el ejemplo de escaneo de línea recta. Implementamos tres estrategias de escaneo: • Escaneo aleatorio: la pendiente de la línea de escaneo se elige aleatoriamente en cada momento.• Escaneo regular: la pendiente está predeterminada para girar de manera uniforme de 0 grados a 180 grados. Por ejemplo, si el sistema escanea 6 veces, entonces los ángulos de escaneo serían: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 y 150. • Escaneo adaptativo: la pendiente de cada escaneo se determina en función de los resultados de localización de los escaneos anteriores. Comenzamos con MSP básico y luego demostramos las mejoras de rendimiento un paso a la vez agregando (i) MSP basado en secuencia, (ii) MSP iterativo, (iii) DBE MSP y (IV) MSP adaptativo.8.1 Rendimiento de MSP básico La evaluación comienza con MSP básico, donde comparamos el rendimiento del escaneo aleatorio y el escaneo regular en diferentes configuraciones. Tenemos la intención de ilustrar el impacto del número de anclajes m, el número de escaneos D y la densidad del nodo objetivo (número de nodos objetivo n en una región de tamaño fijo) en el error de localización. La Tabla 1 muestra los parámetros de simulación predeterminados. El error de cada nodo se define como la distancia entre la ubicación estimada y la posición real. Observamos que de forma predeterminada solo usamos tres anclajes, que es considerablemente menos que las soluciones sin rango existentes [8, 4]. Impacto del número de escaneos: en este experimento, comparamos una exploración regular con una exploración aleatoria bajo un número diferente de escaneos de 3 a 30 en pasos de 3.

Las mejoras del MSP basado en secuencias sobre MSP básico son 3 de forma predeterminada. La Figura 14 (a) indica lo siguiente: (i) A medida que aumenta el número de escaneos, el error de localización disminuye significativamente;Por ejemplo, los errores de localización disminuyen más del 60% de 3 escaneos a 30 escaneos;(ii) Estadísticamente, el escaneo regular logra un mejor rendimiento que la exploración aleatoria bajo un número idéntico de escaneos. Sin embargo, la brecha de rendimiento se reduce a medida que aumenta el número de escaneos. Esto se espera ya que una gran cantidad de números aleatorios converge a una distribución uniforme. La Figura 14 (a) también demuestra que MSP requiere solo un pequeño número de anclajes para funcionar muy bien, en comparación con las soluciones sin rango existentes [8, 4]. Impacto del número de anclajes: en este experimento, comparamos una exploración regular con una exploración aleatoria bajo diferentes números de anclajes de 3 a 30 en pasos de 3. Los resultados que se muestran en la Figura 14 (b) indican que (i) a medida que aumenta el número de nodos de anclaje, el error de localización disminuye y (ii) estadísticamente, la exploración regular obtiene mejores resultados que la exploración aleatoria con un número idéntico de anclajes. Al combinar las Figuras 14 (a) y 14 (b), podemos concluir que MSP permite una compensación flexible entre el costo físico (nodos de anclaje) y el costo suave (eventos de localización). Impacto de la densidad del nodo objetivo: en este experimento, confirmamos que la densidad de los nodos objetivo no tiene impacto en la precisión, lo que motivó el diseño de MSP basado en secuencias. En este experimento, comparamos una exploración regular con una exploración aleatoria bajo un número diferente de nodos objetivo de 10 a 190 en pasos de 20. Los resultados en la Figura 14 (c) muestran que los errores medios de localización permanecen constantes en diferentes densidades de nodos. Sin embargo, cuando aumenta el número de nodos objetivo, aumenta el error máximo promedio. Resumen: de los experimentos anteriores, podemos concluir que en MSP básico, la exploración regular es mejor que la exploración aleatoria bajo diferentes números de anclajes y eventos de escaneo. Esto se debe a que los escaneos regulares eliminan uniformemente el mapa de diferentes direcciones, mientras que los escaneos aleatorios obtendrían secuencias con información superpuesta redundante, si dos escaneos eligen dos pendientes de escaneo similares.8.2 Mejoras del MSP basado en secuencias Esta sección evalúa los beneficios de explotar la información del pedido entre los nodos objetivo comparando MSP basado en secuencias con MSP básico. En esta y las siguientes secciones, se utiliza un escaneo regular para la generación de eventos de escaneo en línea recta. El propósito de usar una exploración regular es mantener los eventos de escaneo y las secuencias de nodo idénticas para MSP basados en secuencias y MSP básico, de modo que la única diferencia entre ellos es el procedimiento de procesamiento de secuencias. Impacto del número de escaneos: en este experimento, comparamos MSP basado en secuencias con MSP básico bajo diferentes números de escaneos de 3 a 30 en pasos de 3. La Figura 15 (a) indica una mejora significativa del rendimiento en MSP basado en secuencias sobre MSP básico en todas las configuraciones de escaneo, especialmente cuando el número de escaneos es grande. Por ejemplo, cuando el número de escaneos es de 30, los errores en MSP basados en secuencias son aproximadamente el 20% del del MSP básico. Concluimos que el MSP basado en secuencias funciona extremadamente bien cuando hay muchos eventos de escaneo. Impacto del número de anclajes: en este experimento, usamos diferentes números de anclajes de 3 a 30 en pasos de 3. Como se ve en la Figura 15 (b), el error medio y el error máximo de MSP basado en secuencias son mucho más pequeños que el de MSP básico. Especialmente cuando hay un número limitado de anclajes en el sistema, por ejemplo, 3 anclajes, la tasa de error se redujo casi a la mitad utilizando MSP basado en secuencias. Este fenómeno tiene una explicación interesante: las líneas de corte creadas por los nodos de anclaMSP iterativo Error de tiempos iterativos Error máximo de SEQ iterativo MSP Error medio de SEQ iterativo MSP MAX Error de MSP básico Error medio de MSP básico Figura 16.

Las mejoras del número adaptativo de MSP de nodos de anclaje, los anclajes tienden a dominar la contribución. Por lo tanto, las brechas de rendimiento disminuyen. Impacto de la densidad del nodo objetivo: la Figura 15 (c) demuestra los beneficios de explotar la información del pedido entre los nodos objetivo. Dado que MSP basado en secuencias utiliza la información entre los nodos objetivo, tener más nodos de destino contribuye a la precisión general del sistema. A medida que aumenta el número de nodos objetivo, el error medio y el error máximo de MSP basado en la secuencia disminuyen. Claramente, el error medio en MSP básico no se ve afectado por el número de nodos objetivo, como se muestra en la Figura 15 (c). Resumen: de los experimentos anteriores, podemos concluir que explotar la información del pedido entre los nodos objetivo puede mejorar significativamente la precisión, especialmente cuando el número de eventos es grande pero con pocos anclajes.8.3 MSP iterativo sobre MSP basado en secuencias En este experimento, las mismas secuencias de nodo se procesaron de forma iterativamente varias veces. En la Figura 16, las dos marcas individuales son los resultados del MSP básico, ya que el MSP básico no realiza iteraciones. Las dos curvas presentan el rendimiento del MSP iterativo bajo diferentes números de iteraciones c.Observamos que cuando solo se usa una iteración, este método se degrada con el MSP basado en secuencias. Por lo tanto, la Figura 16 compara los tres métodos entre sí. La Figura 16 muestra que la segunda iteración puede reducir drásticamente el error medio y el error máximo. Después de eso, la ganancia de rendimiento se reduce gradualmente, especialmente cuando C> 5. Esto se debe a que la segunda iteración permite que los escaneos anteriores exploten los nuevos límites creados por escaneos posteriores en la primera iteración. Tal explotación decae rápidamente sobre las iteraciones.8.4 DBE MSP sobre MSP iterativo La Figura 17, en la que aumentamos el MSP iterativo con la estimación basada en la distribución (DBE MSP), muestra que DBE MSP podría generar un rendimiento estadísticamente mejor. La Figura 17 presenta errores de localización de distribución acumulativa. En general, las dos curvas del DBE MSP se encuentran ligeramente a la izquierda de la de MSP no DBE, lo que indica que DBE MSP tiene un error medio estadístico más pequeño y un error máximo promedio que el MSP no DBE. Observamos que debido a que DBE se aumenta además de la mejor solución hasta ahora, la mejora del rendimiento no es significativa. Cuando aplicamos DBE en los métodos básicos de MSP, la mejora es mucho más significativa. Omitimos estos resultados debido a las limitaciones de espacio.8.5 Mejoras del MSP adaptativo Esta sección ilustra el rendimiento del MSP adaptativo sobre MSP no adaptativo. Observamos que la adaptación basada en la retroalimentación se puede aplicar a todos los métodos MSP, ya que afecta solo los ángulos de escaneo pero no el procesamiento de secuencia. En este experimento, evaluamos cómo MSP adaptativo puede mejorar la mejor solución hasta ahora. La granularidad del ángulo predeterminado (PASO) para la búsqueda adaptativa es de 5 grados. Impacto de la forma del área: primero, si la configuración del sistema es regular, el método adaptativo apenas contribuye a los resultados. Para un área cuadrada (regular), el rendimiento del MSP adaptativo y los escaneos regulares son muy cercanos. Sin embargo, si la forma del área no es regular, el MSP adaptativo ayuda a elegir los eventos de localización apropiados para compensar. Por lo tanto, el MSP adaptativo puede lograr un mejor error medio y un error máximo como se muestra en la Figura 18 (a). Por ejemplo, el MSP adaptativo mejora la precisión de localización en un 30% cuando el número de nodos objetivo es 10. Impacto de la densidad del nodo objetivo: la Figura 18 (a) muestra que cuando la densidad del nodo es baja, el MSP adaptativo brinda más beneficio que cuando la densidad del nodo es alta. Este fenómeno tiene sentido estadístico, porque la ley de grandes números nos dice que la colocación de nodos aborda una distribución verdaderamente uniforme cuando aumenta el número de nodos. Adaptive MSP tiene un borde 25 Figura 19. El lecho de prueba de Mirage (escaneo de línea) Figura 20. Los experimentos al aire libre de 20 nodos (Wave) cuando el diseño no es uniforme. Impacto de la densidad del ángulo candidato: la Figura 18 (b) muestra que cuanto más pequeño sea el paso del ángulo de escaneo candidato, mejor será el rendimiento estadístico en términos de error medio. La justificación es clara, ya que los ángulos de escaneo candidato más amplios brindan a MSP adaptativo más oportunidades para elegir el que se acerca al ángulo óptimo.8.6 Resumen de simulación A partir de MSP básico, hemos demostrado paso-bystep cómo se pueden aplicar cuatro optimizaciones una encima de la otra para mejorar el rendimiento de la localización. En otras palabras, estas optimizaciones son compatibles entre sí y pueden mejorar conjuntamente el rendimiento general. Observamos que nuestras simulaciones se hicieron bajo suponiendo que la secuencia del nodo completo se puede obtener sin flips de secuencia. En la siguiente sección, presentamos dos implementaciones del sistema real que revelan y abordan estos problemas prácticos.9 Evaluación del sistema En esta sección, presentamos una implementación del sistema de MSP en dos campos de pruebas físicas. El primero se llama Mirage, una gran cama de prueba interior compuesta de seis tablas de 4 pies por 8 pies, ilustrada en la Figura 19. Cada placa del sistema se puede usar como un subsistema individual, que se alimenta, controla y se mide por separado. Se utilizan tres proyectores Hitachi CP-X1250, conectados a través de un cuadro de expansión de Gráficos Triplehead2Go de Maturex, se utilizan para crear una pantalla integrada ultra ancha en seis tableros. La Figura 19 muestra que los proyectores generan una larga línea inclinada. Hemos implementado las cinco versiones de MSP en el lecho de prueba de Mirage, con 46 Micaz Motes. A menos que se mencione lo contrario, la configuración predeterminada es de 3 anclajes y 6 escaneos a la velocidad de la línea de escaneo de 8.6 pies/s. En todos nuestros gráficos, cada punto de datos representa el valor promedio de 50 pruebas. En el sistema exterior, se utiliza un altavoz Dell A525 para generar un sonido de 4.7 kHz como se muestra en la Figura 20. Colocamos 20 Micaz Motes en el patio trasero de una casa. Dado que la ubicación no está completamente abierta, las ondas de sonido se reflejan, dispersan y absorben por varios objetos en la vecindad, causando un efecto múltiple. En la evaluación del sistema, se aplican mecanismos de sincronización de tiempo simple en cada nodo.9.1 Evaluación del sistema interior Durante los experimentos en interiores, encontramos varios problemas del mundo real que no se revelan en la simulación. Primero, las secuencias obtenidas fueron parciales debido a la decetección errónea y las pérdidas de mensajes. En segundo lugar, los elementos en las secuencias podrían voltear debido al retraso de detección, incertidumbre en el acceso a los medios o un error en la sincronización del tiempo. Mostramos que estos problemas pueden abordarse utilizando el método de banda de protección descrito en la Sección 7.3.9.1.1 En la velocidad de escaneo y la banda de protección En este experimento, estudiamos el impacto de la velocidad de escaneo y la longitud de la banda de protección en el rendimiento del sistema. En general, con una velocidad de escaneo creciente, los nodos tienen menos tiempo para responder al evento y la brecha de tiempo entre dos nodos adyacentes se reducen, lo que lleva a un número creciente de secuencias parciales y volteos de secuencia. La Figura 21 muestra las situaciones de flip de nodo para seis escaneos con ángulos distintos bajo diferentes velocidades de escaneo. El eje X muestra la distancia entre los nodos invertidos en la secuencia del nodo correcta.El eje Y muestra el número total de flips en los seis escaneos. Esta cifra nos dice que el escaneo más rápido no solo aumenta el número de flips, sino también de los flips de mayor distancia que requieren una banda de protección más amplia para evitar errores fatales. La Figura 22 (a) muestra la efectividad de la banda de protección en términos de reducir el número de nodos no calculados. Cuando usamos una velocidad de escaneo moderada (4.3 pies/s), la posibilidad de voltear es rara, por lo tanto, podemos lograr una precisión media de 0.45 pies (Figura 22 (b)) con un error máximo de 1.6 pies (Figura 22 (c)). Con el aumento de las velocidades, la banda de protección debe establecerse en un valor mayor para lidiar con el volteo. Se pueden observar fenómenos interesantes en las Figuras 22: por un lado, la banda de protección puede reducir bruscamente el número de nodos no calculados;Por otro lado, las bandas de protección amplían el área en la que un objetivo potencialmente residiría, introduciendo más incertidumbre. Por lo tanto, hay una curva cóncava para el error medio y máximo cuando la velocidad de escaneo está a 8.6 pies/s.9.1.2 En los métodos MSP y la banda de protección En este experimento, mostramos las mejoras resultantes de tres métodos diferentes. La Figura 23 (a) muestra que una banda de protección de 0.35 pies es suficiente para la velocidad de escaneo de 8.57 pies/s. Las Figuras 23 (b) y 23 (c) muestran claramente que el MSP iterativo (con adaptación) logra el mejor rendimiento. Por ejemplo, las Figuras 23 (b) muestran que cuando colocamos la banda de protección a 0.05 pies, el MSP iterativo alcanza la precisión de 0.7 pies, que es 42% más precisa que el diseño básico. Del mismo modo, las Figuras 23 (b) y 23 (c) muestran los efectos de doble filo de la banda de protección en la precisión de localización.0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (3) Distribución de flip para 6 escaneos a una velocidad de línea de 14.6 pies/s Flips Distancia del nodo en la secuencia del nodo ideal 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (2) Distribución de flip para 6 escaneos en líneaVelocidad de 8.6 pies/s Flips 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (1) Distribución de flip para 6 escaneos a velocidad de línea de 4.3 pies/s flips Figura 21.

Impacto del número de anclajes y escaneos 9.1.3 En el número de anclajes y escaneos en este experimento, mostramos una compensación entre el costo de hardware (anclajes) con costo suave (eventos). La Figura 24 (a) muestra que con más líneas de corte creadas por anclajes, la posibilidad de nodos no calculados aumenta ligeramente. Observamos que con una banda de protección de 0.35 pies, el porcentaje de nodos no calculados es muy pequeño, por ejemplo, en el peor de los casos con 11 anclajes, solo 2 de 46 nodos no se localizan debido al volteo. Las Figuras 24 (b) y 24 (c) muestran la compensación entre el número de anclajes y el número de escaneos. Obviamente, con el número de anclajes, el error cae significativamente. Con 11 anclajes podemos lograr una precisión de localización tan baja como 0.25 ∼ 0.35 pies, que es una mejora de casi el 60%. Del mismo modo, con un número creciente de escaneos, la precisión también cae significativamente. Podemos observar alrededor del 30% en todas las configuraciones de anclaje cuando aumentamos el número de escaneos de 4 a 8. Por ejemplo, con solo 3 anclajes, podemos lograr una precisión de 0.6 pies con 8 escaneos.9.2 Evaluación del sistema exterior La evaluación del sistema exterior contiene dos partes: (i) Evaluación efectiva de la distancia de detección, que muestra que la secuencia del nodo se puede obtener fácilmente, y (ii) localización basada en la propagación de sonido, que muestra los resultados de la localización basada en la propagación de onda.9.2.1 Evaluación efectiva de la distancia de detección Evaluamos en primer lugar el fenómeno de flip de secuencia en la propagación de onda. Como se muestra en la Figura 25, se colocaron 20 motas como cinco grupos frente al altavoz, cuatro nodos en cada grupo a aproximadamente las mismas distancias al altavoz. La brecha entre cada grupo se establece en 2, 3, 4 y 5 pies respectivamente en cuatro experimentos. La figura 26 muestra los resultados. El eje X en cada subgrafio indica el índice de grupo. Hay cuatro nodos en cada grupo (4 barras). El eje y muestra el rango de detección (orden) de cada nodo en la secuencia del nodo. A medida que aumenta la distancia entre cada grupo, el número de flips en la secuencia del nodo resultante 27 Figura 25.

El error de localización (sonido) disminuye. Por ejemplo, en el subgrafo de distancia de 2 pies, hay bastantes volteos entre los nodos en grupos adyacentes e incluso no adyacentes, mientras que en el subgrafio de 5 pies, las volteidades entre diferentes grupos desaparecieron en la prueba.9.2.2 Localización basada en la propagación del sonido Como se muestra en la Figura 20, 20 motas se colocan como una cuadrícula que incluye 5 filas con 5 pies entre cada fila y 4 columnas con 4 pies entre cada columna. Un orador generan seis eventos de propagación de onda acústica de 4kHz alrededor de la cuadrícula de mote. La Figura 27 muestra los resultados de localización utilizando MSP iterativo (3 veces procesamiento iterativo) con una banda de protección de 3 pies. El error promedio de los resultados de la localización es de 3 pies y el error máximo es de 5 pies con un nodo no localizado. Encontramos que la secuencia de propagación de onda es más severa que la de la prueba interior basada en la línea. Esto se espera debido a la alta velocidad de propagación del sonido. Actualmente usamos Micaz Mote, que está equipado con un micrófono de baja calidad. Creemos que utilizando un mejor altavoz y más eventos, el sistema puede producir una mejor precisión. A pesar de las restricciones de hardware, el algoritmo MSP todavía localizó con éxito la mayoría de los nodos con buena precisión.10 Conclusiones En este documento, presentamos el primer trabajo que explota el concepto de procesamiento de secuencia de nodos para localizar los nodos de los sensores. Demostramos que podríamos mejorar significativamente la precisión de localización al hacer un uso completo de la información integrada en múltiples secuencias de nodos unidimensionales fáciles de obtener. Propusimos cuatro métodos de optimización novedosos, explotando el orden y la distribución marginal entre los nodos que no son de ampliación, así como la información de retroalimentación de los resultados de la localización temprana. Es importante destacar que estos métodos de optimización se pueden usar juntos y mejorar la precisión aditiva. Los problemas prácticos de secuencia de nodo parcial y flip de secuencia se identificaron y abordaron en dos lechos de pruebas de sistemas físicos. También evaluamos el rendimiento a escala a través del análisis, así como simulaciones extensas. Los resultados demuestran que no exigir ningún hardware costoso en los nodos de sensores ni la distribución precisa de eventos, MSP puede lograr una precisión de subfunes con muy pocos nodos de anclaje proporcionados eventos suficientes.11 Referencias [1] Hoja de datos CC2420.

        "Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes, a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost, energy and effective range of sensor devices.",
        "To overcome limitations in existing solutions, we present a Multi-Sequence Positioning (MSP) method for large-scale stationary sensor node localization in outdoor environments.",
        "The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two-dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences, easily obtained through loosely guided event distribution.",
        "Starting from a basic MSP design, we propose four optimizations, which work together to increase the localization accuracy.",
        "We address several interesting issues, such as incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the Mirage test-bed we built.",
        "We have evaluated the MSP system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 MICAz motes and an outdoor version with 20 MICAz motes).",
        "This evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.",
        "It also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer Communications Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Design, Performance, Experimentation 1 Introduction Although Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have shown promising prospects in various applications [5], researchers still face several challenges for massive deployment of such networks.",
        "One of these is to identify the location of individual sensor nodes in outdoor environments.",
        "Because of unpredictable flow dynamics in airborne scenarios, it is not currently feasible to localize sensor nodes during massive UVA-based deployment.",
        "On the other hand, geometric information is indispensable in these networks, since users need to know where events of interest occur (e.g., the location of intruders or of a bomb explosion).",
        "Previous research on node localization falls into two categories: range-based approaches and range-free approaches.",
        "Range-based approaches [13, 17, 19, 24] compute per-node location information iteratively or recursively based on measured distances among target nodes and a few anchors which precisely know their locations.",
        "These approaches generally require costly hardware (e.g., GPS) and have limited effective range due to energy constraints (e.g., ultrasound-based TDOA [3, 17]).",
        "Although range-based solutions can be suitably used in small-scale indoor environments, they are considered less cost-effective for large-scale deployments.",
        "On the other hand, range-free approaches [4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15] do not require accurate distance measurements, but localize the node based on network connectivity (proximity) information.",
        "Unfortunately, since wireless connectivity is highly influenced by the environment and hardware calibration, existing solutions fail to deliver encouraging empirical results, or require substantial survey [2] and calibration [24] on a case-by-case basis.",
        "Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment, researchers have recently proposed solutions (e.g., Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18]) for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal correlation of controlled events (i.e., inferring nodes locations based on the detection time of controlled events).",
        "These solutions demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at sensor nodes.",
        "These benefits, however, come along with an implicit assumption that the controlled events can be precisely distributed to a specified location at a specified time.",
        "We argue that precise event distribution is difficult to achieve, especially at large scale when terrain is uneven, the event distribution device is not well calibrated and its position is difficult to maintain (e.g., the helicopter-mounted scenario in [20]).",
        "To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.",
        "The novel idea behind MSP is to estimate each sensor nodes two-dimensional location by processing multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences (e.g., event detection order) obtained through loosely-guided event distribution.",
        "This design offers several benefits.",
        "First, compared to a range-based approach, MSP does not require additional costly hardware.",
        "It works using sensors typically used by sensor network applications, such as light and acoustic sensors, both of which we specifically consider in this work.",
        "Second, compared to a range-free approach, MSP needs only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two), so high accuracy can be achieved economically by introducing more events instead of more anchors.",
        "And third, compared to Spotlight, MSP does not require precise and sophisticated event distribution, an advantage that significantly simplifies the system design and reduces calibration cost.",
        "This paper offers the following additional intellectual contributions: • We are the first to localize sensor nodes using the concept of node sequence, an ordered list of sensor nodes, sorted by the detection time of a disseminated event.",
        "We demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly improve localization accuracy.",
        "Interestingly, we discover that repeated reprocessing of one-dimensional node sequences can further increase localization accuracy. • We propose a distribution-based location estimation strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using the marginal probability of joint distribution among adjacent nodes within the sequence.",
        "This new algorithm outperforms the widely adopted Centroid estimation [4, 8]. • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events.",
        "The generation of later events is guided by localization results from previous events. • We evaluate line-based MSP on our new Mirage test-bed, and wave-based MSP in outdoor environments.",
        "Through system implementation, we discover and address several interesting issues such as partial sequence and sequence flips.",
        "To reveal MSP performance at scale, we provide analytic results as well as a complete simulation study.",
        "All the simulation and implementation code is available online at http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/MSP.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly surveys the related work.",
        "Section 3 presents an overview of the MSP localization system.",
        "In sections 4 and 5, basic MSP and four advanced processing methods are introduced.",
        "Section 6 describes how MSP can be applied in a wave propagation scenario.",
        "Section 7 discusses several implementation issues.",
        "Section 8 presents simulation results, and Section 9 reports an evaluation of MSP on the Mirage test-bed and an outdoor test-bed.",
        "Section 10 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work Many methods have been proposed to localize wireless sensor devices in the open air.",
        "Most of these can be classified into two categories: range-based and range-free localization.",
        "Range-based localization systems, such as GPS [23], Cricket [17], AHLoS [19], AOA [16], Robust Quadrilaterals [13] and Sweeps [7], are based on fine-grained point-topoint distance estimation or angle estimation to identify pernode location.",
        "Constraints on the cost, energy and hardware footprint of each sensor node make these range-based methods undesirable for massive outdoor deployment.",
        "In addition, ranging signals generated by sensor nodes have a very limited effective range because of energy and form factor concerns.",
        "For example, ultrasound signals usually effectively propagate 20-30 feet using an on-board transmitter [17].",
        "Consequently, these range-based solutions require an undesirably high deployment density.",
        "Although the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) related [2, 24] methods were once considered an ideal low-cost solution, the irregularity of radio propagation [26] seriously limits the accuracy of such systems.",
        "The recently proposed RIPS localization system [11] superimposes two RF waves together, creating a low-frequency envelope that can be accurately measured.",
        "This ranging technique performs very well as long as antennas are well oriented and environmental factors such as multi-path effects and background noise are sufficiently addressed.",
        "Range-free methods dont need to estimate or measure accurate distances or angles.",
        "Instead, anchors or controlled-event distributions are used for node localization.",
        "Range-free methods can be generally classified into two types: anchor-based and anchor-free solutions. • For anchor-based solutions such as Centroid [4], APIT [8], SeRLoc [10], Gradient [13] , and APS [15], the main idea is that the location of each node is estimated based on the known locations of the anchor nodes.",
        "Different anchor combinations narrow the areas in which the target nodes can possibly be located.",
        "Anchor-based solutions normally require a high density of anchor nodes so as to achieve good accuracy.",
        "In practice, it is desirable to have as few anchor nodes as possible so as to lower the system cost. • Anchor-free solutions require no anchor nodes.",
        "Instead, external event generators and data processing platforms are used.",
        "The main idea is to correlate the event detection time at a sensor node with the known space-time relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection time-stamps can be mapped into the locations of sensors.",
        "Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18] work in this fashion.",
        "In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be precise in both time and space.",
        "Precise event distribution is difficult to achieve without careful calibration, especially when the event-generating devices require certain mechanical maneuvers (e.g., the telescope mount used in Spotlight).",
        "All these increase system cost and reduce localization speed.",
        "StarDust [21], which works much faster, uses label relaxation algorithms to match light spots reflected by corner-cube retro-reflectors (CCR) with sensor nodes using various constraints.",
        "Label relaxation algorithms converge only when a sufficient number of robust constraints are obtained.",
        "Due to the environmental impact on RF connectivity constraints, however, StarDust is less accurate than Spotlight.",
        "In this paper, we propose a balanced solution that avoids the limitations of both anchor-based and anchor-free solutions.",

        "The MSP System Overview cost (localization events).",
        "MSP uses only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two).",
        "Unlike anchor-free solutions, MSP doesnt need to maintain rigid time-space relationships while distributing events, which makes system design simpler, more flexible and more robust to calibration errors. 3 System Overview MSP works by extracting relative location information from multiple simple one-dimensional orderings of nodes.",
        "Figure 1(a) shows a layout of a sensor network with anchor nodes and target nodes.",
        "Target nodes are defined as the nodes to be localized.",
        "Briefly, the MSP system works as follows.",
        "First, events are generated one at a time in the network area (e.g., ultrasound propagations from different locations, laser scans with diverse angles).",
        "As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time instance.",
        "For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node sequence.",
        "Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).",
        "Finally, a distributionbased estimation method estimates the exact location of each sensor node, as shown in Figure 1(d).",
        "Figure 1 shows that the node sequences can be obtained much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via ranging methods.",
        "In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]).",
        "For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: • Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9]. • Realistic Deployment, in which (i) node sequences can be partial (incomplete), (ii) elements in sequences could flip (i.e., the order obtained is reversed from reality), and (iii) nodes are not time-synchronized.",
        "To introduce the MSP algorithm, we first consider a simple straight-line scan scenario.",
        "Then, we describe how to implement straight-line scans as well as other event types, such as sound wave propagation. 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 8 1 5 A 6 C 4 3 7 2 B 9 3 1 C 5 9 2 A 4 6 B 7 8 Target node Anchor node Figure 2.",
        "Obtaining Multiple Node Sequences 4 Basic MSP Let us consider a sensor network with N target nodes and M anchor nodes randomly deployed in an area of size S. The top-level idea for basic MSP is to split the whole sensor network area into small pieces by processing node sequences.",
        "Because the exact locations of all the anchors in a node sequence are known, all the nodes in this sequence can be divided into O(M +1) parts in the area.",
        "In Figure 2, we use numbered circles to denote target nodes and numbered hexagons to denote anchor nodes.",
        "Basic MSP uses two straight lines to scan the area from different directions, treating each scan as an event.",
        "All the nodes react to the event sequentially generating two node sequences.",
        "For vertical scan 1, the node sequence is (8,1,5,A,6,C,4,3,7,2,B,9), as shown outside the right boundary of the area in Figure 2; for horizontal scan 2, the node sequence is (3,1,C,5,9,2,A,4,6,B,7,8), as shown under the bottom boundary of the area in Figure 2.",
        "Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "To extend this process, suppose we have M anchor nodes and perform d scans from different angles, obtaining d node sequences and dividing the area into many small parts.",
        "Obviously, the number of parts is a function of the number of anchors M, the number of scans d, the anchors location as well as the slop k for each scan line.",
        "According to the pie-cutting theorem [22], the area can be divided into O(M2d2) parts.",
        "When M and d are appropriately large, the polygon for each target node may become sufficiently small so that accurate estimation can be achieved.",
        "We emphasize that accuracy is affected not only by the number of anchors M, but also by the number of events d. In other words, MSP provides a tradeoff between the physical cost of anchors and the soft cost of events.",
        "Algorithm 1 depicts the computing architecture of basic MSP.",
        "Each node sequence is processed within line 1 to 8.",
        "For each node, GetBoundaries() in line 5 searches for the predecessor and successor anchors in the sequence so as to determine the boundaries of this node.",
        "Then in line 6 UpdateMap() shrinks the location area of this node according to the newly obtained boundaries.",
        "After processing all sequences, Centroid Estimation (line 11) set the center of gravity of the final polygon as the estimated location of the target node.",
        "Basic MSP only makes use of the order information between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.",
        "Actually, we can extract much more location information from 17 Algorithm 1 Basic MSP Process Output: The estimated location of each node. 1: repeat 2: GetOneUnprocessedSeqence(); 3: repeat 4: GetOneNodeFromSequenceInOrder(); 5: GetBoundaries(); 6: UpdateMap(); 7: until All the target nodes are updated; 8: until All the node sequences are processed; 9: repeat 10: GetOneUnestimatedNode(); 11: CentroidEstimation(); 12: until All the target nodes are estimated; each sequence.",
        "Section 5 will introduce advanced MSP, in which four novel optimizations are proposed to improve the performance of MSP significantly. 5 Advanced MSP Four improvements to basic MSP are proposed in this section.",
        "The first three improvements do not need additional sensing and communication in the networks but require only slightly more off-line computation.",
        "The objective of all these improvements is to make full use of the information embedded in the node sequences.",
        "The results we have obtained empirically indicate that the implementation of the first two methods can dramatically reduce the localization error, and that the third and fourth methods are helpful for some system deployments. 5.1 Sequence-Based MSP As shown in Figure 2, each scan line and M anchors, splits the whole area into M + 1 parts.",
        "Each target node falls into one polygon shaped by scan lines.",
        "We noted that in basic MSP, only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each target node, but actually there is more information in the node sequence that we can made use of.",
        "Lets first look at a simple example shown in Figure 3.",
        "The previous scans narrow the locations of target node 1 and node 2 into two dashed rectangles shown in the left part of Figure 3.",
        "Then a new scan generates a new sequence (1, 2).",
        "With knowledge of the scans direction, it is easy to tell that node 1 is located to the left of node 2.",
        "Thus, we can further narrow the location area of node 2 by eliminating the shaded part of node 2s rectangle.",
        "This is because node 2 is located on the right of node 1 while the shaded area is outside the lower boundary of node 1.",
        "Similarly, the location area of node 1 can be narrowed by eliminating the shaded part out of node 2s right boundary.",
        "We call this procedure sequence-based MSP which means that the whole node sequence needs to be processed node by node in order.",
        "Specifically, sequence-based MSP follows this exact processing rule: 1 2 1 2 1 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Lower boundary of 2 Upper boundary of 2 New sequence New upper boundary of 1 New Lower boundary of 2 EventPropagation Figure 3.",
        "Rule Illustration in Sequence Based MSP Algorithm 2 Sequence-Based MSP Process Output: The estimated location of each node. 1: repeat 2: GetOneUnprocessedSeqence(); 3: repeat 4: GetOneNodeByIncreasingOrder(); 5: ComputeLowbound(); 6: UpdateMap(); 7: until The last target node in the sequence; 8: repeat 9: GetOneNodeByDecreasingOrder(); 10: ComputeUpbound(); 11: UpdateMap(); 12: until The last target node in the sequence; 13: until All the node sequences are processed; 14: repeat 15: GetOneUnestimatedNode(); 16: CentroidEstimation(); 17: until All the target nodes are estimated; Elimination Rule: Along a scanning direction, the lower boundary of the successors area must be equal to or larger than the lower boundary of the predecessors area, and the upper boundary of the predecessors area must be equal to or smaller than the upper boundary of the successors area.",
        "In the case of Figure 3, node 2 is the successor of node 1, and node 1 is the predecessor of node 2.",
        "According to the elimination rule, node 2s lower boundary cannot be smaller than that of node 1 and node 1s upper boundary cannot exceed node 2s upper boundary.",
        "Algorithm 2 illustrates the pseudo code of sequence-based MSP.",
        "Each node sequence is processed within line 3 to 13.",
        "The sequence processing contains two steps: Step 1 (line 3 to 7): Compute and modify the lower boundary for each target node by increasing order in the node sequence.",
        "Each nodes lower boundary is determined by the lower boundary of its predecessor node in the sequence, thus the processing must start from the first node in the sequence and by increasing order.",
        "Then update the map according to the new lower boundary.",
        "Step 2 (line 8 to 12): Compute and modify the upper boundary for each node by decreasing order in the node sequence.",
        "Each nodes upper boundary is determined by the upper boundary of its successor node in the sequence, thus the processing must start from the last node in the sequence and by decreasing order.",
        "Then update the map according to the new upper boundary.",
        "After processing all the sequences, for each node, a polygon bounding its possible location has been found.",
        "Then, center-ofgravity-based estimation is applied to compute the exact location of each node (line 14 to 17).",
        "An example of this process is shown in Figure 4.",
        "The third scan generates the node sequence (B,9,2,7,4,6,3,8,C,A,5,1).",
        "In addition to the anchor split lines, because nodes 4 and 7 come after node 2 in the sequence, node 4 and 7s polygons could be narrowed according to node 2s lower boundary (the lower right-shaded area); similarly, the shaded area in node 2s rectangle could be eliminated since this part is beyond node 7s upper boundary indicated by the dotted line.",
        "Similar eliminating can be performed for node 3 as shown in the figure. 18 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 Straight-line Scan 3 Target node Anchor node Figure 4.",

        "Iterative MSP: Reprocessing Scan 1 From above, we can see that the sequence-based MSP makes use of the information embedded in every sequential node pair in the node sequence.",
        "The polygon boundaries of the target nodes obtained in prior could be used to further split other target nodes areas.",
        "Our evaluation in Sections 8 and 9 shows that sequence-based MSP considerably enhances system accuracy. 5.2 Iterative MSP Sequence-based MSP is preferable to basic MSP because it extracts more information from the node sequence.",
        "In fact, further useful information still remains!",
        "In sequence-based MSP, a sequence processed later benefits from information produced by previously processed sequences (e.g., the third scan in Figure 5).",
        "However, the first several sequences can hardly benefit from other scans in this way.",
        "Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose iterative MSP.",
        "The basic idea of iterative MSP is to process all the sequences iteratively several times so that the processing of each single sequence can benefit from the results of other sequences.",
        "To illustrate the idea more clearly, Figure 4 shows the results of three scans that have provided three sequences.",
        "Now if we process the sequence (8,1,5,A,6,C,4,3,7,2,B,9) obtained from scan 1 again, we can make progress, as shown in Figure 5.",
        "The reprocessing of the node sequence 1 provides information in the way an additional vertical scan would.",
        "From sequencebased MSP, we know that the upper boundaries of nodes 3 and 4 along the scan direction must not extend beyond the upper boundary of node 7, therefore the grid parts can be eliminated (a) Central of Gravity (b) Joint Distribution 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 Figure 6.",

        "The implementation of iterative MSP is straightforward: process all the sequences multiple times using sequence-based MSP.",
        "Like sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP introduces no additional event cost.",
        "In other words, reprocessing does not actually repeat the scan physically.",
        "Evaluation results in Section 8 will show that iterative MSP contributes noticeably to a lower localization error.",
        "Empirical results show that after 5 iterations, improvements become less significant.",
        "In summary, iterative processing can achieve better performance with only a small computation overhead. 5.3 Distribution-Based Estimation After determining the location area polygon for each node, estimation is needed for a final decision.",
        "Previous research mostly applied the Center of Gravity (COG) method [4] [8] [10] which minimizes average error.",
        "If every node is independent of all others, COG is the statistically best solution.",
        "In MSP, however, each node may not be independent.",
        "For example, two neighboring nodes in a certain sequence could have overlapping polygon areas.",
        "In this case, if the marginal probability of joint distribution is used for estimation, better statistical results are achieved.",
        "Figure 6 shows an example in which node 1 and node 2 are located in the same polygon.",
        "If COG is used, both nodes are localized at the same position (Figure 6(a)).",
        "However, the node sequences obtained from two scans indicate that node 1 should be to the left of and above node 2, as shown in Figure 6(b).",
        "The high-level idea of distribution-based estimation proposed for MSP, which we call DBE MSP, is illustrated in Figure 7.",
        "The distributions of each node under the ith scan (for the ith node sequence) are estimated in node.vmap[i], which is a data structure for remembering the marginal distribution over scan i.",
        "Then all the vmaps are combined to get a single map and weighted estimation is used to obtain the final location.",
        "For each scan, all the nodes are sorted according to the gap, which is the diameter of the polygon along the direction of the scan, to produce a second, gap-based node sequence.",
        "Then, the estimation starts from the node with the smallest gap.",
        "This is because it is statistically more accurate to assume a uniform distribution of the node with smaller gap.",
        "For each node processed in order from the gap-based node sequence, either if 19 Pred. nodes area Predecessor node exists: conditional distribution based on pred. nodes area Alone: Uniformly Distributed Succ. nodes area Successor node exists: conditional distribution based on succ. nodes area Succ. nodes area Both predecessor and successor nodes exist: conditional distribution based on both of them Pred. nodes area Figure 8.",
        "Four Cases in DBE Process no neighbor node in the original event-based node sequence shares an overlapping area, or if the neighbors have not been processed due to bigger gaps, a uniform distribution Uniform() is applied to this isolated node (the Alone case in Figure 8).",
        "If the distribution of its neighbors sharing overlapped areas has been processed, we calculate the joint distribution for the node.",
        "As shown in Figure 8, there are three possible cases depending on whether the distribution of the overlapping predecessor and/or successor nodes have/has already been estimated.",
        "The estimations strategy of starting from the most accurate node (smallest gap node) reduces the problem of estimation error propagation.",
        "The results in the evaluation section indicate that applying distribution-based estimation could give statistically better results. 5.4 Adaptive MSP So far, all the enhancements to basic MSP focus on improving the multi-sequence processing algorithm given a fixed set of scan directions.",
        "All these enhancements require only more computing time without any overhead to the sensor nodes.",
        "Obviously, it is possible to have some choice and optimization on how events are generated.",
        "For example, in military situations, artillery or rocket-launched mini-ultrasound bombs can be used for event generation at some selected locations.",
        "In adaptive MSP, we carefully generate each new localization event so as to maximize the contribution of the new event to the refinement of localization, based on feedback from previous events.",
        "Figure 9 depicts the basic architecture of adaptive MSP.",
        "Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas.",
        "The idea of adaptive MSP is to generate the next localization event to achieve best-effort elimination, which ideally could shrink the location area of individual node as much as possible.",
        "We use a weighted voting mechanism to evaluate candidate localization events.",
        "Every node wants the next event to split its area evenly, which would shrink the area fast.",
        "Therefore, every node votes for the parameters of the next event (e.g., the scan angle k of the straight-line scan).",
        "Since the area map is maintained centrally, the vote is virtually done and there is no need for the real sensor nodes to participate in it.",
        "After gathering all the voting results, the event parameters with the most votes win the election.",
        "There are two factors that determine the weight of each vote: • The vote for each candidate event is weighted according to the diameter D of the nodes location area.",
        "Nodes with bigger location areas speak louder in the voting, because Map Partitioned by the Localization Events Diameter of Each Area Candidate Localization Events Evaluation Trigger Next Localization Evet Figure 9.",

        "Candidate Slops for Node 3 at Anchor 1 overall system error is reduced mostly by splitting the larger areas. • The vote for each candidate event is also weighted according to its elimination efficiency for a location area, which is defined as how equally in size (or in diameter) an event can cut an area.",
        "In other words, an optimal scan event cuts an area in the middle, since this cut shrinks the area quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly.",
        "Combining the above two aspects, the weight for each vote is computed according to the following equation (1): Weight(k j i ) = f(Di,△(k j i ,k opt i )) (1) k j i is node is jth supporting parameter for next event generation; Di is diameter of node is location area; △(k j i ,k opt i ) is the distance between k j i and the optimal parameter k opt i for node i, which should be defined to fit the specific application.",
        "Figure 10 presents an example for node 1s voting for the slopes of the next straight-line scan.",
        "In the system, there are a fixed number of candidate slopes for each scan (e.g., k1,k2,k3,k4...).",
        "The location area of target node 3 is shown in the figure.",
        "The candidate events k1 3,k2 3,k3 3,k4 3,k5 3,k6 3 are evaluated according to their effectiveness compared to the optimal ideal event which is shown as a dotted line with appropriate weights computed according to equation (1).",
        "For this specific example, as is illustrated in the right part of Figure 10, f(Di,△(k j i ,kopt i )) is defined as the following equation (2): Weight(kj i ) = f(Di,△(kj i ,kopt i )) = Di · Ssmall Slarge (2) Ssmall and Slarge are the sizes of the smaller part and larger part of the area cut by the candidate line respectively.",
        "In this case, node 3 votes 0 for the candidate lines that do not cross its area since Ssmall = 0.",
        "We show later that adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy in WSNs with irregularly shaped deployment areas. 20 5.5 Overhead and MSP Complexity Analysis This section provides a complexity analysis of the MSP design.",
        "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
        "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
        "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
        "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
        "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
        "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
        "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
        "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
        "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
        "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
        "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
        "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
        "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
        "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
        "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
        "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
        "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
        "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
        "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",
        "Example of Wave Propagation Situation • Under the situation of line-of-sight, we allow obstacles to reflect or deflect the wave.",
        "Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.",
        "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
        "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
        "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
        "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
        "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
        "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
        "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
        "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
        "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
        "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
        "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
        "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
        "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
        "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
        "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
        "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
        "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
        "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
        "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
        "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
        "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
        "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
        "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
        "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
        "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
        "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",
        "A solid line between two nodes stands for a communication link.",
        "Suppose a straight line scans from left to right.",
        "Node 1 detects the event, and then it broadcasts the sequence (1) into the network.",
        "Node 2 and node 3 receive this sequence.",
        "When node 2 detects the event, node 2 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts (1, 2).",
        "The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a).",
        "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
        "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
        "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
        "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",
        "One problem that may occur using the listen-detectassemble-report protocol is multiple partial sequences as shown in Figure 12 (b).",
        "Two separate paths in the network may result in two sequences that could not be further combined.",
        "In this case, since the two sequences can only be processed as separate sequences, some order information is lost.",
        "Therefore the 1,2,5,4 1,3,7,4 1,2,3,5 1,2,3,5,7,4 1,2,3,5,7 1,2,3,5 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,2,3,5,7,4,6 1,2,5 1,3,7 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3,7,4,6 1,2,5,4,6 (a) (b) (c) 1,3,2,5 1,3,2,5,7,4 1,3,2,5,7 1,3,2,5 1,3 1,2 1 2 3 5 7 4 6 1 1 1,3 1,3,2,5,7,4,6 Event Propagation Event Propagation Event Propagation Figure 12.",
        "Node Sequence without Time Synchronization accuracy of the system would decrease.",
        "The other problem is the sequence flip problem.",
        "As shown in Figure 12 (c), because node 2 and node 3 are too close to each other along the scan direction, they detect the scan almost simultaneously.",
        "Due to the uncertainty such as media access delay, two messages could be transmitted out of order.",
        "For example, if node 3 sends out its report first, then the order of node 2 and node 3 gets flipped in the final node sequence.",
        "The sequence flip problem would appear even in an accurately synchronized system due to random jitter in node detection if an event arrives at multiple nodes almost simultaneously.",
        "A method addressing the sequence flip is presented in the next section. 7.3 Sequence Flip and Protection Band Sequence flip problems can be solved with and without time synchronization.",
        "We firstly start with a scenario applying time synchronization.",
        "Existing solutions for time synchronization [12, 6] can easily achieve sub-millisecond-level accuracy.",
        "For example, FTSP [12] achieves 16.9µs (microsecond) average error for a two-node single-hop case.",
        "Therefore, we can comfortably assume that the network is synchronized with maximum error of 1000µs.",
        "However, when multiple nodes are located very near to each other along the event propagation direction, even when time synchronization with less than 1ms error is achieved in the network, sequence flip may still occur.",
        "For example, in the sound wave propagation case, if two nodes are less than 0.34 meters apart, the difference between their detection timestamp would be smaller than 1 millisecond.",
        "We find that sequence flip could not only damage system accuracy, but also might cause a fatal error in the MSP algorithm.",
        "Figure 13 illustrates both detrimental results.",
        "In the left side of Figure 13(a), suppose node 1 and node 2 are so close to each other that it takes less than 0.5ms for the localization event to propagate from node 1 to node 2.",
        "Now unfortunately, the node sequence is mistaken to be (2,1).",
        "So node 1 is expected to be located to the right of node 2, such as at the position of the dashed node 1.",
        "According to the elimination rule in sequencebased MSP, the left part of node 1s area is cut off as shown in the right part of Figure 13(a).",
        "This is a potentially fatal error, because node 1 is actually located in the dashed area which has been eliminated by mistake.",
        "During the subsequent eliminations introduced by other events, node 1s area might be cut off completely, thus node 1 could consequently be erased from the map!",
        "Even in cases where node 1 still survives, its area actually does not cover its real location. 22 1 2 12 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Flipped Sequence Fatal Elimination Error EventPropagation 1 1 Fatal Error 1 1 2 12 2 Lower boundary of 1 Upper boundary of 1 Flipped Sequence Safe Elimination EventPropagation 1 1 New lower boundary of 1 1 B (a) (b) B: Protection band Figure 13.",
        "Sequence Flip and Protection Band Another problem is not fatal but lowers the localization accuracy.",
        "If we get the right node sequence (1,2), node 1 has a new upper boundary which can narrow the area of node 1 as in Figure 3.",
        "Due to the sequence flip, node 1 loses this new upper boundary.",
        "In order to address the sequence flip problem, especially to prevent nodes from being erased from the map, we propose a protection band compensation approach.",
        "The basic idea of protection band is to extend the boundary of the location area a little bit so as to make sure that the node will never be erased from the map.",
        "This solution is based on the fact that nodes have a high probability of flipping in the sequence if they are near to each other along the event propagation direction.",
        "If two nodes are apart from each other more than some distance, say, B, they rarely flip unless the nodes are faulty.",
        "The width of a protection band B, is largely determined by the maximum error in system time synchronization and the localization event propagation speed.",
        "Figure 13(b) presents the application of the protection band.",
        "Instead of eliminating the dashed part in Figure 13(a) for node 1, the new lower boundary of node 1 is set by shifting the original lower boundary of node 2 to the left by distance B.",
        "In this case, the location area still covers node 1 and protects it from being erased.",
        "In a practical implementation, supposing that the ultrasound event is used, if the maximum error of system time synchronization is 1ms, two nodes might flip with high probability if the timestamp difference between the two nodes is smaller than or equal to 1ms.",
        "Accordingly, we set the protection band B as 0.34m (the distance sound can propagate within 1 millisecond).",
        "By adding the protection band, we reduce the chances of fatal errors, although at the cost of localization accuracy.",
        "Empirical results obtained from our physical test-bed verified this conclusion.",
        "In the case of using the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, the only change we need to make is to select the protection band according to the maximum delay uncertainty introduced by the MAC operation and the event propagation speed.",
        "To bound MAC delay at the node side, a node can drop its report message if it experiences excessive MAC delay.",
        "This converts the sequence flip problem to the incomplete sequence problem, which can be more easily addressed by the method proposed in Section 7.1. 8 Simulation Evaluation Our evaluation of MSP was conducted on three platforms: (i) an indoor system with 46 MICAz motes using straight-line scan, (ii) an outdoor system with 20 MICAz motes using sound wave propagation, and (iii) an extensive simulation under various kinds of physical settings.",
        "In order to understand the behavior of MSP under numerous settings, we start our evaluation with simulations.",
        "Then, we implemented basic MSP and all the advanced MSP methods for the case where time synchronization is available in the network.",
        "The simulation and implementation details are omitted in this paper due to space constraints, but related documents [25] are provided online at http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼zhong/MSP.",
        "Full implementation and evaluation of system without time synchronization are yet to be completed in the near future.",
        "In simulation, we assume all the node sequences are perfect so as to reveal the performance of MSP achievable in the absence of incomplete node sequences or sequence flips.",
        "In our simulations, all the anchor nodes and target nodes are assumed to be deployed uniformly.",
        "The mean and maximum errors are averaged over 50 runs to obtain high confidence.",
        "For legibility reasons, we do not plot the confidence intervals in this paper.",
        "All the simulations are based on the straight-line scan example.",
        "We implement three scan strategies: • Random Scan: The slope of the scan line is randomly chosen at each time. • Regular Scan: The slope is predetermined to rotate uniformly from 0 degree to 180 degrees.",
        "For example, if the system scans 6 times, then the scan angles would be: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150. • Adaptive Scan: The slope of each scan is determined based on the localization results from previous scans.",
        "We start with basic MSP and then demonstrate the performance improvements one step at a time by adding (i) sequencebased MSP, (ii) iterative MSP, (iii) DBE MSP and (iv) adaptive MSP. 8.1 Performance of Basic MSP The evaluation starts with basic MSP, where we compare the performance of random scan and regular scan under different configurations.",

        "This is because regular scans uniformly eliminate the map from different directions, while random scans would obtain sequences with redundant overlapping information, if two scans choose two similar scanning slopes. 8.2 Improvements of Sequence-Based MSP This section evaluates the benefits of exploiting the order information among target nodes by comparing sequence-based MSP with basic MSP.",
        "In this and the following sections, regular scan is used for straight-line scan event generation.",
        "The purpose of using regular scan is to keep the scan events and the node sequences identical for both sequence-based MSP and basic MSP, so that the only difference between them is the sequence processing procedure.",
        "Impact of the Number of Scans: In this experiment, we compare sequence-based MSP with basic MSP under different number of scans from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.",
        "Figure 15(a) indicates significant performance improvement in sequence-based MSP over basic MSP across all scan settings, especially when the number of scans is large.",
        "For example, when the number of scans is 30, errors in sequence-based MSP are about 20% of that of basic MSP.",
        "We conclude that sequence-based MSP performs extremely well when there are many scan events.",
        "Impact of the Number of Anchors: In this experiment, we use different number of anchors from 3 to 30 in steps of 3.",
        "As seen in Figure 15(b), the mean error and maximum error of sequence-based MSP is much smaller than that of basic MSP.",
        "Especially when there is limited number of anchors in the system, e.g., 3 anchors, the error rate was almost halved by using sequence-based MSP.",
        "This phenomenon has an interesting explanation: the cutting lines created by anchor nodes are exploited by both basic MSP and sequence-based MSP, so as the 24 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Basic MSP VS Iterative MSP Iterative Times Error Max Error of Iterative Seq MSP Mean Error of Iterative Seq MSP Max Error of Basic MSP Mean Error of Basic MSP Figure 16.",

        "Therefore the performance gaps lessens.",
        "Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 15(c) demonstrates the benefits of exploiting order information among target nodes.",
        "Since sequence-based MSP makes use of the information among the target nodes, having more target nodes contributes to the overall system accuracy.",
        "As the number of target nodes increases, the mean error and maximum error of sequence-based MSP decreases.",
        "Clearly the mean error in basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown in Figure 15(c).",
        "Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that exploiting order information among target nodes can improve accuracy significantly, especially when the number of events is large but with few anchors. 8.3 Iterative MSP over Sequence-Based MSP In this experiment, the same node sequences were processed iteratively multiple times.",
        "In Figure 16, the two single marks are results from basic MSP, since basic MSP doesnt perform iterations.",
        "The two curves present the performance of iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP.",
        "Therefore, Figure 16 compares the three methods to one another.",
        "Figure 16 shows that the second iteration can reduce the mean error and maximum error dramatically.",
        "After that, the performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5.",
        "This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first iteration.",
        "Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations. 8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance.",
        "Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution localization errors.",
        "In general, the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left of that of non-DBE MSP, which indicates that DBE MSP has a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error than non-DBE MSP.",
        "We note that because DBE is augmented on top of the best solution so far, the performance improvement is not significant.",
        "When we apply DBE on basic MSP methods, the improvement is much more significant.",
        "We omit these results because of space constraints. 8.5 Improvements of Adaptive MSP This section illustrates the performance of adaptive MSP over non-adaptive MSP.",
        "We note that feedback-based adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only the scanning angles but not the sequence processing.",
        "In this experiment, we evaluated how adaptive MSP can improve the best solution so far.",
        "The default angle granularity (step) for adaptive searching is 5 degrees.",
        "Impact of Area Shape: First, if system settings are regular, the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results.",
        "For a square area (regular), the performance of adaptive MSP and regular scans are very close.",
        "However, if the shape of the area is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate localization events to compensate.",
        "Therefore, adaptive MSP can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown in Figure 18(a).",
        "For example, adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.",
        "Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 18(a) shows that when the node density is low, adaptive MSP brings more benefit than when node density is high.",
        "This phenomenon makes statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when the number of nodes is increased.",
        "Adaptive MSP has an edge 25 Figure 19.",
        "The Mirage Test-bed (Line Scan) Figure 20.",
        "The 20-node Outdoor Experiments (Wave) when layout is not uniform.",
        "Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the statistical performance in terms of mean error.",
        "The rationale is clear, as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle. 8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve localization performance.",
        "In other words, these optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly improve the overall performance.",
        "We note that our simulations were done under assumption that the complete node sequence can be obtained without sequence flips.",
        "In the next section, we present two real-system implementations that reveal and address these practical issues. 9 System Evaluation In this section, we present a system implementation of MSP on two physical test-beds.",
        "The first one is called Mirage, a large indoor test-bed composed of six 4-foot by 8-foot boards, illustrated in Figure 19.",
        "Each board in the system can be used as an individual sub-system, which is powered, controlled and metered separately.",
        "Three Hitachi CP-X1250 projectors, connected through a Matorx Triplehead2go graphics expansion box, are used to create an ultra-wide integrated display on six boards.",
        "Figure 19 shows that a long tilted line is generated by the projectors.",
        "We have implemented all five versions of MSP on the Mirage test-bed, running 46 MICAz motes.",
        "Unless mentioned otherwise, the default setting is 3 anchors and 6 scans at the scanning line speed of 8.6 feet/s.",
        "In all of our graphs, each data point represents the average value of 50 trials.",
        "In the outdoor system, a Dell A525 speaker is used to generate 4.7KHz sound as shown in Figure 20.",
        "We place 20 MICAz motes in the backyard of a house.",
        "Since the location is not completely open, sound waves are reflected, scattered and absorbed by various objects in the vicinity, causing a multi-path effect.",
        "In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.",
        "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
        "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
        "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
        "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",
        "Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.",
        "The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.",
        "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
        "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
        "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
        "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
        "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
        "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",
        "Figure 23(a) shows that a protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s.",
        "Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show clearly that iterative MSP (with adaptation) achieves best performance.",
        "For example, Figures 23(b) shows that when we set the protection band at 0.05 feet, iterative MSP achieves 0.7 feet accuracy, which is 42% more accurate than the basic design.",
        "Similarly, Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show the double-edged effects of protection band on the localization accuracy. 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (3) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 14.6feet/s Flips Node Distance in the Ideal Node Sequence 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (2) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 8.6feet/s Flips 0 5 10 15 20 0 20 40 (1) Flip Distribution for 6 Scans at Line Speed of 4.3feet/s Flips Figure 21.",

                "Previous research mostly applied the Center of Gravity (COG) method [4] [8] [10] which minimizes average error.",
                "If every node is independent of all others, COG is the statistically best solution.",
                "In MSP, however, each node may not be independent.",
                "For example, two neighboring nodes in a certain sequence could have overlapping polygon areas.",

                "If COG is used, both nodes are localized at the same position (Figure 6(a)).",
                "However, the node sequences obtained from two scans indicate that node 1 should be to the left of and above node 2, as shown in Figure 6(b).",

                "The distributions of each node under the ith scan (for the ith node sequence) are estimated in node.vmap[i], which is a data structure for remembering the marginal distribution over scan i.",
                "Then all the vmaps are combined to get a single map and weighted estimation is used to obtain the final location.",
                "For each scan, all the nodes are sorted according to the gap, which is the diameter of the polygon along the direction of the scan, to produce a second, gap-based node sequence.",
                "Then, the estimation starts from the node with the smallest gap.",
                "This is because it is statistically more accurate to assume a uniform distribution of the node with smaller gap.",
                "For each node processed in order from the gap-based node sequence, either if 19 Pred. nodes area Predecessor node exists: conditional distribution based on pred. nodes area Alone: Uniformly Distributed Succ. nodes area Successor node exists: conditional distribution based on succ. nodes area Succ. nodes area Both predecessor and successor nodes exist: conditional distribution based on both of them Pred. nodes area Figure 8.",

                "Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas.",
                "The idea of adaptive MSP is to generate the next localization event to achieve best-effort elimination, which ideally could shrink the location area of individual node as much as possible.",

                "Every node wants the next event to split its area evenly, which would shrink the area fast.",

                "In other words, an optimal scan event cuts an area in the middle, since this cut shrinks the area quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly.",
                "Combining the above two aspects, the weight for each vote is computed according to the following equation (1): Weight(k j i ) = f(Di,△(k j i ,k opt i )) (1) k j i is node is jth supporting parameter for next event generation; Di is diameter of node is location area; △(k j i ,k opt i ) is the distance between k j i and the optimal parameter k opt i for node i, which should be defined to fit the specific application.",

                "The location area of target node 3 is shown in the figure.",
                "The candidate events k1 3,k2 3,k3 3,k4 3,k5 3,k6 3 are evaluated according to their effectiveness compared to the optimal ideal event which is shown as a dotted line with appropriate weights computed according to equation (1).",

                "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
                "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",
                "Example of Wave Propagation Situation • Under the situation of line-of-sight, we allow obstacles to reflect or deflect the wave.",
                "Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.",
                "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
                "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",

                "As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time instance.",
                "For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node sequence.",
                "Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b).",
                "Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).",

                "Figure 1 shows that the node sequences can be obtained much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via ranging methods.",
                "In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]).",
                "For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: • Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9]. • Realistic Deployment, in which (i) node sequences can be partial (incomplete), (ii) elements in sequences could flip (i.e., the order obtained is reversed from reality), and (iii) nodes are not time-synchronized.",

                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
                "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",

                "When node 2 detects the event, node 2 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts (1, 2).",
                "The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a).",
                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",
                "One problem that may occur using the listen-detectassemble-report protocol is multiple partial sequences as shown in Figure 12 (b).",
                "Two separate paths in the network may result in two sequences that could not be further combined.",

                "However, when multiple nodes are located very near to each other along the event propagation direction, even when time synchronization with less than 1ms error is achieved in the network, sequence flip may still occur.",

                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
                "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",

                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",

                "Obviously, it is possible to have some choice and optimization on how events are generated.",
                "For example, in military situations, artillery or rocket-launched mini-ultrasound bombs can be used for event generation at some selected locations.",
                "In adaptive MSP, we carefully generate each new localization event so as to maximize the contribution of the new event to the refinement of localization, based on feedback from previous events.",
                "Figure 9 depicts the basic architecture of adaptive MSP.",
                "Through previous localization events, the whole map has been partitioned into many small location areas.",
                "The idea of adaptive MSP is to generate the next localization event to achieve best-effort elimination, which ideally could shrink the location area of individual node as much as possible.",
                "We use a weighted voting mechanism to evaluate candidate localization events.",
                "Every node wants the next event to split its area evenly, which would shrink the area fast.",
                "Therefore, every node votes for the parameters of the next event (e.g., the scan angle k of the straight-line scan).",
                "Since the area map is maintained centrally, the vote is virtually done and there is no need for the real sensor nodes to participate in it.",
                "After gathering all the voting results, the event parameters with the most votes win the election.",
                "There are two factors that determine the weight of each vote: • The vote for each candidate event is weighted according to the diameter D of the nodes location area.",

                "Candidate Slops for Node 3 at Anchor 1 overall system error is reduced mostly by splitting the larger areas. • The vote for each candidate event is also weighted according to its elimination efficiency for a location area, which is defined as how equally in size (or in diameter) an event can cut an area.",
                "In other words, an optimal scan event cuts an area in the middle, since this cut shrinks the area quickly and thus reduces localization uncertainty quickly.",
                "Combining the above two aspects, the weight for each vote is computed according to the following equation (1): Weight(k j i ) = f(Di,△(k j i ,k opt i )) (1) k j i is node is jth supporting parameter for next event generation; Di is diameter of node is location area; △(k j i ,k opt i ) is the distance between k j i and the optimal parameter k opt i for node i, which should be defined to fit the specific application.",
                "Figure 10 presents an example for node 1s voting for the slopes of the next straight-line scan.",
                "In the system, there are a fixed number of candidate slopes for each scan (e.g., k1,k2,k3,k4...).",
                "The location area of target node 3 is shown in the figure.",
                "The candidate events k1 3,k2 3,k3 3,k4 3,k5 3,k6 3 are evaluated according to their effectiveness compared to the optimal ideal event which is shown as a dotted line with appropriate weights computed according to equation (1).",

                "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
                "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",
                "Example of Wave Propagation Situation • Under the situation of line-of-sight, we allow obstacles to reflect or deflect the wave.",
                "Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.",
                "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
                "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",

                "When node 2 detects the event, node 2 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts (1, 2).",
                "The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a).",
                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",

                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",

                "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",

                "As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time instance.",
                "For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node sequence.",
                "Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b).",
                "Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).",
                "Finally, a distributionbased estimation method estimates the exact location of each sensor node, as shown in Figure 1(d).",
                "Figure 1 shows that the node sequences can be obtained much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via ranging methods.",
                "In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]).",
                "For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: • Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9]. • Realistic Deployment, in which (i) node sequences can be partial (incomplete), (ii) elements in sequences could flip (i.e., the order obtained is reversed from reality), and (iii) nodes are not time-synchronized.",

                "Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2.",

                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",

                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",

                "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
                "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",
                "Example of Wave Propagation Situation • Under the situation of line-of-sight, we allow obstacles to reflect or deflect the wave.",
                "Reflection and deflection are not problems because each node reacts only to the first detected event.",
                "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",

                "When node 2 detects the event, node 2 adds itself into the sequence and broadcasts (1, 2).",
                "The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a).",
                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "After that, the performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5.",
                "This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first iteration.",
                "Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations. 8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance.",

                "The rationale is clear, as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle. 8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve localization performance.",
                "In other words, these optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly improve the overall performance.",

                "In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.",
                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
                "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",
                "Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.",
                "The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.",
                "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",

                "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
                "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",

                "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
                "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",

                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",

                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",

                "The sequence propagates in the same direction with the scan as shown in Figure 12 (a).",
                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "We note that feedback-based adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only the scanning angles but not the sequence processing.",

                "In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.",
                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
                "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",
                "Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.",
                "The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.",
                "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",

                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",

                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",

                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",

                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",

                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a <br>listen-detect-assemble-report protocol</br>, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",

                "As the number of target nodes increases, the mean error and maximum error of sequence-based MSP decreases.",
                "Clearly the mean error in basic MSP is not affected by the number of target nodes, as shown in Figure 15(c).",
                "Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that exploiting order information among target nodes can improve accuracy significantly, especially when the number of events is large but with few anchors. 8.3 Iterative MSP over Sequence-Based MSP In this experiment, the same node sequences were processed iteratively multiple times.",
                "In Figure 16, the two single marks are results from basic MSP, since basic MSP doesnt perform iterations.",
                "The two curves present the performance of iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP.",

                "Figure 16 shows that the second iteration can reduce the mean error and maximum error dramatically.",
                "After that, the performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5.",
                "This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first iteration.",
                "Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations. 8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance.",
                "Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution localization errors.",
                "In general, the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left of that of non-DBE MSP, which indicates that DBE MSP has a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error than non-DBE MSP.",

                "When we apply DBE on basic MSP methods, the improvement is much more significant.",
                "We omit these results because of space constraints. 8.5 Improvements of Adaptive MSP This section illustrates the performance of adaptive MSP over non-adaptive MSP.",
                "We note that feedback-based adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only the scanning angles but not the sequence processing.",
                "In this experiment, we evaluated how adaptive MSP can improve the best solution so far.",

                "For a square area (regular), the performance of adaptive MSP and regular scans are very close.",
                "However, if the shape of the area is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate localization events to compensate.",
                "Therefore, adaptive MSP can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown in Figure 18(a).",
                "For example, adaptive MSP improves localization accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.",
                "Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 18(a) shows that when the node density is low, adaptive MSP brings more benefit than when node density is high.",
                "This phenomenon makes statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when the number of nodes is increased.",

                "Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the statistical performance in terms of mean error.",
                "The rationale is clear, as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle. 8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve localization performance.",
                "In other words, these optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly improve the overall performance.",
                "We note that our simulations were done under assumption that the complete node sequence can be obtained without sequence flips.",
                "In the next section, we present two real-system implementations that reveal and address these practical issues. 9 System Evaluation In this section, we present a system implementation of MSP on two physical test-beds.",
                "The first one is called Mirage, a large indoor test-bed composed of six 4-foot by 8-foot boards, illustrated in Figure 19.",
                "Each board in the system can be used as an individual sub-system, which is powered, controlled and metered separately.",

                "We have implemented all five versions of MSP on the Mirage test-bed, running 46 MICAz motes.",
                "Unless mentioned otherwise, the default setting is 3 anchors and 6 scans at the scanning line speed of 8.6 feet/s.",
                "In all of our graphs, each data point represents the average value of 50 trials.",

                "We place 20 MICAz motes in the backyard of a house.",
                "Since the location is not completely open, sound waves are reflected, scattered and absorbed by various objects in the vicinity, causing a multi-path effect.",
                "In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.",
                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
                "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",
                "Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.",
                "The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.",
                "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",
                "Figure 23(a) shows that a protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s.",

                "We emphasize that MSP adopts an asymmetric design in which sensor nodes need only to detect and report the events.",
                "They are blissfully oblivious to the processing methods proposed in previous sections.",
                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the node sequence processing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",

                "Those reflected or deflected waves come later than the line-of-sight waves.",
                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",

                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive <br>localization</br> events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the <br>localization</br> event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",

                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of <br>localization</br> events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect <br>localization</br> events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",

                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup <br>localization</br> approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the <br>localization</br>.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more <br>localization</br> events need to be launched. 7.2 <br>localization</br> without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the <br>localization</br> event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",

                "Summary: From the above experiments, we can conclude that exploiting order information among target nodes can improve accuracy significantly, especially when the number of events is large but with few anchors. 8.3 Iterative MSP over Sequence-Based MSP In this experiment, the same node sequences were processed iteratively multiple times.",
                "In Figure 16, the two single marks are results from basic MSP, since basic MSP doesnt perform iterations.",
                "The two curves present the performance of iterative MSP under different numbers of iterations c. We note that when only a single iteration is used, this method degrades to sequence-based MSP.",

                "Figure 16 shows that the second iteration can reduce the mean error and maximum error dramatically.",
                "After that, the performance gain gradually reduces, especially when c > 5.",
                "This is because the second iteration allows earlier scans to exploit the new boundaries created by later scans in the first iteration.",
                "Such exploitation decays quickly over iterations. 8.4 DBE MSP over Iterative MSP Figure 17, in which we augment iterative MSP with distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP), shows that DBE MSP could bring about statistically better performance.",
                "Figure 17 presents cumulative distribution <br>localization</br> errors.",
                "In general, the two curves of the DBE MSP lay slightly to the left of that of non-DBE MSP, which indicates that DBE MSP has a smaller statistical mean error and averaged maximum error than non-DBE MSP.",

                "When we apply DBE on basic MSP methods, the improvement is much more significant.",
                "We omit these results because of space constraints. 8.5 Improvements of Adaptive MSP This section illustrates the performance of adaptive MSP over non-adaptive MSP.",
                "We note that feedback-based adaptation can be applied to all MSP methods, since it affects only the scanning angles but not the sequence processing.",
                "In this experiment, we evaluated how adaptive MSP can improve the best solution so far.",
                "The default angle granularity (step) for adaptive searching is 5 degrees.",
                "Impact of Area Shape: First, if system settings are regular, the adaptive method hardly contributes to the results.",
                "For a square area (regular), the performance of adaptive MSP and regular scans are very close.",
                "However, if the shape of the area is not regular, adaptive MSP helps to choose the appropriate <br>localization</br> events to compensate.",
                "Therefore, adaptive MSP can achieve a better mean error and maximum error as shown in Figure 18(a).",
                "For example, adaptive MSP improves <br>localization</br> accuracy by 30% when the number of target nodes is 10.",
                "Impact of the Target Node Density: Figure 18(a) shows that when the node density is low, adaptive MSP brings more benefit than when node density is high.",
                "This phenomenon makes statistical sense, because the law of large numbers tells us that node placement approaches a truly uniform distribution when the number of nodes is increased.",

                "Impact of Candidate Angle Density: Figure 18(b) shows that the smaller the candidate scan angle step, the better the statistical performance in terms of mean error.",
                "The rationale is clear, as wider candidate scan angles provide adaptive MSP more opportunity to choose the one approaching the optimal angle. 8.6 Simulation Summary Starting from basic MSP, we have demonstrated step-bystep how four optimizations can be applied on top of each other to improve <br>localization</br> performance.",
                "In other words, these optimizations are compatible with each other and can jointly improve the overall performance.",
                "We note that our simulations were done under assumption that the complete node sequence can be obtained without sequence flips.",
                "In the next section, we present two real-system implementations that reveal and address these practical issues. 9 System Evaluation In this section, we present a system implementation of MSP on two physical test-beds.",
                "The first one is called Mirage, a large indoor test-bed composed of six 4-foot by 8-foot boards, illustrated in Figure 19.",

                "Figure 19 shows that a long tilted line is generated by the projectors.",
                "We have implemented all five versions of MSP on the Mirage test-bed, running 46 MICAz motes.",
                "Unless mentioned otherwise, the default setting is 3 anchors and 6 scans at the scanning line speed of 8.6 feet/s.",
                "In all of our graphs, each data point represents the average value of 50 trials.",

                "We place 20 MICAz motes in the backyard of a house.",
                "Since the location is not completely open, sound waves are reflected, scattered and absorbed by various objects in the vicinity, causing a multi-path effect.",
                "In the system evaluation, simple time synchronization mechanisms are applied on each node. 9.1 Indoor System Evaluation During indoor experiments, we encountered several realworld problems that are not revealed in the simulation.",
                "First, sequences obtained were partial due to misdetection and message losses.",
                "Second, elements in the sequences could flip due to detection delay, uncertainty in media access, or error in time synchronization.",
                "We show that these issues can be addressed by using the protection band method described in Section 7.3. 9.1.1 On Scanning Speed and Protection Band In this experiment, we studied the impact of the scanning speed and the length of protection band on the performance of the system.",
                "In general, with increasing scanning speed, nodes have less time to respond to the event and the time gap between two adjacent nodes shrinks, leading to an increasing number of partial sequences and sequence flips.",
                "Figure 21 shows the node flip situations for six scans with distinct angles under different scan speeds.",
                "The x-axis shows the distance between the flipped nodes in the correct node sequence. y-axis shows the total number of flips in the six scans.",
                "This figure tells us that faster scan brings in not only increasing number of flips, but also longer-distance flips that require wider protection band to prevent from fatal errors.",
                "Figure 22(a) shows the effectiveness of the protection band in terms of reducing the number of unlocalized nodes.",
                "When we use a moderate scan speed (4.3feet/s), the chance of flipping is rare, therefore we can achieve 0.45 feet mean accuracy (Figure 22(b)) with 1.6 feet maximum error (Figure 22(c)).",
                "With increasing speeds, the protection band needs to be set to a larger value to deal with flipping.",
                "Interesting phenomena can be observed in Figures 22: on one hand, the protection band can sharply reduce the number of unlocalized nodes; on the other hand, protection bands enlarge the area in which a target would potentially reside, introducing more uncertainty.",
                "Thus there is a concave curve for both mean and maximum error when the scan speed is at 8.6 feet/s. 9.1.2 On MSP Methods and Protection Band In this experiment, we show the improvements resulting from three different methods.",
                "Figure 23(a) shows that a protection band of 0.35 feet is sufficient for the scan speed of 8.57feet/s.",
                "Figures 23(b) and 23(c) show clearly that iterative MSP (with adaptation) achieves best performance.",
                "For example, Figures 23(b) shows that when we set the protection band at 0.05 feet, iterative MSP achieves 0.7 feet accuracy, which is 42% more accurate than the basic design.",

                "We address several interesting issues, such as incomplete (partial) node sequences and sequence flip, found in the Mirage test-bed we built.",
                "We have evaluated the MSP system through theoretical analysis, extensive simulation as well as two physical systems (an indoor version with 46 MICAz motes and an outdoor version with 20 MICAz motes).",
                "This evaluation demonstrates that MSP can achieve an accuracy within one foot, requiring neither additional costly hardware on sensor nodes nor precise event distribution.",
                "It also provides a nice tradeoff between physical cost (anchors) and soft cost (events), while maintaining localization accuracy.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer Communications Networks]: Distributed Systems General Terms Algorithms, Measurement, Design, Performance, Experimentation 1 Introduction Although Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have shown promising prospects in various applications [5], researchers still face several challenges for massive deployment of such networks.",
                "One of these is to identify the location of individual sensor nodes in outdoor environments.",
                "Because of unpredictable flow dynamics in airborne scenarios, it is not currently feasible to localize sensor nodes during massive UVA-based deployment.",
                "On the other hand, geometric information is indispensable in these networks, since users need to know where events of interest occur (e.g., the location of intruders or of a bomb explosion).",
                "Previous research on node localization falls into two categories: range-based approaches and range-free approaches.",
                "Range-based approaches [13, 17, 19, 24] compute per-node location information iteratively or recursively based on measured distances among target nodes and a few anchors which precisely know their locations.",
                "These approaches generally require costly hardware (e.g., GPS) and have limited effective range due to energy constraints (e.g., ultrasound-based TDOA [3, 17]).",
                "Although range-based solutions can be suitably used in small-scale indoor environments, they are considered less cost-effective for large-scale deployments.",
                "On the other hand, range-free approaches [4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15] do not require accurate distance measurements, but localize the node based on network connectivity (proximity) information.",
                "Unfortunately, since wireless connectivity is highly influenced by the environment and hardware calibration, existing solutions fail to deliver encouraging empirical results, or require substantial survey [2] and calibration [24] on a case-by-case basis.",
                "Realizing the impracticality of existing solutions for the large-scale outdoor environment, researchers have recently proposed solutions (e.g., Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18]) for sensor node localization using the spatiotemporal correlation of controlled events (i.e., inferring nodes locations based on the detection time of controlled events).",
                "These solutions demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at sensor nodes.",
                "These benefits, however, come along with an implicit assumption that the controlled events can be precisely distributed to a specified location at a specified time.",
                "We argue that precise event distribution is difficult to achieve, especially at large scale when terrain is uneven, the event distribution device is not well calibrated and its position is difficult to maintain (e.g., the helicopter-mounted scenario in [20]).",
                "To address these limitations in current approaches, in this paper we present a multi-sequence positioning (MSP) method 15 for large-scale stationary sensor node localization, in deployments where an event source has line-of-sight to all sensors.",
                "The novel idea behind MSP is to estimate each sensor nodes two-dimensional location by processing multiple easy-to-get one-dimensional node sequences (e.g., event detection order) obtained through loosely-guided event distribution.",
                "This design offers several benefits.",
                "First, compared to a range-based approach, MSP does not require additional costly hardware.",
                "It works using sensors typically used by sensor network applications, such as light and acoustic sensors, both of which we specifically consider in this work.",
                "Second, compared to a range-free approach, MSP needs only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two), so high accuracy can be achieved economically by introducing more events instead of more anchors.",
                "And third, compared to Spotlight, MSP does not require precise and sophisticated event distribution, an advantage that significantly simplifies the system design and reduces calibration cost.",
                "This paper offers the following additional intellectual contributions: • We are the first to localize sensor nodes using the concept of node sequence, an ordered list of sensor nodes, sorted by the detection time of a disseminated event.",
                "We demonstrate that making full use of the information embedded in one-dimensional node sequences can significantly improve localization accuracy.",
                "Interestingly, we discover that repeated reprocessing of one-dimensional node sequences can further increase localization accuracy. • We propose a distribution-based location estimation strategy that obtains the final location of sensor nodes using the marginal probability of joint distribution among adjacent nodes within the sequence.",
                "This new algorithm outperforms the widely adopted Centroid estimation [4, 8]. • To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the localization accuracy of nodes by adaptive events.",
                "The generation of later events is guided by localization results from previous events. • We evaluate line-based MSP on our new Mirage test-bed, and wave-based MSP in outdoor environments.",
                "Through system implementation, we discover and address several interesting issues such as partial sequence and sequence flips.",
                "To reveal MSP performance at scale, we provide analytic results as well as a complete simulation study.",

                "Section 3 presents an overview of the MSP localization system.",
                "In sections 4 and 5, basic MSP and four advanced processing methods are introduced.",

                "Section 7 discusses several implementation issues.",

                "Section 10 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work Many methods have been proposed to localize wireless sensor devices in the open air.",
                "Most of these can be classified into two categories: range-based and range-free localization.",
                "Range-based localization systems, such as GPS [23], Cricket [17], AHLoS [19], AOA [16], Robust Quadrilaterals [13] and Sweeps [7], are based on fine-grained point-topoint distance estimation or angle estimation to identify pernode location.",
                "Constraints on the cost, energy and hardware footprint of each sensor node make these range-based methods undesirable for massive outdoor deployment.",
                "In addition, ranging signals generated by sensor nodes have a very limited effective range because of energy and form factor concerns.",
                "For example, ultrasound signals usually effectively propagate 20-30 feet using an on-board transmitter [17].",
                "Consequently, these range-based solutions require an undesirably high deployment density.",
                "Although the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) related [2, 24] methods were once considered an ideal low-cost solution, the irregularity of radio propagation [26] seriously limits the accuracy of such systems.",
                "The recently proposed RIPS localization system [11] superimposes two RF waves together, creating a low-frequency envelope that can be accurately measured.",
                "This ranging technique performs very well as long as antennas are well oriented and environmental factors such as multi-path effects and background noise are sufficiently addressed.",
                "Range-free methods dont need to estimate or measure accurate distances or angles.",
                "Instead, anchors or controlled-event distributions are used for node localization.",
                "Range-free methods can be generally classified into two types: anchor-based and anchor-free solutions. • For anchor-based solutions such as Centroid [4], APIT [8], SeRLoc [10], Gradient [13] , and APS [15], the main idea is that the location of each node is estimated based on the known locations of the anchor nodes.",
                "Different anchor combinations narrow the areas in which the target nodes can possibly be located.",
                "Anchor-based solutions normally require a high density of anchor nodes so as to achieve good accuracy.",
                "In practice, it is desirable to have as few anchor nodes as possible so as to lower the system cost. • Anchor-free solutions require no anchor nodes.",
                "Instead, external event generators and data processing platforms are used.",
                "The main idea is to correlate the event detection time at a sensor node with the known space-time relationship of controlled events at the generator so that detection time-stamps can be mapped into the locations of sensors.",
                "Spotlight [20] and Lighthouse [18] work in this fashion.",
                "In Spotlight [20], the event distribution needs to be precise in both time and space.",
                "Precise event distribution is difficult to achieve without careful calibration, especially when the event-generating devices require certain mechanical maneuvers (e.g., the telescope mount used in Spotlight).",
                "All these increase system cost and reduce localization speed.",
                "StarDust [21], which works much faster, uses label relaxation algorithms to match light spots reflected by corner-cube retro-reflectors (CCR) with sensor nodes using various constraints.",
                "Label relaxation algorithms converge only when a sufficient number of robust constraints are obtained.",
                "Due to the environmental impact on RF connectivity constraints, however, StarDust is less accurate than Spotlight.",
                "In this paper, we propose a balanced solution that avoids the limitations of both anchor-based and anchor-free solutions.",

                "MSP uses only a small number of anchors (theoretically, as few as two).",
                "Unlike anchor-free solutions, MSP doesnt need to maintain rigid time-space relationships while distributing events, which makes system design simpler, more flexible and more robust to calibration errors. 3 System Overview MSP works by extracting relative location information from multiple simple one-dimensional orderings of nodes.",
                "Figure 1(a) shows a layout of a sensor network with anchor nodes and target nodes.",
                "Target nodes are defined as the nodes to be localized.",
                "Briefly, the MSP system works as follows.",
                "First, events are generated one at a time in the network area (e.g., ultrasound propagations from different locations, laser scans with diverse angles).",
                "As each event propagates, as shown in Figure 1(a), each node detects it at some particular time instance.",
                "For a single event, we call the ordering of nodes, which is based on the sequential detection of the event, a node sequence.",
                "Each node sequence includes both the targets and the anchors as shown in Figure 1(b).",
                "Second, a multi-sequence processing algorithm helps to narrow the possible location of each node to a small area (Figure 1(c)).",
                "Finally, a distributionbased estimation method estimates the exact location of each sensor node, as shown in Figure 1(d).",
                "Figure 1 shows that the node sequences can be obtained much more economically than accurate pair-wise distance measurements between target nodes and anchor nodes via ranging methods.",
                "In addition, this system does not require a rigid time-space relationship for the localization events, which is critical but hard to achieve in controlled event distribution scenarios (e.g., Spotlight [20]).",
                "For the sake of clarity in presentation, we present our system in two cases: • Ideal Case, in which all the node sequences obtained from the network are complete and correct, and nodes are time-synchronized [12, 9]. • Realistic Deployment, in which (i) node sequences can be partial (incomplete), (ii) elements in sequences could flip (i.e., the order obtained is reversed from reality), and (iii) nodes are not time-synchronized.",
                "To introduce the MSP algorithm, we first consider a simple straight-line scan scenario.",
                "Then, we describe how to implement straight-line scans as well as other event types, such as sound wave propagation. 1 A 2 3 4 5 B C 6 7 8 9 Straight-line Scan 1 Straight-lineScan2 8 1 5 A 6 C 4 3 7 2 B 9 3 1 C 5 9 2 A 4 6 B 7 8 Target node Anchor node Figure 2.",
                "Obtaining Multiple Node Sequences 4 Basic MSP Let us consider a sensor network with N target nodes and M anchor nodes randomly deployed in an area of size S. The top-level idea for basic MSP is to split the whole sensor network area into small pieces by processing node sequences.",
                "Because the exact locations of all the anchors in a node sequence are known, all the nodes in this sequence can be divided into O(M +1) parts in the area.",
                "In Figure 2, we use numbered circles to denote target nodes and numbered hexagons to denote anchor nodes.",
                "Basic MSP uses two straight lines to scan the area from different directions, treating each scan as an event.",
                "All the nodes react to the event sequentially generating two node sequences.",
                "For vertical scan 1, the node sequence is (8,1,5,A,6,C,4,3,7,2,B,9), as shown outside the right boundary of the area in Figure 2; for horizontal scan 2, the node sequence is (3,1,C,5,9,2,A,4,6,B,7,8), as shown under the bottom boundary of the area in Figure 2.",
                "Since the locations of the anchor nodes are available, the anchor nodes in the two node sequences actually split the area vertically and horizontally into 16 parts, as shown in Figure 2.",
                "To extend this process, suppose we have M anchor nodes and perform d scans from different angles, obtaining d node sequences and dividing the area into many small parts.",
                "Obviously, the number of parts is a function of the number of anchors M, the number of scans d, the anchors location as well as the slop k for each scan line.",
                "According to the pie-cutting theorem [22], the area can be divided into O(M2d2) parts.",
                "When M and d are appropriately large, the polygon for each target node may become sufficiently small so that accurate estimation can be achieved.",
                "We emphasize that accuracy is affected not only by the number of anchors M, but also by the number of events d. In other words, MSP provides a tradeoff between the physical cost of anchors and the soft cost of events.",
                "Algorithm 1 depicts the computing architecture of basic MSP.",
                "Each node sequence is processed within line 1 to 8.",
                "For each node, GetBoundaries() in line 5 searches for the predecessor and successor anchors in the sequence so as to determine the boundaries of this node.",
                "Then in line 6 UpdateMap() shrinks the location area of this node according to the newly obtained boundaries.",
                "After processing all sequences, Centroid Estimation (line 11) set the center of gravity of the final polygon as the estimated location of the target node.",
                "Basic MSP only makes use of the order information between a target node and the anchor nodes in each sequence.",

                "The objective of all these improvements is to make full use of the information embedded in the node sequences.",
                "The results we have obtained empirically indicate that the implementation of the first two methods can dramatically reduce the localization error, and that the third and fourth methods are helpful for some system deployments. 5.1 Sequence-Based MSP As shown in Figure 2, each scan line and M anchors, splits the whole area into M + 1 parts.",
                "Each target node falls into one polygon shaped by scan lines.",
                "We noted that in basic MSP, only the anchors are used to narrow down the polygon of each target node, but actually there is more information in the node sequence that we can made use of.",
                "Lets first look at a simple example shown in Figure 3.",
                "The previous scans narrow the locations of target node 1 and node 2 into two dashed rectangles shown in the left part of Figure 3.",
                "Then a new scan generates a new sequence (1, 2).",

                "Thus, we can further narrow the location area of node 2 by eliminating the shaded part of node 2s rectangle.",

                "In this section, we analyze the computational cost on the <br>node sequence process</br>ing side, where resources are plentiful.",
                "According to Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of Basic MSP is O(d · N · S), and the storage space required is O(N · S), where d is the number of events, N is the number of target nodes, and S is the area size.",
                "According to Algorithm 2, the computational complexity of both sequence-based MSP and iterative MSP is O(c·d ·N ·S), where c is the number of iterations and c = 1 for sequencebased MSP, and the storage space required is O(N ·S).",
                "Both the computational complexity and storage space are equal within a constant factor to those of basic MSP.",
                "The computational complexity of the distribution-based estimation (DBE MSP) is greater.",
                "The major overhead comes from the computation of joint distributions when both predecessor and successor nodes exit.",
                "In order to compute the marginal probability, MSP needs to enumerate the locations of the predecessor node and the successor node.",
                "For example, if node A has predecessor node B and successor node C, then the marginal probability PA(x,y) of node As being at location (x,y) is: PA(x,y) = ∑ i ∑ j ∑ m ∑ n 1 NB,A,C ·PB(i, j)·PC(m,n) (3) NB,A,C is the number of valid locations for A satisfying the sequence (B, A, C) when B is at (i, j) and C is at (m,n); PB(i, j) is the available probability of node Bs being located at (i, j); PC(m,n) is the available probability of node Cs being located at (m,n).",
                "A naive algorithm to compute equation (3) has complexity O(d · N · S3).",
                "However, since the marginal probability indeed comes from only one dimension along the scanning direction (e.g., a line), the complexity can be reduced to O(d · N · S1.5) after algorithm optimization.",
                "In addition, the final location areas for every node are much smaller than the original field S; therefore, in practice, DBE MSP can be computed much faster than O(d ·N ·S1.5). 6 Wave Propagation Example So far, the description of MSP has been solely in the context of straight-line scan.",
                "However, we note that MSP is conceptually independent of how the event is propagated as long as node sequences can be obtained.",
                "Clearly, we can also support wave-propagation-based events (e.g., ultrasound propagation, air blast propagation), which are polar coordinate equivalences of the line scans in the Cartesian coordinate system.",
                "This section illustrates the effects of MSPs implementation in the wave propagation-based situation.",
                "For easy modelling, we have made the following assumptions: • The wave propagates uniformly in all directions, therefore the propagation has a circle frontier surface.",
                "Since MSP does not rely on an accurate space-time relationship, a certain distortion in wave propagation is tolerable.",
                "If any directional wave is used, the propagation frontier surface can be modified accordingly. 1 3 5 9 Target node Anchor node Previous Event location A 2 Center of Gravity 4 8 7 B 6 C A line of preferred locations for next event Figure 11.",

                "The only thing the system needs to maintain is an appropriate time interval between two successive localization events. • We assume that background noise exists, and therefore we run a band-pass filter to listen to a particular wave frequency.",
                "This reduces the chances of false detection.",
                "The parameter that affects the localization event generation here is the source location of the event.",
                "The different distances between each node and the event source determine the rank of each node in the node sequence.",
                "Using the node sequences, the MSP algorithm divides the whole area into many non-rectangular areas as shown in Figure 11.",
                "In this figure, the stars represent two previous event sources.",
                "The previous two propagations split the whole map into many areas by those dashed circles that pass one of the anchors.",
                "Each node is located in one of the small areas.",
                "Since sequence-based MSP, iterative MSP and DBE MSP make no assumptions about the type of localization events and the shape of the area, all three optimization algorithms can be applied for the wave propagation scenario.",
                "However, adaptive MSP needs more explanation.",
                "Figure 11 illustrates an example of nodes voting for next event source locations.",
                "Unlike the straight-line scan, the critical parameter now is the location of the event source, because the distance between each node and the event source determines the rank of the node in the sequence.",
                "In Figure 11, if the next event breaks out along/near the solid thick gray line, which perpendicularly bisects the solid dark line between anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area (the gray area), the wave would reach anchor C and the center of gravity of node 9s area at roughly the same time, which would relatively equally divide node 9s area.",
                "Therefore, node 9 prefers to vote for the positions around the thick gray line. 7 Practical Deployment Issues For the sake of presentation, until now we have described MSP in an ideal case where a complete node sequence can be obtained with accurate time synchronization.",
                "In this section we describe how to make MSP work well under more realistic conditions. 21 7.1 Incomplete Node Sequence For diverse reasons, such as sensor malfunction or natural obstacles, the nodes in the network could fail to detect localization events.",
                "In such cases, the node sequence will not be complete.",
                "This problem has two versions: • Anchor nodes are missing in the node sequence If some anchor nodes fail to respond to the localization events, then the system has fewer anchors.",
                "In this case, the solution is to generate more events to compensate for the loss of anchors so as to achieve the desired accuracy requirements. • Target nodes are missing in the node sequence There are two consequences when target nodes are missing.",
                "First, if these nodes are still be useful to sensing applications, they need to use other backup localization approaches (e.g., Centroid) to localize themselves with help from their neighbors who have already learned their own locations from MSP.",
                "Secondly, since in advanced MSP each node in the sequence may contribute to the overall system accuracy, dropping of target nodes from sequences could also reduce the accuracy of the localization.",
                "Thus, proper compensation procedures such as adding more localization events need to be launched. 7.2 Localization without Time Synchronization In a sensor network without time synchronization support, nodes cannot be ordered into a sequence using timestamps.",
                "For such cases, we propose a listen-detect-assemble-report protocol, which is able to function independently without time synchronization. listen-detect-assemble-report requires that every node listens to the channel for the node sequence transmitted from its neighbors.",
                "Then, when the node detects the localization event, it assembles itself into the newest node sequence it has heard and reports the updated sequence to other nodes.",
                "Figure 12 (a) illustrates an example for the listen-detect-assemble-report protocol.",
                "For simplicity, in this figure we did not differentiate the target nodes from anchor nodes.",

                "Finally, node 6 obtains a complete sequence (1,2,3,5,7,4,6).",
                "In the case of ultrasound propagation, because the event propagation speed is much slower than that of radio, the listendetect-assemble-report protocol can work well in a situation where the node density is not very high.",
                "For instance, if the distance between two nodes along one direction is 10 meters, the 340m/s sound needs 29.4ms to propagate from one node to the other.",
                "While normally the communication data rate is 250Kbps in the WSN (e.g., CC2420 [1]), it takes only about 2 ∼ 3 ms to transmit an assembled packet for one hop.",
