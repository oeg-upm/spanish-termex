Juda Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University, Harvard Business School ajuda@hbs.edu David C. Parkes Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harvard University parkes@eecs.harvard.edu ABSTRACT Bidders on eBay have no dominant bidding strategy when faced with multiple auctions each offering an item of interest. As seen through an analysis of 1,956 auctions on eBay for a Dell E193FP LCD monitor, some bidders win auctions at prices higher than those of other available auctions, while others never win an auction despite placing bids in losing efforts that are greater than the closing prices of other available auctions. These misqueues in strategic behavior hamper the efficiency of the system, and in so doing limit the revenue potential for sellers. This paper proposes a novel options-based extension to eBays proxy-bidding system that resolves this strategic issue for buyers in commoditized markets. An empirical analysis of eBay provides a basis for computer simulations that investigate the market effects of the options-based scheme, and demonstrates that the options-based scheme provides greater efficiency than eBay, while also increasing seller revenue.

INTRODUCTION Electronic markets represent an application of information systems that has generated significant new trading opportunities while allowing for the dynamic pricing of goods. In addition to marketplaces such as eBay, electronic marketplaces are increasingly used for business-to-consumer auctions (e.g. to sell surplus inventory [19]). Many authors have written about a future in which commerce is mediated by online, automated trading agents [10, 25, 1]. There is still little evidence of automated trading in e-markets, though. We believe that one leading place of resistance is in the lack of provably optimal bidding strategies for any but the simplest of market designs. Without this, we do not expect individual consumers, or firms, to be confident in placing their business in the hands of an automated agent. One of the most common examples today of an electronic marketplace is eBay, where the gross merchandise volume (i.e., the sum of all successfully closed listings) during 2005 was $44B. Among items listed on eBay, many are essentially identical. This is especially true in the Consumer Electronics category [9], which accounted for roughly $3.5B of eBays gross merchandise volume in 2005. This presence of essentially identical items can expose bidders, and sellers, to risks because of the sequential auction problem. For example, Alice may want an LCD monitor, and could potentially bid in either a 1 oclock or 3 oclock eBay auction. While Alice would prefer to participate in whichever auction will have the lower winning price, she cannot determine beforehand which auction that may be, and could end up winning the wrong auction. This is a problem of multiple copies. Another problem bidders may face is the exposure problem. As investigated by Bykowsky et al. [6], exposure problems exist when buyers desire a bundle of goods but may only participate in single-item auctions.1 For example, if Alice values a video game console by itself for $200, a video game by itself for $30, and both a console and game for $250, Alice must determine how much of the $20 of synergy value she might include in her bid for the console alone. Both problems arise in eBay as a result of sequential auctions of single items coupled with patient bidders with substitutes or complementary valuations. Why might the sequential auction problem be bad? Complex games may lead to bidders employing costly strategies and making mistakes. Potential bidders who do not wish to bear such costs may choose not to participate in the 1 The exposure problem has been primarily investigated by Bykowsky et al. in the context of simultaneous single-item auctions. The problem is also a familiar one of online decision making. 180 market, inhibiting seller revenue opportunities. Additionally, among those bidders who do choose to participate, the mistakes made may lead to inefficient allocations, further limiting revenue opportunities. We are interested in creating modifications to eBay-style markets that simplify the bidder problem, leading to simple equilibrium strategies, and preferably better efficiency and revenue properties. 1.1 Options + Proxies: A Proposed Solution Retail stores have developed policies to assist their customers in addressing sequential purchasing problems. Return policies alleviate the exposure problem by allowing customers to return goods at the purchase price. Price matching alleviates the multiple copies problem by allowing buyers to receive from sellers after purchase the difference between the price paid for a good and a lower price found elsewhere for the same good [7, 15, 18]. Furthermore, price matching can reduce the impact of exactly when a seller brings an item to market, as the price will in part be set by others selling the same item. These two retail policies provide the basis for the scheme proposed in this paper.2 We extend the proxy bidding technology currently employed by eBay. Our super-proxy extension will take advantage of a new, real options-based, market infrastructure that enables simple, yet optimal, bidding strategies. The extensions are computationally simple, handle temporal issues, and retain seller autonomy in deciding when to enter the market and conduct individual auctions. A seller sells an option for a good, which will ultimately lead to either a sale of the good or the return of the option. Buyers interact through a proxy agent, defining a value on all possible bundles of goods in which they have interest together with the latest time period in which they are willing to wait to receive the good(s). The proxy agents use this information to determine how much to bid for options, and follow a dominant bidding strategy across all relevant auctions. A proxy agent exercises options held when the buyers patience has expired, choosing options that maximize a buyers payoff given the reported valuation. All other options are returned to the market and not exercised. The options-based protocol makes truthful and immediate revelation to a proxy a dominant strategy for buyers, whatever the future auction dynamics. We conduct an empirical analysis of eBay, collecting data on over four months of bids for Dell LCD screens (model E193FP) starting in the Summer of 2005. LCD screens are a high-ticket item, for which we demonstrate evidence of the sequential bidding problem. We first infer a conservative model for the arrival time, departure time and value of bidders on eBay for LCD screens during this period. This model is used to simulate the performance of the optionsbased infrastructure, in order to make direct comparisons to the actual performance of eBay in this market. We also extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to estimate an upper bound on the distribution of value of eBay bidders, taking into account the sequential auction problem when making the adjustments. Using this estimate, one can approximate how much greater a bidders true value is 2 Prior work has shown price matching as a potential mechanism for colluding firms to set monopoly prices. However, in our context, auction prices will be matched, which are not explicitly set by sellers but rather by buyers bids. from the maximum bid they were observed to have placed on eBay. Based on this approximation, revenue generated in a simulation of the options-based scheme exceeds revenue on eBay for the comparable population and sequence of auctions by 14.8%, while the options-based scheme demonstrates itself as being 7.5% more efficient. 1.2 Related Work A number of authors [27, 13, 28, 29] have analyzed the multiple copies problem, often times in the context of categorizing or modeling sniping behavior for reasons other than those first brought forward by Ockenfels and Roth [20]. These papers perform equilibrium analysis in simpler settings, assuming bidders can participate in at most two auctions. Peters & Severinov [21] extend these models to allow buyers to consider an arbitrary number of auctions, and characterize a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. However, their model does not allow auctions to close at distinct times and does not consider the arrival and departure of bidders. Previous work have developed a data-driven approach toward developing a taxonomy of strategies employed by bidders in practice when facing multi-unit auctions, but have not considered the sequential bidding problem [26, 2]. Previous work has also sought to provide agents with smarter bidding strategies [4, 3, 5, 1]. Unfortunately, it seems hard to design artificial agents with equilibrium bidding strategies, even for a simple simultaneous ascending price auction. Iwasaki et al. [14] have considered the role of options in the context of a single, monolithic, auction design to help bidders with marginal-increasing values avoid exposure in a multi-unit, homogeneous item auction problem. In other contexts, options have been discussed for selling coal mine leases [23], or as leveled commitment contracts for use in a decentralized market place [24]. Most similar to our work, Gopal et al. [9] use options for reducing the risks of buyers and sellers in the sequential auction problem. However, their work uses costly options and does not remove the sequential bidding problem completely. Work on online mechanisms and online auctions [17, 12, 22] considers agents that can dynamically arrive and depart across time. We leverage a recent price-based characterization by Hajiaghayi et al. [12] to provide a dominant strategy equilibrium for buyers within our options-based protocol. The special case for single-unit buyers is equivalent to the protocol of Hajiaghayi et al., albeit with an options-based interpretation. Jiang and Leyton-Brown [16] use machine learning techniques for bid identification in online auctions. 2. EBAY AND THE DELL E193FP The most common type of auction held on eBay is a singleitem proxy auction. Auctions open at a given time and remain open for a set period of time (usually one week). Bidders bid for the item by giving a proxy a value ceiling. The proxy will bid on behalf of the bidder only as much as is necessary to maintain a winning position in the auction, up to the ceiling received from the bidder. Bidders may communicate with the proxy multiple times before an auction closes. In the event that a bidders proxy has been outbid, a bidder may give the proxy a higher ceiling to use in the auction. eBays proxy auction implements an incremental version of a Vickrey auction, with the item sold to the highest bidder for the second-highest bid plus a small increment. 181 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Number of Auctions NumberofBidders Auctions Available Auctions in Which Bid Figure 1: Histogram of number of LCD auctions available to each bidder and number of LCD auctions in which a bidder participates. The market analyzed in this paper is that of a specific model of an LCD monitor, a 19 Dell LCD model E193FP. This market was selected for a variety of reasons including: • The mean price of the monitor was $240 (with standard deviation $32), so we believe it reasonable to assume that bidders on the whole are only interested in acquiring one copy of the item on eBay.3 • The volume transacted is fairly high, at approximately 500 units sold per month. • The item is not usually bundled with other items. • The item is typically sold as new, and so suitable for the price-matching of the options-based scheme. Raw auction information was acquired via a PERL script. The script accesses the eBay search engine,4 and returns all auctions containing the terms Dell and LCD that have closed within the past month.5 Data was stored in a text file for post-processing. To isolate the auctions in the domain of interest, queries were made against the titles of eBay auctions that closed between 27 May, 2005 through 1 October, 2005.6 Figure 1 provides a general sense of how many LCD auctions occur while a bidder is interested in pursuing a monitor.7 8,746 bidders (86%) had more than one auction available between when they first placed a bid on eBay and the 3 For reference, Dells October 2005 mail order catalogue quotes the price of the monitor as being $379 without a desktop purchase, and $240 as part of a desktop purchase upgrade. 4 http://search.ebay.com 5 The search is not case-sensitive. 6 Specifically, the query found all auctions where the title contained all of the following strings: Dell, LCD and E193FP, while excluding all auctions that contained any of the following strings: Dimension, GHZ, desktop, p4 and GB. The exclusion terms were incorporated so that the only auctions analyzed would be those selling exclusively the LCD of interest. For example, the few bundled auctions selling both a Dell Dimension desktop and the E193FP LCD are excluded. 7 As a reference, most auctions close on eBay between noon and midnight EDT, with almost two auctions for the Dell LCD monitor closing each hour on average during peak time periods. Bidders have an average observed patience of 3.9 days (with a standard deviation of 11.4 days). latest closing time of an auction in which they bid (with an average of 78 auctions available). Figure 1 also illustrates the number of auctions in which each bidder participates. Only 32.3% of bidders who had more than one auction available are observed to bid in more than one auction (bidding in 3.6 auctions on average). A simple regression analysis shows that bidders tend to submit maximal bids to an auction that are $1.22 higher after spending twice as much time in the system, as well as bids that are $0.27 higher in each subsequent auction. Among the 508 bidders that won exactly one monitor and participated in multiple auctions, 201 (40%) paid more than $10 more than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, paying on average $35 more (standard deviation $21) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win. Furthermore, among the 2,216 bidders that never won an item despite participating in multiple auctions, 421 (19%) placed a losing bid in one auction that was more than $10 higher than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, submitting a losing bid on average $34 more (standard deviation $23) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win. Although these measures do not say a bidder that lost could have definitively won (because we only consider the final winning price and not the bid of the winner to her proxy), or a bidder that won could have secured a better price, this is at least indicative of some bidder mistakes. 3. MODELING THE SEQUENTIAL AUCTION PROBLEM While the eBay analysis was for simple bidders who desire only a single item, let us now consider a more general scenario where people may desire multiple goods of different types, possessing general valuations over those goods. Consider a world with buyers (sometimes called bidders) B and K different types of goods G1...GK . Let T = {0, 1, ...} denote time periods. Let L denote a bundle of goods, represented as a vector of size K, where Lk ∈ {0, 1} denotes the quantity of good type Gk in the bundle.8 The type of a buyer i ∈ B is (ai, di, vi), with arrival time ai ∈ T, departure time di ∈ T, and private valuation vi(L) ≥ 0 for each bundle of goods L received between ai and di, and zero value otherwise. The arrival time models the period in which a buyer first realizes her demand and enters the market, while the departure time models the period in which a buyer loses interest in acquiring the good(s). In settings with general valuations, we need an additional assumption: an upper bound on the difference between a buyers arrival and departure, denoted ΔMax. Buyers have quasi-linear utilities, so that the utility of buyer i receiving bundle L and paying p, in some period no later than di, is ui(L, p) = vi(L) − p. Each seller j ∈ S brings a single item kj to the market, has no intrinsic value and wants to maximize revenue. Seller j has an arrival time, aj, which models the period in which she is first interested in listing the item, while the departure time, dj, models the latest period in which she is willing to consider having an auction for the item close. A seller will receive payment by the end of the reported departure of the winning buyer. 8 We extend notation whereby a single item k of type Gk refers to a vector L : Lk = 1. 182 We say an individual auction in a sequence is locally strategyproof (LSP) if truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for a buyer that can only bid in that auction. Consider the following example to see that LSP is insufficient for the existence of a dominant bidding strategy for buyers facing a sequence of auctions. Example 1. Alice values one ton of Sand with one ton of Stone at $2, 000. Bob holds a Vickrey auction for one ton of Sand on Monday and a Vickrey auction for one ton of Stone on Tuesday. Alice has no dominant bidding strategy because she needs to know the price for Stone on Tuesday to know her maximum willingness to pay for Sand on Monday. Definition 1. The sequential auction problem. Given a sequence of auctions, despite each auction being locally strategyproof, a bidder has no dominant bidding strategy. Consider a sequence of auctions. Generally, auctions selling the same item will be uncertainly-ordered, because a buyer will not know the ordering of closing prices among the auctions. Define the interesting bundles for a buyer as all bundles that could maximize the buyers profit for some combination of auctions and bids of other buyers.9 Within the interesting bundles, say that an item has uncertain marginal value if the marginal value of an item depends on the other goods held by the buyer.10 Say that an item is oversupplied if there is more than one auction offering an item of that type. Say two bundles are substitutes if one of those bundles has the same value as the union of both bundles.11 Proposition 1. Given locally strategyproof single-item auctions, the sequential auction problem exists for a bidder if and only if either of the following two conditions is true: (1) within the set of interesting bundles (a) there are two bundles that are substitutes, (b) there is an item with uncertain marginal value, or (c) there is an item that is over-supplied; (2) a bidder faces competitors bids that are conditioned on the bidders past bids. Proof. (Sketch.)(⇐) A bidder does not have a dominant strategy when (a) she does not know which bundle among substitutes to pursue, (b) she faces the exposure problem, or (c) she faces the multiple copies problem. Additionally, a bidder does not have a dominant strategy when she does not how to optimally influence the bids of competitors.(⇒) By contradiction. A bidder has a dominant strategy to bid its constant marginal value for a given item in each auction available when conditions (1) and (2) are both false. For example, the following buyers all face the sequential auction problem as a result of condition (a), (b) and (c) respectively: a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000, or one ton of Stone for $2,000, but not both Sand and Stone; a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000, one ton of Stone for $300, and one ton of Sand and one ton of Stone for $1,500, and can participate in an auction for Sand before an auction for Stone; a buyer who values one ton of Sand for $1,000 and can participate in many auctions selling Sand. 9 Assume that the empty set is an interesting bundle. 10 Formally, an item k has uncertain marginal value if |{m : m = vi(Q) − vi(Q − k), ∀Q ⊆ L ∈ InterestingBundle, Q ⊇ k}| > 1. 11 Formally, two bundles A and B are substitutes if vi(A ∪ B) = max(vi(A), vi(B)), where A ∪ B = L where Lk = max(Ak, Bk). 4. SUPER PROXIES AND OPTIONS The novel solution proposed in this work to resolve the sequential auction problem consists of two primary components: richer proxy agents, and options with price matching. In finance, a real option is a right to acquire a real good at a certain price, called the exercise price. For instance, Alice may obtain from Bob the right to buy Sand from him at an exercise price of $1, 000. An option provides the right to purchase a good at an exercise price but not the obligation. This flexibility allows buyers to put together a collection of options on goods and then decide which to exercise. Options are typically sold at a price called the option price. However, options obtained at a non-zero option price cannot generally support a simple, dominant bidding strategy, as a buyer must compute the expected value of an option to justify the cost [8]. This computation requires a model of the future, which in our setting requires a model of the bidding strategies and the values of other bidders. This is the very kind of game-theoretic reasoning that we want to avoid. Instead, we consider costless options with an option price of zero. This will require some care as buyers are weakly better off with a costless option than without one, whatever its exercise price. However, multiple bidders pursuing options with no intention of exercising them would cause the efficiency of an auction for options to unravel. This is the role of the mandatory proxy agents, which intermediate between buyers and the market. A proxy agent forces a link between the valuation function used to acquire options and the valuation used to exercise options. If a buyer tells her proxy an inflated value for an item, she runs the risk of having the proxy exercise options at a price greater than her value. 4.1 Buyer Proxies 4.1.1 Acquiring Options After her arrival, a buyer submits her valuation ˆvi (perhaps untruthfully) to her proxy in some period ˆai ≥ ai, along with a claim about her departure time ˆdi ≥ ˆai. All transactions are intermediated via proxy agents. Each auction is modified to sell an option on that good to the highest bidding proxy, with an initial exercise price set to the second-highest bid received.12 When an option in which a buyer is interested becomes available for the first time, the proxy determines its bid by computing the buyers maximum marginal value for the item, and then submits a bid in this amount. A proxy does not bid for an item when it already holds an option. The bid price is: bidt i(k) = max L [ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)] (1) By having a proxy compute a buyers maximum marginal value for an item and then bidding only that amount, a buyers proxy will win any auction that could possibly be of benefit to the buyer and only lose those auctions that could never be of value to the buyer. 12 The system can set a reserve price for each good, provided that the reserve is universal for all auctions selling the same item. Without a universal reserve price, price matching is not possible because of the additional restrictions on prices that individual sellers will accept. 183 Buyer Type Monday Tuesday Molly (Mon, Tues, $8) 6Nancy 6Nancy → 4Polly Nancy (Mon, Tues, $6) - 4Polly Polly (Mon, Tues, $4) -Table 1: Three-buyer example with each wanting a single item and one auction occurring on Monday and Tuesday. XY implies an option with exercise price X and bookkeeping that a proxy has prevented Y from currently possessing an option. → is the updating of exercise price and bookkeeping. When a proxy wins an auction for an option, the proxy will store in its local memory the identity (which may be a pseudonym) of the proxy not holding an option because of the proxys win (i.e., the proxy that it bumped from winning, if any). This information will be used for price matching. 4.1.2 Pricing Options Sellers agree by joining the market to allow the proxy representing a buyer to adjust the exercise price of an option that it holds downwards if the proxy discovers that it could have achieved a better price by waiting to bid in a later auction for an option on the same good. To assist in the implementation of the price matching scheme each proxy tracks future auctions for an option that it has already won and will determine who would be bidding in that auction had the proxy delayed its entry into the market until this later auction. The proxy will request price matching from the seller that granted it an option if the proxy discovers that it could have secured a lower price by waiting. To reiterate, the proxy does not acquire more than one option for any good. Rather, it reduces the exercise price on its already issued option if a better deal is found. The proxy is able to discover these deals by asking each future auction to report the identities of the bidders in that auction together with their bids. This needs to be enforced by eBay, as the central authority. The highest bidder in this later auction, across those whose identity is not stored in the proxys memory for the given item, is exactly the bidder against whom the proxy would be competing had it delayed its entry until this auction. If this high bid is lower than the current option price held, the proxy price matches down to this high bid price. After price matching, one of two adjustments will be made by the proxy for bookkeeping purposes. If the winner of the auction is the bidder whose identity has been in the proxys local memory, the proxy will replace that local information with the identity of the bidder whose bid it just price matched, as that is now the bidder the proxy has prevented from obtaining an option. If the auction winners identity is not stored in the proxys local memory the memory may be cleared. In this case, the proxy will simply price match against the bids of future auction winners on this item until the proxy departs. Example 2 (Table 1). Mollys proxy wins the Monday auction, submitting a bid of $8 and receiving an option for $6. Mollys proxy adds Nancy to its local memory as Nancys proxy would have won had Mollys proxy not bid. On Tuesday, only Nancys and Pollys proxy bid (as Mollys proxy holds an option), with Nancys proxy winning an opBuyer Type Monday Tuesday Truth: Molly (Mon, Mon, $8) 6NancyNancy (Mon, Tues, $6) - 4Polly Polly (Mon, Tues, $4) -Misreport: Molly (Mon, Mon, $8) -Nancy (Mon, Tues, $10) 8Molly 8Molly → 4φ Polly (Mon, Tues, $4) - 0φ Misreport & match low: Molly (Mon, Mon, $8) -Nancy (Mon, Tues, $10) 8 8 → 0 Polly (Mon, Tues, $4) - 0 Table 2: Examples demonstrating why bookkeeping will lead to a truthful system whereas simply matching to the lowest winning price will not. tion for $4 and noting that it bumped Pollys proxy. At this time, Mollys proxy will price match its option down to $4 and replace Nancy with Polly in its local memory as per the price match algorithm, as Polly would be holding an option had Molly never bid. 4.1.3 Exercising Options At the reported departure time the proxy chooses which options to exercise. Therefore, a seller of an option must wait until period ˆdw for the option to be exercised and receive payment, where w was the winner of the option.13 For bidder i, in period ˆdi, the proxy chooses the option(s) that maximize the (reported) utility of the buyer: θ∗ t = argmax θ⊆Θ (ˆvi(γ(θ)) − π(θ)) (2) where Θ is the set of all options held, γ(θ) are the goods corresponding to a set of options, and π(θ) is the sum of exercise prices for a set of options. All other options are returned.14 No options are exercised when no combination of options have positive utility. 4.1.4 Why bookkeep and not match winning price? One may believe that an alternative method for implementing a price matching scheme could be to simply have proxies match the lowest winning price they observe after winning an option. However, as demonstrated in Table 2, such a simple price matching scheme will not lead to a truthful system. The first scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome if all agents were to truthfully report their types. Molly 13 While this appears restrictive on the seller, we believe it not significantly different than what sellers on eBay currently endure in practice. An auction on eBay closes at a specific time, but a seller must wait until a buyer relinquishes payment before being able to realize the revenue, an amount of time that could easily be days (if payment is via a money order sent through courier) to much longer (if a buyer is slow but not overtly delinquent in remitting her payment). 14 Presumably, an option returned will result in the seller holding a new auction for an option on the item it still possesses. However, the system will not allow a seller to re-auction an option until ΔMax after the option had first been issued in order to maintain a truthful mechanism. 184 would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $6 (subsequently exercising that option at the end of Monday), and Nancy would win the Tuesday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $4 (subsequently exercising that option at the end of Tuesday). The second scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome if Nancy were to misreport her value for the good by reporting an inflated value of $10, using the proposed bookkeeping method. Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $8. On Tuesday, Polly would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $0. Nancys proxy would observe that the highest bid submitted on Tuesday among those proxies not stored in local memory is Pollys bid of $4, and so Nancys proxy would price match the exercise price of its option down to $4. Note that the exercise price Nancys proxy has obtained at the end of Tuesday is the same as when she truthfully revealed her type to her proxy. The third scenario in Table 2 demonstrates the outcome if Nancy were to misreport her value for the good by reporting an inflated value of $10, if the price matching scheme were for proxies to simply match their option price to the lowest winning price at any time while they are in the system. Nancy would win the Monday auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $8. On Tuesday, Polly would win the auction and receive an option with an exercise price of $0. Nancys proxy would observe that the lowest price on Tuesday was $0, and so Nancys proxy would price match the exercise price of its option down to $0. Note that the exercise price Nancys proxy has obtained at the end of Tuesday is lower than when she truthfully revealed her type to the proxy. Therefore, a price matching policy of simply matching the lowest price paid may not elicit truthful information from buyers. 4.2 Complexity of Algorithm An XOR-valuation of size M for buyer i is a set of M terms, < L1 , v1 i > ...< LM , vM i >, that maps distinct bundles to values, where i is interested in acquiring at most one such bundle. For any bundle S, vi(S) = maxLm⊆S(vm i ). Theorem 1. Given an XOR-valuation which possesses M terms, there is an O(KM2 ) algorithm for computing all maximum marginal values, where K is the number of different item types in which a buyer may be interested. Proof. For each item type, recall Equation 1 which defines the maximum marginal value of an item. For each bundle L in the M-term valuation, vi(L + k) may be found by iterating over the M terms. Therefore, the number of terms explored to determine the maximum marginal value for any item is O(M2 ), and so the total number of bundle comparisons to be performed to calculate all maximum marginal values is O(KM2 ). Theorem 2. The total memory required by a proxy for implementing price matching is O(K), where K is the number of distinct item types. The total work performed by a proxy to conduct price matching in each auction is O(1). Proof. By construction of the algorithm, the proxy stores one maximum marginal value for each item for bidding, of which there are O(K); at most one buyers identity for each item, of which there are O(K); and one current option exercise price for each item, of which there are O(K). For each auction, the proxy either submits a precomputed bid or price matches, both of which take O(1) work. 4.3 Truthful Bidding to the Proxy Agent Proxies transform the market into a direct revelation mechanism, where each buyer i interacts with the proxy only once,15 and does so by declaring a bid, bi, which is defined as an announcement of her type, (ˆai, ˆdi, ˆvi), where the announcement may or may not be truthful. We denote all received bids other than is as b−i. Given bids, b = (bi, b−i), the market determines allocations, xi(b), and payments, pi(b) ≥ 0, to each buyer (using an online algorithm). A dominant strategy equilibrium for buyers requires that vi(xi(bi, b−i))−pi(bi, b−i) ≥ vi(xi(bi, b−i))−pi(bi, b−i), ∀bi = bi, ∀b−i. We now establish that it is a dominant strategy for a buyer to reveal her true valuation and true departure time to her proxy agent immediately upon arrival to the system. The proof builds on the price-based characterization of strategyproof single-item online auctions in Hajiaghayi et al. [12]. Define a monotonic and value-independent price function psi(ai, di, L, v−i) which can depend on the values of other agents v−i. Price psi(ai, di, L, v−i) will represent the price available to agent i for bundle L in the mechanism if it announces arrival time ai and departure time di. The price is independent of the value vi of agent i, but can depend on ai, di and L as long as it satisfies a monotonicity condition. Definition 2. Price function psi(ai, di, L, v−i) is monotonic if psi(ai, di, L , v−i) ≤ psi(ai, di, L, v−i) for all ai ≤ ai, all di ≥ di, all bundles L ⊆ L and all v−i. Lemma 1. An online combinatorial auction will be strategyproof (with truthful reports of arrival, departure and value a dominant strategy) when there exists a monotonic and value-independent price function, psi(ai, di, L, v−i), such that for all i and all ai, di ∈ T and all vi, agent i is allocated bundle L∗ = argmaxL [vi(L) − psi(ai, di, L, v−i)] in period di and makes payment psi(ai, di, L∗ , v−i). Proof. Agent i cannot benefit from reporting a later departure ˆdi because the allocation is made in period ˆdi and the agent would have no value for this allocation. Agent i cannot benefit from reporting a later arrival ˆai ≥ ai or earlier departure ˆdi ≤ di because of price monotonicity. Finally, the agent cannot benefit from reporting some ˆvi = vi because its reported valuation does not change the prices it faces and the mechanism maximizes its utility given its reported valuation and given the prices. Lemma 2. At any given time, there is at most one buyer in the system whose proxy does not hold an option for a given item type because of buyer is presence in the system, and the identity of that buyer will be stored in is proxys local memory at that time if such a buyer exists. Proof. By induction. Consider the first proxy that a buyer prevents from winning an option. Either (a) the 15 For analysis purposes, we view the mechanism as an opaque market so that the buyer cannot condition her bid on bids placed by others. 185 bumped proxy will leave the system having never won an option, or (b) the bumped proxy will win an auction in the future. If (a), the buyers presence prevented exactly that one buyer from winning an option, but will have not prevented any other proxies from winning an option (as the buyers proxy will not bid on additional options upon securing one), and will have had that bumped proxys identity in its local memory by definition of the algorithm. If (b), the buyer has not prevented the bumped proxy from winning an option after all, but rather has prevented only the proxy that lost to the bumped proxy from winning (if any), whose identity will now be stored in the proxys local memory by definition of the algorithm. For this new identity in the buyers proxys local memory, either scenario (a) or (b) will be true, ad infinitum. Given this, we show that the options-based infrastructure implements a price-based auction with a monotonic and value-independent price schedule to every agent. Theorem 3. Truthful revelation of valuation, arrival and departure is a dominant strategy for a buyer in the optionsbased market. Proof. First, define a simple agent-independent price function pk i (t, v−i) as the highest bid by the proxies not holding an option on an item of type Gk at time t, not including the proxy representing i herself and not including any proxies that would have already won an option had i never entered the system (i.e., whose identity is stored in is proxys local memory)(∞ if no supply at t). This set of proxies is independent of any declaration i makes to its proxy (as the set explicitly excludes the at most one proxy (see Lemma 2) that i has prevented from holding an option), and each bid submitted by a proxy within this set is only a function of their own buyers declared valuation (see Equation 1). Furthermore, i cannot influence the supply she faces as any options returned by bidders due to a price set by is proxys bid will be re-auctioned after i has departed the system. Therefore, pk i (t, v−i) is independent of is declaration to its proxy. Next, define psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) = minˆai≤τ≤ ˆdi [pk i (τ, v−i)] (possibly ∞) as the minimum price over pk i (t, v−i), which is clearly monotonic. By construction of price matching, this is exactly the price obtained by a proxy on any option that it holds at departure. Define psi(ˆai, ˆdi, L, v−i) = Èk=K k=1 psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i)Lk, which is monotonic in ˆai, ˆdi and L since psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) is monotonic in ˆai and ˆdi and (weakly) greater than zero for each k. Given the set of options held at ˆdi, which may be a subset of those items with non-infinite prices, the proxy exercises options to maximize the reported utility. Left to show is that all bundles that could not be obtained with options held are priced sufficiently high as to not be preferred. For each such bundle, either there is an item priced at ∞ (in which case the bundle would not be desired) or there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy does not hold an option that was available. In all auctions for such an item there must have been a distinct bidder with a bid greater than bidt i(k), which subsequently results in psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) > bidt i(k), and so the bundle without k would be preferred to the bundle. Theorem 4. The super proxy, options-based scheme is individually-rational for both buyers and sellers. Price σ(Price) Value Surplus eBay $240.24 $32 $244 $4 Options $239.66 $12 $263 $23 Table 3: Average price paid, standard deviation of prices paid, average bidder value among winners, and average winning bidder surplus on eBay for Dell E193FP LCD screens as well as the simulated options-based market using worst-case estimates of bidders true value. Proof. By construction, the proxy exercises the profit maximizing set of options obtained, or no options if no set of options derives non-negative surplus. Therefore, buyers are guaranteed non-negative surplus by participating in the scheme. For sellers, the price of each option is based on a non-negative bid or zero. 5. EVALUATING THE OPTIONS / PROXY INFRASTRUCTURE A goal of the empirical benchmarking and a reason to collect data from eBay is to try and build a realistic model of buyers from which to estimate seller revenue and other market effects under the options-based scheme. We simulate a sequence of auctions that match the timing of the Dell LCD auctions on eBay.16 When an auction successfully closes on eBay, we simulate a Vickrey auction for an option on the item sold in that period. Auctions that do not successfully close on eBay are not simulated. We estimate the arrival, departure and value of each bidder on eBay from their observed behavior.17 Arrival is estimated as the first time that a bidder interacts with the eBay proxy, while departure is estimated as the latest closing time among eBay auctions in which a bidder participates. We initially adopt a particularly conservative estimate for bidder value, estimating it as the highest bid a bidder was observed to make on eBay. Table 3 compares the distribution of closing prices on eBay and in the simulated options scheme. While the average revenue in both schemes is virtually the same ($239.66 in the options scheme vs. $240.24 on eBay), the winners in the options scheme tend to value the item won 7% more than the winners on eBay ($263 in the options scheme vs. $244 on eBay). 5.1 Bid Identification We extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to sequential auctions to get a better view of underlying bidder values. Rather than assume for bidders an equilibrium behavior as in standard econometric techniques, Haile and Tamer do not attempt to model how bidders true values get mapped into a bid in any given auction. Rather, in the context of repeated 16 When running the simulations, the results of the first and final ten days of auctions are not recorded to reduce edge effects that come from viewing a discrete time window of a continuous process. 17 For the 100 bidders that won multiple times on eBay, we have each one bid a constant marginal value for each additional item in each auction until the number of options held equals the total number of LCDs won on eBay, with each option available for price matching independently. This bidding strategy is not a dominant strategy (falling outside the type space possible for buyers on which the proof of truthfulness has been built), but is believed to be the most appropriate first order action for simulation. 186 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Value ($) CDF Observed Max Bids Upper Bound of True Value Figure 2: CDF of maximum bids observed and upper bound estimate of the bidding populations distribution for maximum willingness to pay. The true population distribution lies below the estimated upper bound. single-item auctions with distinct bidder populations, Haile and Tamer make only the following two assumptions when estimating the distribution of true bidder values: 1. Bidders do not bid more than they are willing to pay. 2. Bidders do not allow an opponent to win at a price they are willing to beat. From the first of their two assumptions, given the bids placed by each bidder in each auction, Haile and Tamer derive a method for estimating an upper bound of the bidding populations true value distribution (i.e., the bound that lies above the true value distribution). From the second of their two assumptions, given the winning price of each auction, Haile and Tamer derive a method for estimating a lower bound of the bidding populations true value distribution. It is only the upper-bound of the distribution that we utilize in our work. Haile and Tamer assume that bidders only participate in a single auction, and require independence of the bidding population from auction to auction. Neither assumption is valid here: the former because bidders are known to bid in more than one auction, and the latter because the set of bidders in an auction is in all likelihood not a true i.i.d. sampling of the overall bidding population. In particular, those who win auctions are less likely to bid in successive auctions, while those who lose auctions are more likely to remain bidders in future auctions. In applying their methods we make the following adjustments: • Within a given auction, each individual bidders true willingness to pay is assumed weakly greater than the maximum bid that bidder submits across all auctions for that item (either past or future). • When estimating the upper bound of the value distribution, if a bidder bids in more than one auction, randomly select one of the auctions in which the bidder bid, and only utilize that one observation during the estimation.18 18 In current work, we assume that removing duplicate bidders is sufficient to make the buying populations independent i.i.d. draws from auction to auction. If one believes that certain portions of the population are drawn to cerPrice σ(Price) Value Surplus eBay $240.24 $32 $281 $40 Options $275.80 $14 $302 $26 Table 4: Average price paid, standard deviation of prices paid, average bidder value among winners, and average winning bidder surplus on eBay for Dell E193FP LCD screens as well as in the simulated options-based market using an adjusted Haile and Tamer estimate of bidders true values being 15% higher than their maximum observed bid. Figure 2 provides the distribution of maximum bids placed by bidders on eBay as well as the estimated upper bound of the true value distribution of bidders based on the extended Haile and Tamer method.19 As can be seen, the smallest relative gap between the two curves meaningfully occurs near the 80th percentile, where the upper bound is 1.17 times the maximum bid. Therefore, adopted as a less conservative model of bidder values is a uniform scaling factor of 1.15. We now present results from this less conservative analysis. Table 4 shows the distribution of closing prices in auctions on eBay and in the simulated options scheme. The mean price in the options scheme is now significantly higher, 15% greater, than the prices on eBay ($276 in the options scheme vs. $240 on eBay), while the standard deviation of closing prices is lower among the options scheme auctions ($14 in the options scheme vs. $32 on eBay). Therefore, not only is the expected revenue stream higher, but the lower variance provides sellers a greater likelihood of realizing that higher revenue. The efficiency of the options scheme remains higher than on eBay. The winners in the options scheme now have an average estimated value 7.5% higher at $302. In an effort to better understand this efficiency, we formulated a mixed integer program (MIP) to determine a simple estimate of the allocative efficiency of eBay. The MIP computes the efficient value of the oﬄine problem with full hindsight on all bids and all supply.20 Using a scaling of 1.15, the total value allocated to eBay winners is estimated at $551,242, while the optimal value (from the MIP) is $593,301. This suggests an allocative efficiency of 92.9%: while the typical value of a winner on eBay is $281, an average value of $303 was possible.21 Note the options-based tain auctions, then further adjustments would be required in order to utilize these techniques. 19 The estimation of the points in the curve is a minimization over many variables, many of which can have smallnumbers bias. Consequently, Haile and Tamer suggest using a weighted average over all terms yi of È i yi exp(yiρ)Èj exp(yj ρ) to approximate the minimum while reducing the small number effects. We used ρ = −1000 and removed observations of auctions with 17 bidders or more as they occurred very infrequently. However, some small numbers bias still demonstrated itself with the plateau in our upper bound estimate around a value of $300. 20 Buyers who won more than one item on eBay are cloned so that they appear to be multiple bidders of identical type. 21 As long as one believes that every bidders true value is a constant factor α away from their observed maximum bid, the 92.9% efficiency calculation holds for any value of α. In practice, this belief may not be reasonable. For example, if losing bidders tend to have true values close to their observed 187 scheme comes very close to achieving this level of efficiency [at 99.7% efficient in this estimate] even though it operates without the benefit of hindsight. Finally, although the typical winning bidder surplus decreases between eBay and the options-based scheme, some surplus redistribution would be possible because the total market efficiency is improved.22 6. DISCUSSION The biggest concern with our scheme is that proxy agents who may be interested in many different items may acquire many more options than they finally exercise. This can lead to efficiency loss. Notice that this is not an issue when bidders are only interested in a single item (as in our empirical study), or have linear-additive values on items. To fix this, we would prefer to have proxy agents use more caution in acquiring options and use a more adaptive bidding strategy than that in Equation 1. For instance, if a proxy is already holding an option with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the second item. We formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along these lines. Let Θt be the set of all options a proxy for bidder i already possesses at time t. Let θt ⊆ Θt, be a subset of those options, the sum of whose exercise prices are π(θt), and the goods corresponding to those options being γ(θt). Let Π(θt) = ˆvi(γ(θt)) − π(θt) be the (reported) available surplus associated with a set of options. Let θ∗ t be the set of options currently held that would maximize the buyers surplus; i.e., θ∗ t = argmaxθt⊆Θt Π(θt). Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an option on the item given the current options held. This can be computed as follows: bidt i(k) = max L [0, min[ˆvi(L + k) − Π(θ∗ t ), ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)]] (3) where ˆvi(L+k)−Π(θ∗ t ) considers surplus already held, ˆvi(L+ k)−ˆvi(L) considers the marginal value of a good, and taking the max[0, .] considers the overall use of pursuing the good. However, and somewhat counter intuitively, we are not able to implement this bidding scheme without forfeiting truthfulness. The Π(θ∗ t ) term in Equation 3 (i.e., the amount of guaranteed surplus bidder i has already obtained) can be influenced by proxy js bid. Therefore, bidder j may have the incentive to misrepresent her valuation to her proxy if she believes doing so will cause i to bid differently in the future in a manner beneficial to j. Consider the following example where the proxy scheme is refined to bid the maximum willingness to pay. Example 3. Alice values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $2,000. Bob values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $1,500. All bidders have a patience maximum bids while eBay winners have true values much greater than their observed maximum bids then downward bias is introduced in the efficiency calculation at present. 22 The increase in eBay winner surplus between Tables 3 and 4 is to be expected as the α scaling strictly increases the estimated value of the eBay winners while holding the prices at which they won constant. of 2 days. On day one, a Sand auction is held, where Alices proxy bids $2,000 and Bobs bids $1,500. Alices proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $1,500. On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alices proxy bids $1,500 [as she has already obtained a guaranteed $500 of surplus from winning a Sand option, and so reduces her Stone bid by this amount], and Bobs bids $1,500. Either Alices proxy or Bobs proxy will win the Stone option. At the end of the second day, Alices proxy holds an option with an exercise price of $1,500 to obtain a good valued for $2,000, and so obtains $500 in surplus. Now, consider what would have happened had Alice declared that she valued only Stone. Example 4. Alice declares valuing only Stone for $2,000. Bob values either one ton of Sand or one ton of Stone for $1,500. All bidders have a patience of 2 days. On day one, a Sand auction is held, where Bobs proxy bids $1,500. Bobs proxy wins an option to purchase Sand for $0. On day two, a Stone auction is held, where Alices proxy bids $2,000, and Bobs bids $0 [as he has already obtained a guaranteed $1,500 of surplus from winning a Sand option, and so reduces his Stone bid by this amount]. Alices proxy wins the Stone option for $0. At the end of the second day, Alices proxy holds an option with an exercise price of $0 to obtain a good valued for $2,000, and so obtains $2,000 in surplus. By misrepresenting her valuation (i.e., excluding her value of Sand), Alice was able to secure higher surplus by guiding Bobs bid for Stone to $0. An area of immediate further work by the authors is to develop a more sophisticated proxy agent that can allow for bidding of maximum willingness to pay (Equation 3) while maintaining truthfulness. An additional, practical, concern with our proxy scheme is that we assume an available, trusted, and well understood method to characterize goods (and presumably the quality of goods). We envision this happening in practice by sellers defining a classification for their item upon entering the market, for instance via a UPC code. Just as in eBay, this would allow an opportunity for sellers to improve revenue by overstating the quality of their item (new vs. like new), and raises the issue of how well a reputation scheme could address this. 7. CONCLUSIONS We introduced a new sales channel, consisting of an optionsbased and proxied auction protocol, to address the sequential auction problem that exists when bidders face multiple auctions for substitutes and complements goods. Our scheme provides bidders with a simple, dominant and truthful bidding strategy even though the market remains open and dynamic. In addition to exploring more sophisticated proxies that bid in terms of maximum willingness to pay, future work should aim to better model seller incentives and resolve the strategic problems facing sellers. For instance, does the options scheme change seller incentives from what they currently are on eBay? Acknowledgments We would like to thank Pai-Ling Yin.

División de Ingeniería de Juda y Ciencias Aplicadas Harvard University, Harvard Business School ajuda@hbs.edu David C. División de Ingeniería de Parques y Ciencias Aplicadas Harvard University Parkes@EECS.Harvard.edu Los postores de abstracto en eBay no tienen una estrategia de licitación dominante cuando se enfrentan a múltiples subastas que ofrecen un elemento de interés. Como se ve a través de un análisis de 1.956 subastas en eBay para un monitor LCD Dell E193FP, algunos postores ganan subastas a precios más altos que los de otras subastas disponibles, mientras que otros nunca ganan una subasta a pesar de colocar ofertas en los esfuerzos perdedores que son mayores que los precios de cierrede otras subastas disponibles. Estas desacuerdo en el comportamiento estratégico obstaculizan la eficiencia del sistema y, al hacerlo, limitan el potencial de ingresos para los vendedores. Este documento propone una nueva extensión basada en opciones para el sistema de facturación por poder eBays que resuelve este problema estratégico para los compradores en los mercados comerciales. Un análisis empírico de eBay proporciona una base para las simulaciones por computadora que investigan los efectos del mercado del esquema basado en opciones, y demuestra que el esquema basado en opciones proporciona una mayor eficiencia que eBay, al tiempo que aumenta los ingresos del vendedor.

Introducción Los mercados electrónicos representan una aplicación de sistemas de información que ha generado nuevas oportunidades de comercio significativas al tiempo que permite el precio dinámico de los bienes. Además de los mercados como eBay, los mercados electrónicos se utilizan cada vez más para las subastas de negocios a consumidores (por ejemplo, para vender inventario excedente [19]). Muchos autores han escrito sobre un futuro en el que el comercio está mediado por agentes comerciales automatizados en línea [10, 25, 1]. Sin embargo, todavía hay poca evidencia de comercio automatizado en los mercados electrónicos. Creemos que un lugar principal de resistencia es la falta de estrategias de licitación probablemente óptimas para cualquiera que los diseños más simples de mercado. Sin esto, no esperamos que los consumidores individuales, o las empresas, confíen en colocar sus negocios en manos de un agente automatizado. Uno de los ejemplos más comunes de hoy de un mercado electrónico es eBay, donde el volumen de mercancías brutas (es decir, la suma de todos los listados cerrados con éxito) durante 2005 fue de $ 44B. Entre los elementos enumerados en eBay, muchos son esencialmente idénticos. Esto es especialmente cierto en la categoría de electrónica de consumo [9], que representó aproximadamente $ 3.5B de volumen de mercancías brutas de eBays en 2005. Esta presencia de artículos esencialmente idénticos puede exponer a los postores y vendedores a riesgos debido al problema de subasta secuencial. Por ejemplo, Alice puede querer un monitor LCD, y potencialmente podría ofertar en una subasta de 1 en punto o 3 en punto de Ebay. Si bien Alice preferiría participar en cualquier subasta que tenga el precio ganador más bajo, no puede determinar de antemano qué subasta puede ser, y podría terminar ganando la subasta incorrecta. Este es un problema de múltiples copias. Otro problema que los licitadores pueden enfrentar es el problema de exposición. Según lo investigado por Bykowsky et al.[6], existen problemas de exposición cuando los compradores desean un paquete de productos, pero solo pueden participar en subastas de un solo ítems.1 Por ejemplo, si Alice valora una consola de videojuegos por sí sola por $ 200, un videojuego por sí mismo por $ 30, y ambosUna consola y un juego por $ 250, Alice debe determinar cuánto de los $ 20 de valor de sinergia podría incluir solo en su oferta por la consola. Ambos problemas surgen en eBay como resultado de subastas secuenciales de elementos individuales junto con postores de pacientes con sustitutos o valoraciones complementarias. ¿Por qué podría ser malo el problema de la subasta secuencial? Los juegos complejos pueden llevar a los postores que empleen estrategias costosas y cometan errores. Los postores potenciales que no desean asumir tales costos pueden optar por no participar en el problema de exposición 1 ha sido investigado principalmente por Bykowsky et al.En el contexto de subastas simultáneas de un solo elemento. El problema también es familiar de la toma de decisiones en línea.180 mercado, inhibiendo las oportunidades de ingresos del vendedor. Además, entre aquellos postores que eligen participar, los errores cometidos pueden conducir a asignaciones ineficientes, lo que limita aún más las oportunidades de ingresos. Estamos interesados en crear modificaciones a los mercados de estilo eBay que simplifican el problema del postor, lo que lleva a estrategias de equilibrio simples y preferiblemente una mejor eficiencia e propiedades de ingresos.1.1 Opciones + proxies: Las tiendas minoristas de soluciones propuestas han desarrollado políticas para ayudar a sus clientes a abordar problemas de compra secuenciales. Las políticas de devolución alivian el problema de exposición al permitir que los clientes devuelvan los productos al precio de compra. La coincidencia de precios alivia el problema de las copias múltiples al permitir que los compradores reciban de los vendedores después de comprar la diferencia entre el precio pagado por un bien y un precio más bajo encontrado en otro lugar por el mismo bien [7, 15, 18]. Además, la coincidencia de precios puede reducir el impacto de exactamente cuando un vendedor trae un artículo al mercado, ya que el precio será establecido en parte por otros que venden el mismo artículo. Estas dos políticas minoristas proporcionan la base para el esquema propuesto en este documento.2 Extendemos la tecnología de licitación proxy actualmente empleada por eBay. Nuestra extensión súper proxima aprovechará una nueva infraestructura de mercado basada en opciones basada en las opciones que permite estrategias simples, pero óptimas y óptimas. Las extensiones son computacionalmente simples, manejan problemas temporales y retienen la autonomía del vendedor para decidir cuándo ingresar al mercado y realizar subastas individuales. Un vendedor vende una opción para un bien, que finalmente conducirá a una venta del bien o al regreso de la opción. Los compradores interactúan a través de un agente proxy, definiendo un valor en todos los paquetes posibles de bienes en los que tienen interés junto con el último período de tiempo en el que están dispuestos a esperar para recibir los buenos (s). Los agentes proxy usan esta información para determinar cuánto ofertar por opciones y seguir una estrategia de licitación dominante en todas las subastas relevantes. Un agente proxy ejerce opciones mantenidas cuando la paciencia de los compradores ha expirado, eligiendo opciones que maximicen el pago de los compradores dada la valoración reportada. Todas las demás opciones se devuelven al mercado y no se ejercen. El protocolo basado en opciones hace que la revelación veracil e inmediata a un proxy sea una estrategia dominante para los compradores, sea cual sea la dinámica de la subasta futura. Realizamos un análisis empírico de eBay, recopilando datos sobre más de cuatro meses de ofertas para pantallas LCD Dell (modelo E193FP) a partir del verano de 2005. Las pantallas LCD son un elemento de alto precio, para el cual demostramos evidencia del problema de licitación secuencial. Primero inferimos un modelo conservador para la hora de llegada, el tiempo de salida y el valor de los postores en eBay para pantallas LCD durante este período. Este modelo se utiliza para simular el rendimiento de la infraestructura basada en opciones, para hacer comparaciones directas con el rendimiento real de eBay en este mercado. También ampliamos el trabajo de Haile y Tamer [11] para estimar un límite superior en la distribución del valor de los postores de eBay, teniendo en cuenta el problema de subasta secuencial al hacer los ajustes. Usando esta estimación, se puede aproximar cuánto mayor valor de los postores es el valor de 2 trabajo previo ha demostrado que la coincidencia de precios es un mecanismo potencial para que las empresas coluden que establezcan precios de monopolio. Sin embargo, en nuestro contexto, los precios de la subasta serán igualados, que no son establecidos explícitamente por los vendedores, sino por las ofertas de compradores.Desde la oferta máxima, se observó que se colocaron en eBay. En base a esta aproximación, los ingresos generados en una simulación del esquema basado en opciones exceden los ingresos en eBay para la población comparable y la secuencia de subastas en un 14.8%, mientras que el esquema basado en opciones se demuestra que es un 7.5% más eficiente.1.2 Trabajo relacionado Varios autores [27, 13, 28, 29] han analizado el problema de copias múltiples, a menudo en el contexto de categorizar o modelar el comportamiento de francotirador por razones distintas a las que se presentan por primera vez por Ockenfels y Roth [20]. Estos documentos realizan un análisis de equilibrio en entornos más simples, suponiendo que los licitadores puedan participar como máximo dos subastas. Peters y Severinov [21] extienden estos modelos para permitir a los compradores considerar un número arbitrario de subastas y caracterizar un equilibrio bayesiano perfecto. Sin embargo, su modelo no permite que las subastas se cierren en tiempos distintos y no considera la llegada y la salida de los postores. Trabajos anteriores han desarrollado un enfoque basado en datos para desarrollar una taxonomía de estrategias empleadas por los postores en la práctica cuando se enfrentan a subastas de unidades múltiples, pero no han considerado el problema de licitación secuencial [26, 2]. El trabajo anterior también ha tratado de proporcionar a los agentes estrategias de licitación más inteligentes [4, 3, 5, 1]. Desafortunadamente, parece difícil diseñar agentes artificiales con estrategias de licitación de equilibrio, incluso para una subasta de precios ascendente simultánea simple. Iwasaki et al.[14] han considerado el papel de las opciones en el contexto de un diseño de subasta único, monolítico y para ayudar a los postores con valores de aumento marginal para evitar la exposición en un problema de subasta de elementos homogéneo múltiple. En otros contextos, se han discutido opciones para vender arrendamientos de minas de carbón [23], o como contratos de compromiso nivelados para su uso en un mercado descentralizado [24]. Lo más similar a nuestro trabajo, Gopal et al.[9] Use opciones para reducir los riesgos de compradores y vendedores en el problema de subasta secuencial. Sin embargo, su trabajo utiliza opciones costosas y no elimina el problema de licitación secuencial por completo. El trabajo en mecanismos en línea y subastas en línea [17, 12, 22] considera a los agentes que pueden llegar dinámicamente y partir a través del tiempo. Aprovechamos una caracterización reciente basada en precios de Hajiaghayi et al.[12] Para proporcionar un equilibrio de estrategia dominante para los compradores dentro de nuestro protocolo basado en opciones. El caso especial para compradores de una sola unidad es equivalente al protocolo de Hajiaghayi et al., Aunque con una interpretación basada en opciones. Jiang y Leyton-Brown [16] utilizan técnicas de aprendizaje automático para la identificación de ofertas en subastas en línea.2. EBay y el Dell E193FP El tipo de subasta más común que se realiza en eBay es una subasta de proxy única. Las subastas se abren en un momento dado y permanecen abiertos por un período de tiempo establecido (generalmente una semana). Los postores ofertan por el artículo dando a un proxy un techo de valor. El poder ofertará en nombre del postor solo tanto como sea necesario para mantener una posición ganadora en la subasta, hasta el techo recibido del postor. Los postores pueden comunicarse con el poder varias veces antes de que se cierre una subasta. En el caso de que un poder de los postores haya sido superado, un postor puede darle al proxy un techo más alto para usar en la subasta.La subasta de poder de eBays implementa una versión incremental de una subasta de Vickrey, con el artículo vendido al mejor postor para la segunda oferta más alta más un pequeño incremento.181 10 0 10 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Número de subastas Número de subastas disponibles en las que BID Figura 1: Histograma del número de subastas LCD disponibles para cada licitador y número de subastas LCD enque participa un postor. El mercado analizado en este documento es el de un modelo específico de un monitor LCD, un modelo LCD de 19 Dell E193FP. Este mercado fue seleccionado por una variedad de razones que incluyen: • El precio medio del monitor fue de $ 240 (con desviación estándar $ 32), por lo que creemos que es razonable suponer que los licitadores en general solo están interesados en adquirir una copia del artículo eneBay.3 • El volumen realizado es bastante alto, a aproximadamente 500 unidades vendidas por mes.• El artículo no suele estar incluido con otros artículos.• El artículo generalmente se vende como nuevo y es adecuado para la coincidencia de precios del esquema basado en opciones. La información de subasta en bruto se adquirió a través de un script de Perl. El script accede al motor de búsqueda de eBay, 4 y devuelve todas las subastas que contienen los términos Dell y LCD que han cerrado en el último mes. 5 Los datos se almacenaron en un archivo de texto para el procesamiento posterior. Para aislar las subastas en el dominio de interés, las consultas se hicieron contra los títulos de las subastas de eBay que se cerraron entre el 27 de mayo de 2005 al 1 de octubre de 2005.6 La Figura 1 proporciona un sentido general de cuántas subastas de LCD ocurren mientras un postor está interesado en buscarun monitor.7 8,746 licitadores (86%) tenían más de una subasta disponible entre cuando hicieron una oferta por primera vez en eBay y los 3 como referencia, Dells Catálogo de pedidos por correo de octubre de 2005 cita el precio del monitor como de $ 379 sin una compra de escritorio, y $ 240 como parte de una actualización de compra de escritorio.4 http://search.ebay.com 5 La búsqueda no es sensible al caso.6 Específicamente, la consulta encontró todas las subastas donde el título contenía todas las siguientes cadenas: Dell, LCD y E193FP, al tiempo que excluyen todas las subastas que contenían cualquiera de las siguientes cuerdas: Dimensión, GHZ, Desktop, P4 y GB. Los términos de exclusión se incorporaron para que las únicas subastas analizadas fueran aquellas que venden exclusivamente la LCD de interés. Por ejemplo, se excluyen las pocas subastas agrupadas que venden un escritorio de dimensión Dell como la LCD E193FP están excluidas.7 Como referencia, la mayoría de las subastas se cierran en eBay entre el mediodía y la medianoche EDT, con casi dos subastas para el monitor Dell LCD cerrando cada hora en promedio durante los períodos de tiempo pico. Los postores tienen una paciencia promedio observada de 3.9 días (con una desviación estándar de 11.4 días).Último tiempo de cierre de una subasta en la que ofertan (con un promedio de 78 subastas disponibles). La Figura 1 también ilustra el número de subastas en las que participa cada postor. Solo se observa que el 32.3% de los postores que tenían más de una subasta disponible ofertan en más de una subasta (ofertas en 3.6 subastas en promedio). Un análisis de regresión simple muestra que los postores tienden a presentar ofertas máximas a una subasta que son $ 1.22 más altas después de pasar el doble de tiempo en el sistema, así como ofertas que son $ 0.27 más altas en cada subasta posterior. Entre los 508 postores que ganaron exactamente un monitor y participaron en múltiples subastas, 201 (40%) pagaron más de $ 10 más que el precio de cierre de otra subasta en la que ofertaron, pagando en promedio $ 35 más (desviación estándar $ 21) que el cierrePrecio de la subasta más barata en la que ofertaron pero no ganaron. Además, entre los 2,216 postores que nunca ganaron un artículo a pesar de participar en múltiples subastas, 421 (19%) colocaron una oferta perdedora en una subasta que era más de $ 10 más alto que el precio de cierre de otra subasta en la que ofertan, presentando una pérdida de pérdidaOferta en promedio $ 34 más (desviación estándar $ 23) que el precio de cierre de la subasta más barata en la que ofertaron pero no ganaron. Aunque estas medidas no dicen que un postor que Lost podría haber ganado definitivamente (porque solo consideramos el precio ganador final y no la oferta del ganador para su poder), o un postor que ganó podría haber asegurado un mejor precio, esto está enmenos indicativo de algunos errores de postor.3. Modelando el problema de la subasta secuencial Si bien el análisis de eBay fue para licitadores simples que desean solo un elemento, consideremos ahora un escenario más general en el que las personas pueden desear múltiples bienes de diferentes tipos, poseer valoraciones generales sobre esos bienes. Considere un mundo con compradores (a veces llamados postores) B y K diferentes tipos de bienes G1 ... GK. Deje t = {0, 1, ...} denota períodos de tiempo. Deje que L denote un paquete de bienes, representado como un vector de tamaño k, donde lk ∈ {0, 1} denota la cantidad de buen tipo GK en el paquete.8 El tipo de comprador i ∈ B es (ai, di,, di,, di,vi), con tiempo de llegada ai ∈ T, tiempo de salida di ∈ T, y valoración privada vi (l) ≥ 0 para cada paquete de bienes l recibidos entre AI y DI, y valor cero de lo contrario. La hora de llegada modela el período en el que un comprador se da cuenta de su demanda y ingresa al mercado, mientras que el tiempo de salida modela el período en el que un comprador pierde intereses en adquirir los bien (s). En la configuración con valoraciones generales, necesitamos una suposición adicional: un límite superior en la diferencia entre la llegada y la salida de los compradores, denotó Δmax. Los compradores tienen utilidades cuasi lineales, por lo que la utilidad del comprador que recibe el paquete l y pagando p, en algún período a más tardar, es ui (l, p) = vi (l)-p.Cada vendedor j ∈ S trae un solo artículo KJ al mercado, no tiene valor intrínseco y quiere maximizar los ingresos. El vendedor J tiene una hora de llegada, AJ, que modela el período en el que está interesada por primera vez en enumerar el artículo, mientras que la hora de salida, DJ, modela el último período en el que está dispuesta a considerar tener una subasta para el artículo cercano. Un vendedor recibirá el pago al final de la salida reportada del comprador ganador.8 Extendemos la notación por la cual un solo elemento k de tipo GK se refiere a un vector l: lk = 1. 182 decimos que una subasta individual en una secuencia es a prueba de estrategias localmente (LSP) si la oferta veraz es una estrategia dominante para un comprador que solo puedeoferta en esa subasta. Considere el siguiente ejemplo para ver que LSP es insuficiente para la existencia de una estrategia de licitación dominante para los compradores que enfrentan una secuencia de subastas. Ejemplo 1. Alice valora una tonelada de arena con una tonelada de piedra a $ 2, 000. Bob tiene una subasta de Vickrey por una tonelada de arena el lunes y una subasta de Vickrey por una tonelada de piedra el martes. Alice no tiene una estrategia de licitación dominante porque necesita saber el precio de Stone el martes para conocer su máxima disposición a pagar la arena el lunes. Definición 1. El problema de la subasta secuencial. Dada una secuencia de subastas, a pesar de que cada subasta es a prueba de estrategias localmente, un postor no tiene una estrategia de licitación dominante. Considere una secuencia de subastas. En general, las subastas que venden el mismo artículo serán ordenadas incertidamente, porque un comprador no sabrá el pedido de los precios de cierre entre las subastas. Defina los paquetes interesantes para un comprador como todos los paquetes que podrían maximizar la ganancia de los compradores para una combinación de subastas y ofertas de otros compradores.9 Dentro de los paquetes interesantes, digamos que un artículo tiene un valor marginal incierto si el valor marginal de un artículo depende delos otros bienes en poder del Comprador.10 Dicen que un artículo está excesivo si hay más de una subasta que ofrece un artículo de ese tipo. Digamos que dos paquetes son sustitutos si uno de esos paquetes tiene el mismo valor que la unión de ambos paquetes.11 Proposición 1. Dadas las subastas de elementos únicos a prueba de estrategias localmente, el problema de la subasta secuencial existe para un postor si y solo si alguna de las siguientes dos condiciones es verdadera: (1) Dentro del conjunto de paquetes interesantes (a) hay dos paquetes que son sustitutos (((b) Hay un elemento con valor marginal incierto, o (c) hay un elemento que se suplía demasiado;(2) Un postor enfrenta ofertas de competidores que están condicionadas a las ofertas anteriores de los licitantes. Prueba.(Sketch.) (⇐) Un postor no tiene una estrategia dominante cuando (a) no sabe qué paquete entre los sustitutos para perseguir, (b) enfrenta el problema de exposición, o (c) enfrenta el problema de copias múltiples. Además, un postor no tiene una estrategia dominante cuando no influye de manera óptima en las ofertas de los competidores.(⇒) Por contradicción. Un postor tiene una estrategia dominante para ofertar su valor marginal constante por un elemento determinado en cada subasta disponible cuando las condiciones (1) y (2) son falsas. Por ejemplo, los siguientes compradores enfrentan el problema de la subasta secuencial como resultado de la condición (a), (b) y (c) respectivamente: un comprador que valora una tonelada de arena por $ 1,000, o una tonelada de piedra por $ 2,000, perono tanto arena como piedra;Un comprador que valora una tonelada de arena por $ 1,000, una tonelada de piedra por $ 300 y una tonelada de arena y una tonelada de piedra por $ 1,500, y puede participar en una subasta para arena antes de una subasta para piedra;Un comprador que valora una tonelada de arena por $ 1,000 y puede participar en muchas subastas que venden arena.9 Suponga que el conjunto vacío es un paquete interesante.10 Formalmente, un ítem k tiene un valor marginal incierto si | {m: m = vi (q) - vi (q - k), ∀q ⊆ l ∈ InteresdeBundle, Q ⊇ k} |> 1. 11 Formalmente, dos paquetes A y B son sustitutos si vi (a ∪ b) = max (vi (a), vi (b)), donde a ∪ b = l donde lk = max (ak, bk).4. Super proxies y opciones La solución novedosa propuesta en este trabajo para resolver el problema de subasta secuencial consta de dos componentes principales: agentes proxy más ricos y opciones con coincidencia de precios. En finanzas, una opción real es un derecho a adquirir un bien realmente bueno a un precio determinado, llamado precio del ejercicio. Por ejemplo, Alice puede obtener de Bob el derecho a comprarle arena a un precio de ejercicio de $ 1, 000. Una opción proporciona el derecho de comprar un bien a un precio de ejercicio, pero no la obligación. Esta flexibilidad permite a los compradores reunir una colección de opciones sobre bienes y luego decidir cuál hacer ejercicio. Las opciones generalmente se venden a un precio llamado precio de opción. Sin embargo, las opciones obtenidas a un precio de opción distinto de cero generalmente no pueden admitir una estrategia de licitación simple y dominante, ya que un comprador debe calcular el valor esperado de una opción para justificar el costo [8]. Este cálculo requiere un modelo del futuro, que en nuestro entorno requiere un modelo de las estrategias de licitación y los valores de otros postores. Este es el tipo de razonamiento teórico del juego que queremos evitar. En cambio, consideramos opciones sin costo con un precio de opción de cero. Esto requerirá algo de cuidado ya que los compradores están débilmente mejor con una opción sin costo que sin una, sea cual sea su precio de ejercicio. Sin embargo, múltiples postores que buscan opciones sin intención de ejercerlos causarían la eficiencia de una subasta para que las opciones se desentragren. Este es el papel de los agentes proxy obligatorios, que intermedían entre los compradores y el mercado. Un agente proxy obliga a un enlace entre la función de valoración utilizada para adquirir opciones y la valoración utilizada para ejercer opciones. Si un comprador le dice a su poder un valor inflado para un artículo, corre el riesgo de tener las opciones de ejercicio de poder a un precio mayor que su valor.4.1 Proxies del comprador 4.1.1 Adquisición de opciones Después de su llegada, un comprador presenta su valoración ˆvi (quizás falsamente) a su poder en algún período ˆAi ≥ AI, junto con un reclamo sobre su tiempo de salida ˆdi ≥ ˆAi. Todas las transacciones son intermedias a través de agentes proxy. Cada subasta se modifica para vender una opción en ese bien a la oferta más alta de oferta, con un precio de ejercicio inicial establecido en la segunda oferta más alta recibida.12 Cuando una opción en la que un comprador está interesado está disponible por primera vez, el proxyDetermina su oferta calculando el valor marginal máximo de los compradores para el artículo, y luego presenta una oferta en este monto. Un proxy no oferta por un artículo cuando ya tiene una opción. El precio de la oferta es: bidt i (k) = max l [ˆvi (l + k) - ˆvi (l)] (1) haciendo que un proxy calcule un valor marginal máximo de los compradores para un artículo y luego oferte solo esa cantidad, unaProxy de compradores ganará cualquier subasta que pueda ser beneficiosa para el comprador y solo perderá esas subastas que nunca podrían ser de valor para el comprador.12 El sistema puede establecer un precio de reserva para cada bien, siempre que la reserva sea universal para todas las subastas que venden el mismo artículo. Sin un precio de reserva universal, la coincidencia de precios no es posible debido a las restricciones adicionales en los precios que los vendedores individuales aceptarán.183 Tipo de comprador Lunes martes Molly (lunes, martes, $ 8) 6nancy 6nancy → 4polly Nancy (lunes, martes, $ 6) -4polly Polly (lunes, martes, $ 4) -table 1: Ejemplo de tres compradores con cada uno con un solo artículo y un solo artículo yUna subasta que ocurre los lunes y martes. XY implica una opción con el precio de ejercicio X y la contabilidad de que un proxy ha impedido que Y posean actualmente una opción.→ Es la actualización del precio del ejercicio y la contabilidad. Cuando un proxy gana una subasta para una opción, el proxy almacenará en su memoria local la identidad (que puede ser un seudónimo) del proxy que no tiene una opción debido a la victoria de Proxys (es decir, el proxy que superó al ganar,Si alguna). Esta información se utilizará para la coincidencia de precios.4.1.2 Opciones de fijación de precios Los vendedores de los vendedores acuerdan unirse al mercado para permitir que el proxy represente a un comprador ajuste el precio de ejercicio de una opción que mantiene hacia abajo si el poder descubre que podría haber alcanzado un mejor precio al esperar para ofertar en una subasta posterior.para una opción en el mismo bien. Para ayudar en la implementación del esquema de coincidencia de precios, cada proxy rastrea las subastas futuras para una opción que ya ha ganado y determinará quién ofertaría en esa subasta si el proxy retrasara su entrada al mercado hasta esta subasta posterior. El proxy solicitará la coincidencia de precios del vendedor que le otorgó una opción si el proxy descubre que podría haber asegurado un precio más bajo esperando. Para reiterar, el proxy no adquiere más de una opción para ningún bien. Más bien, reduce el precio de ejercicio en su opción ya emitida si se encuentra un mejor trato. El poder puede descubrir estos acuerdos pidiendo a cada subasta futura que denuncie las identidades de los postores en esa subasta junto con sus ofertas. Ebay debe aplicar esto como la autoridad central. El mejor postor en esta subasta posterior, en aquellos cuya identidad no se almacena en la memoria Proxys para el elemento dado, es exactamente el postor contra quien el poder competiría si hubiera retrasado su entrada hasta esta subasta. Si esta oferta alta es más bajo que el precio de opción actual mantenido, el precio de poder coincide con este alto precio de oferta. Después de la coincidencia de precios, el proxy hará uno de los dos ajustes para fines de contabilidad. Si el ganador de la subasta es el postor cuya identidad ha estado en la memoria local de Proxys, el proxy reemplazará esa información local con la identidad del postor cuya oferta solo coincidía con el precio, ya que ese es el postor que el proxy ha impedidoobtener una opción. Si la identidad de los ganadores de la subasta no se almacena en la memoria local proxys, la memoria puede borrar. En este caso, el proxy simplemente coincidirá con las ofertas de las ofertas de futuros ganadores de la subasta en este artículo hasta que salga el poder. Ejemplo 2 (Tabla 1). El poder de Mollys gana la subasta del lunes, presentando una oferta de $ 8 y recibiendo una opción por $ 6. Mollys Proxy agrega a Nancy a su memoria local, ya que Nancys Proxy habría ganado si Mollys Proxy no fuera una oferta. El martes, solo la oferta proxy de Nancys y Pollys (como Mollys Proxy tiene una opción), con Nancys Proxy ganando un tipo de opbuyer la verdad del lunes martes: Molly (lunes, lunes, $ 8) 6nancynancy (lunes, martes, $ 6) - 4polly Polly (lun, Martes, $ 4) -MisReport: Molly (lunes, lunes, $ 8) -nancy (lunes, martes, $ 10) 8molly 8molly → 4φ Polly (lunes, martes, $ 4) -0φ Informa y coincidencia bajo: Molly (lunes, lunes, lunes, lunes,$ 8) -nancy (lunes, martes, $ 10) 8 8 → 0 Polly (lunes, martes, $ 4) - 0 Tabla 2: Ejemplos que demuestran por qué la contabilidad conducirá a un sistema veraz, mientras que simplemente coincidir con el precio ganador más bajo no lo hará.ción por $ 4 y señalando que golpeó el proxy de Pollys. En este momento, Mollys Proxy coincidirá con su opción hasta $ 4 y reemplazará a Nancy con Polly en su memoria local según el algoritmo de partido de precio, ya que Polly mantendría una opción si Molly nunca hubiera ofertado.4.1.3 Opciones de ejercicio en la hora de salida informada El poder elige qué opciones ejercer. Por lo tanto, un vendedor de una opción debe esperar hasta el período ˆDW para que la opción se ejerza y reciba el pago, donde W fue el ganador de la opción.13 para el postor i, en el período ˆdi, el proxy elige las opciones que maximizanLa utilidad (informada) del comprador: θ ∗ t = argmax θ⊆θ (ˆvi (γ (θ)) - π (θ)) (2) donde θ es el conjunto de todas las opciones mantenidas, γ (θ) son lasLos bienes correspondientes a un conjunto de opciones, y π (θ) es la suma de los precios del ejercicio para un conjunto de opciones. Se devuelven todas las demás opciones.14 No se ejercen opciones cuando ninguna combinación de opciones tiene utilidad positiva.4.1.4 ¿Por qué contabilidad y no coincidir con el precio ganador? Uno puede creer que un método alternativo para implementar un esquema de coincidencia de precios podría ser simplemente hacer que los representantes coincidan con el precio ganador más bajo que observan después de ganar una opción. Sin embargo, como se demostró en la Tabla 2, un esquema de coincidencia de precios tan simple no conducirá a un sistema veraz. El primer escenario en la Tabla 2 demuestra el resultado si todos los agentes informaran sinceramente sus tipos. Molly 13 Si bien esto parece restrictivo en el vendedor, creemos que no es significativamente diferente a lo que los vendedores en eBay actualmente perduran en la práctica. Una subasta en eBay se cierra en un momento específico, pero un vendedor debe esperar hasta que un comprador renuncie al pago antes de poder obtener los ingresos, una cantidad de tiempo que fácilmente podría ser días (si el pago es a través de un giro postal enviado a través de Courier) aMucho más largo (si un comprador es lento pero no abiertamente delincuente al remitir su pago).14 Presumiblemente, una opción devuelta dará como resultado que el vendedor tenga una nueva subasta para una opción en el artículo que aún posee. Sin embargo, el sistema no permitirá que un vendedor vuelva a supervisar una opción hasta que Δmax después de que la opción se haya emitido por primera vez para mantener un mecanismo sincero.184 ganaría la subasta del lunes y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 6 (posteriormente ejerciendo esa opción al final del lunes), y Nancy ganaría la subasta del martes y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 4 (posteriormente ejerciendo esa opciónal final del martes). El segundo escenario en la Tabla 2 demuestra el resultado si Nancy informara mal su valor para el bien al informar un valor inflado de $ 10, utilizando el método de contabilidad propuesto. Nancy ganaría la subasta del lunes y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 8. El martes, Polly ganaría la subasta y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 0. Nancys proxy observaría que la oferta más alta presentada el martes entre esos representantes no almacenados en la memoria local es la oferta de Pollys de $ 4, por lo que Nancys Proxy coincidiría con el precio del precio de ejercicio de su opción a $ 4. Tenga en cuenta que el precio de ejercicio que Nancys ha obtenido al final del martes es lo mismo que cuando reveló sinceramente su tipo a su poder. El tercer escenario en la Tabla 2 demuestra el resultado si Nancy informara mal su valor para el bien al informar un valor inflado de $ 10, si el esquema de coincidencia de precios fuera para que los representantes simplemente coincidieran con su precio de opción con el precio ganador más bajo en cualquier momento mientrasEstán en el sistema. Nancy ganaría la subasta del lunes y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 8. El martes, Polly ganaría la subasta y recibiría una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 0. Nancys proxy observaría que el precio más bajo el martes era de $ 0, por lo que Nancys Proxy coincidiría con el precio del precio de ejercicio de su opción a $ 0. Tenga en cuenta que el precio del precio de ejercicio que se ha obtenido al final del martes es más bajo que cuando reveló sinceramente su tipo al poder. Por lo tanto, una política de precio de precio de simplemente hacer coincidir el precio más bajo pagado puede no provocar información veraz de los compradores.4.2 Complejidad del algoritmo Una valuación XOR del tamaño M para el comprador I es un conjunto de términos m, <l1, v1 i> ... <lm, vm i>, que mapea paquetes distintos a los valores, donde estoy interesado en adquirirA lo sumo, uno de esos paquetes. Para cualquier paquete S, vi (s) = maxlm⊆s (VM I). Teorema 1. Dado una valuación XOR que posee m términos, hay un algoritmo O (km2) para calcular todos los valores marginales máximos, donde k es el número de diferentes tipos de artículos en los que un comprador puede estar interesado. Prueba. Para cada tipo de elemento, recupere la ecuación 1 que define el valor marginal máximo de un elemento. Para cada paquete L en la valoración M-término, VI (L + K) se puede encontrar iterando sobre los términos M. Por lo tanto, el número de términos explorados para determinar el valor marginal máximo para cualquier elemento es o (m2), por lo que el número total de comparaciones de paquetes que se realizarán para calcular todos los valores marginales máximos es o (km2). Teorema 2. La memoria total requerida por un proxy para implementar la coincidencia de precios es O (k), donde K es el número de tipos de elementos distintos. El trabajo total realizado por un proxy para realizar la coincidencia de precios en cada subasta es O (1). Prueba. Mediante la construcción del algoritmo, el proxy almacena un valor marginal máximo para cada elemento para la licitación, del cual hay o (k);A lo la mayoría, uno de los compradores de identidad para cada artículo, de los cuales hay O (k);y un precio de ejercicio de opción actual para cada artículo, de los cuales hay O (k). Para cada subasta, el proxy presenta una oferta precomputada o coincidencias de precios, las cuales toman O (1) trabajo.4.3 Pidiendo veraz a los representantes de los agentes proxy transforma el mercado en un mecanismo de revelación directa, donde cada comprador I interactúa con el poder solo una vez, 15 y lo hace declarando una oferta, BI, que se define como un anuncio de su tipo, (((ˆAi, ˆdi, ˆvi), donde el anuncio puede o no ser sincero. Denotamos todas las ofertas recibidas que no sean como B - I. Dadas ofertas, b = (bi, b - i), el mercado determina las asignaciones, xi (b) y pagos, pi (b) ≥ 0, a cada comprador (usando un algoritmo en línea). Un equilibrio de estrategia dominante para los compradores requiere que vi (xi (bi, b - i)) - pi (bi, b - i) ≥ vi (xi (bi, b - i)) - pi (bi, b - i),∀bi = bi, ∀b - i. Ahora establecemos que es una estrategia dominante para un comprador revelar su verdadera valoración y su verdadero tiempo de salida a su agente de poder inmediatamente al llegar al sistema. La prueba se basa en la caracterización basada en precios de las subastas en línea de un solo elemento a prueba de estrategias en Hajiaghayi et al.[12]. Defina una función de precio monotónica e independiente del valor PSI (AI, DI, L, V-I) que puede depender de los valores de otros agentes V-I. Price Psi (AI, DI, L, V - I) representará el precio disponible para el Agente I para el paquete L en el mecanismo si anuncia la hora de llegada AI y la hora de salida DI. El precio es independiente del valor VI del Agente I, pero puede depender de AI, DI y L siempre que satisfaga una condición de monotonicidad. Definición 2. La función de precio psi (ai, di, l, v - i) es monotónica si psi (ai, di, l, v - i) ≤ psi (ai, di, l, v - i) para todos ai ≤ ai, todos di≥ Di, todos los paquetes L ⊆ L y todos V - I. Lema 1. Una subasta combinatoria en línea será a prueba de estrategias (con informes veraces de llegada, salida y valor de una estrategia dominante) cuando existe una función de precio monotónica e independiente del valor, PSI (AI, DI, L, V-I), de modo que para todosI y todos los ai, di ∈ T y todos VI, el agente I se asigna el paquete l ∗ = argmaxl [vi (l) - psi (ai, di, l, v - i)] en el período di y realiza el pago psi (ai,di, l ∗, v - i). Prueba. Agente No puedo beneficiarme al informar una salida posterior ˆDI porque la asignación se realiza en el período ˆDI y el agente no tendría valor para esta asignación. Agente No puedo beneficiarme al informar una llegada posterior ˆAi ≥ Ai o la salida anterior ˆDi ≤ DI debido a la monotonicidad del precio. Finalmente, el agente no puede beneficiarse al informar algunos ˆVi = VI porque su valoración informada no cambia los precios que enfrenta y el mecanismo maximiza su utilidad dada su valoración reportada y dados los precios. Lema 2. En cualquier momento dado, hay como máximo un comprador en el sistema cuyo proxy no tiene una opción para un tipo de artículo dado debido al comprador es presencia en el sistema, y la identidad de ese comprador se almacenará en la memoria local de proxys enEsa vez si ese comprador existe. Prueba. Por inducción. Considere el primer proxy que un comprador evita ganar una opción. O (a) el 15 para fines de análisis, vemos el mecanismo como un mercado opaco para que el comprador no pueda condicionar su oferta por las ofertas impuestas por otros.185 El proxy superado dejará que el sistema nunca haya ganado una opción, o (b) el proxy superado ganará una subasta en el futuro. Si (a), la presencia de compradores impidió exactamente que un comprador ganara una opción, pero no habrá evitado que ningún otro proxy gane una opción (ya que el poder compradorEso aumentó la identidad de Proxys en su memoria local por definición del algoritmo. Si (b), el comprador no ha impedido que el proxy superado gane una opción después de todo, sino que ha evitado solo el proxy que perdió ante el proxy superado por ganar (si lo hay), cuya identidad ahora se almacenará en el Proxys LocalMemoria por definición del algoritmo. Para esta nueva identidad en la memoria local de los compradores proxys, el escenario (a) o (b) será cierto, ad infinitum. Dado esto, mostramos que la infraestructura basada en opciones implementa una subasta basada en precios con un programa de precios monotónico e independiente del valor para cada agente. Teorema 3. La revelación veraz de la valoración, la llegada y la partida es una estrategia dominante para un comprador en el mercado basado en opciones. Prueba. Primero, defina una función de precio simple independiente del agente PK I (T, V-I) como la oferta más alta por los proxies que no tienen una opción en un elemento de tipo GK en el momento T, sin incluir el proxy que representa y no incluyeCualquier proxy que ya hubiera ganado una opción si nunca hubiera ingresado al sistema (es decir, cuya identidad se almacena en la memoria local de los proxys) (∞ si no hay suministro en t). Este conjunto de proxies es independiente de cualquier declaración que haga a su proxy (ya que el conjunto excluye explícitamente el proxy como máximo (ver Lemma 2) que he impedido mantener una opción), y cada oferta presentada por un proxy dentro de este conjuntoes solo una función de sus propios compradores declaró la valoración (ver la ecuación 1). Además, no puedo influir en el suministro que enfrenta, ya que cualquier opción devuelta por los postores debido a un precio establecido por la oferta de PROXYS se volverá a subastarse después de que haya salido del sistema. Por lo tanto, PK I (T, V - I) es independiente de la declaración de su poder. A continuación, defina psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v - i) = minˆai≤τ≤ ˆdi [pk i (τ, v - i)] (posiblemente ∞) como el precio mínimo sobre pk i (t, v - i),que es claramente monotónico. Mediante la construcción de la coincidencia de precios, este es exactamente el precio obtenido por un proxy en cualquier opción que tenga en la salida. Define psi (ˆai, ˆdi, l, v - i) = èk = k k = 1 psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v - i) lk, que es monotónico en ˆai, ˆdi y l desde psk I (ˆai, ˆdi,, ˆdi,v - i) es monotónico en ˆAi y ˆDi y (débilmente) mayor que cero para cada k.Dado el conjunto de opciones mantenidas en ˆDI, que puede ser un subconjunto de esos artículos con precios no infinitos, las opciones de ejercicios de poder para maximizar la utilidad informada. La izquierda para mostrar es que todos los paquetes que no se pueden obtener con las opciones mantenidas tienen un precio suficientemente alto como para no ser preferidos. Para cada uno de estos paquetes, ya sea un elemento a un precio de ∞ (en cuyo caso no se desearía el paquete) o debe haber un elemento en ese paquete para el cual el proxy no tiene una opción disponible. En todas las subastas para dicho artículo, debe haber habido un postor distinto con una oferta mayor que bidt i (k), que posteriormente resulta en psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v - i)> bidt i (k), y así elEl paquete sin k sería preferir al paquete. Teorema 4. El esquema súper proxy basado en opciones es individualmente racional tanto para compradores como para vendedores.

Prueba. Por construcción, el poder ejerce el conjunto de opciones de maximización de ganancias obtenidas, o ninguna opción si ningún conjunto de opciones deriva el excedente no negativo. Por lo tanto, los compradores se garantizan el excedente no negativo al participar en el esquema. Para los vendedores, el precio de cada opción se basa en una oferta no negativa o cero.5. Evaluación de las opciones / infraestructura proxy Un objetivo de la evaluación comparativa empírica y una razón para recopilar datos de eBay es tratar de construir un modelo realista de compradores para estimar los ingresos del vendedor y otros efectos del mercado bajo el esquema basado en opciones. Simulamos una secuencia de subastas que coinciden con el momento de las subastas de Dell LCD en eBay.16 Cuando una subasta se cierra con éxito en eBay, simulamos una subasta de Vickrey para una opción en el elemento vendido en ese período. Las subastas que no cierran con éxito en eBay no se simulan. Estimamos la llegada, la salida y el valor de cada postor en eBay desde su comportamiento observado.17 La llegada se estima como la primera vez que un postor interactúa con el poder de eBay, mientras que la salida se estima como el último tiempo de cierre entre las subastas de eBay en las que un eBay.El postor participa. Inicialmente adoptamos una estimación particularmente conservadora para el valor del postor, estimando que se observó que la oferta más alta que un postor realizó en eBay. La Tabla 3 compara la distribución de los precios de cierre en eBay y en el esquema de opciones simuladas. Si bien el ingreso promedio en ambos esquemas es prácticamente el mismo ($ 239.66 en el esquema de opciones frente a $ 240.24 en eBay), los ganadores en el esquema de opciones tienden a valorar el artículo ganado 7% más que los ganadores en eBay ($ 263 en el esquema de opcionesvs. $ 244 en eBay).5.1 Identificación de ofertas Extendemos el trabajo de Haile y Tamer [11] a subastas secuenciales para obtener una mejor visión de los valores subyacentes del postor. En lugar de asumir para los postores un comportamiento de equilibrio como en las técnicas econométricas estándar, Haile y Tamer no intentan modelar cómo los valores verdaderos de los postores se asignan a una oferta en una subasta dada. Más bien, en el contexto de 16 repetidos al ejecutar las simulaciones, los resultados de los primeros y últimos diez días de subastas no se registran para reducir los efectos de borde que provienen de ver una ventana de tiempo discreta de un proceso continuo.17 Para los 100 postores que ganaron varias veces en eBay, cada uno solicitamos un valor marginal constante para cada artículo adicional en cada subasta hasta que el número de opciones mantenidas sea igual al número total de LCD ganados en eBay, con cada opción disponible por preciocoincidir de forma independiente. Esta estrategia de licitación no es una estrategia dominante (que cae fuera del espacio de tipo posible para los compradores en el que se ha construido la prueba de veracidad), pero se cree que es la acción de primer orden más apropiada para la simulación.186 0 100 2003 300 400 500 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Valor ($) CDF Observó ofertas máximas de valor superior del valor verdadero Figura 2: CDF de las ofertas máximas observadas y la estimación superior de la distribución de poblaciones de licitaciones para la máxima disposición a pagar. La verdadera distribución de la población se encuentra debajo del límite superior estimado.Las subastas de un solo elemento con poblaciones de postor distintas, Haile y Tamer hacen solo los siguientes dos supuestos al estimar la distribución de los valores verdaderos de los postor: 1. Los postores no ofertan más de lo que están dispuestos a pagar.2. Los postores no permiten que un oponente gane a un precio que estén dispuestos a vencer. Desde el primero de sus dos supuestos, dadas las ofertas impuestas por cada postor en cada subasta, Haile y Tamer derivan un método para estimar un límite superior de las poblaciones de licitación Distribución de valor real (es decir, el límite que se encuentra por encima de la distribución de valor real). A partir del segundo de sus dos supuestos, dado el precio ganador de cada subasta, Haile y Tamer obtienen un método para estimar un límite inferior de las poblaciones de licitación de la distribución del valor real. Es solo la parte superior de la distribución que utilizamos en nuestro trabajo. Haile y Tamer suponen que los postores solo participan en una sola subasta y requieren la independencia de la población de licitación de una subasta a la subasta. Ninguna de las suposiciones es válida aquí: el primero porque se sabe que los postores ofertan en más de una subasta, y el segundo porque el conjunto de postores en una subasta es, con toda probabilidad, no un verdadero I.I.D.Muestreo de la población general de licitación. En particular, aquellos que ganan subastas tienen menos probabilidades de ofertar en subastas sucesivas, mientras que aquellos que pierden subastas tienen más probabilidades de seguir siendo postores en futuras subastas. Al aplicar sus métodos, realizamos los siguientes ajustes: • Dentro de una subasta determinada, los licitadores individuales realizan la verdadera voluntad de pagar se supone débilmente mayor que la oferta máxima que el licitador presenta todas las subastas para ese artículo (ya sea pasado o futuro).• Al estimar el límite superior de la distribución del valor, si un postor ofrece en más de una subasta, seleccione aleatoriamente una de las subastas en las que el postor oferta y solo utiliza esa observación durante la estimación.18 18 En el trabajo actual, nosotros, nosotros, nosotrosSuponga que eliminar los postores duplicados es suficiente para que las poblaciones de compras sean independientes I.I.D.se basa en una subasta a la subasta. Si se cree que ciertas partes de la población se sienten atraídas para el valor de Cerprice σ (precio) excedente eBay $ 240.24 $ 32 $ 281 $ 40 Opciones $ 275.80 $ 14 $ 302 $ 26 Tabla 4: Precio promedio pagado, desviación estándar de los precios pagados, valor promedio de los ganadores entre los ganadores y promedio y promedio de ganadores y promedio y promedioEl excedente ganador del postor en eBay para las pantallas LCD Dell E193FP, así como en el mercado basado en opciones simuladas, utilizando una estimación de Haile y Tamer ajustado de los valores verdaderos de los licitadores que son un 15% más altos que su oferta máxima observada. La Figura 2 proporciona la distribución de las ofertas máximas impuestas por los licitadores en eBay, así como el límite superior estimado del valor verdadero de la distribución de los licitadores en función del método extendido de Haile y Tamer.19 Como se puede ver, la brecha relativa más pequeña entre las dos curvasSe produce significativamente cerca del percentil 80, donde el límite superior es 1.17 veces la oferta máxima. Por lo tanto, adoptado como un modelo menos conservador de los valores de los postor es un factor de escala uniforme de 1.15. Ahora presentamos los resultados de este análisis menos conservador. La Tabla 4 muestra la distribución de los precios de cierre en las subastas en eBay y en el esquema de opciones simuladas. El precio medio en el esquema de opciones ahora es significativamente mayor, 15% mayor que los precios en eBay ($ 276 en el esquema de opciones frente a $ 240 en eBay), mientras que la desviación estándar de los precios de cierre es menor entre las subastas del esquema de opciones ($ 14en el esquema de opciones vs. $ 32 en eBay). Por lo tanto, no solo es el flujo de ingresos esperado más alto, sino que la varianza más baja proporciona a los vendedores una mayor probabilidad de obtener un ingreso más alto. La eficiencia del esquema de opciones sigue siendo más alta que en eBay. Los ganadores en el esquema de opciones ahora tienen un valor estimado promedio un 7,5% más alto en $ 302. En un esfuerzo por comprender mejor esta eficiencia, formulamos un programa entero mixto (MIP) para determinar una estimación simple de la eficiencia de asignación de eBay. The MIP computes the efficient value of the oﬄine problem with full hindsight on all bids and all supply.20 Using a scaling of 1.15, the total value allocated to eBay winners is estimated at $551,242, while the optimal value (from the MIP) is $593,301. Esto sugiere una eficiencia de asignación de 92.9%: si bien el valor típico de un ganador en eBay es de $ 281, fue posible un valor promedio de $ 303.21 Tenga en cuenta las subastas de TAIN basadas en opciones, entonces se requerirían ajustes adicionales para utilizar estas técnicas.19 La estimación de los puntos en la curva es una minimización en muchas variables, muchas de las cuales pueden tener sesgo de pequeños y numbers. En consecuencia, Haile y Tamer sugieren usar un promedio ponderado en todos los términos yi de è i yi exp (yiρ) èj exp (yj ρ) para aproximar el mínimo mientras reduce los efectos numéricos pequeños. Usamos ρ = −1000 y eliminamos las observaciones de subastas con 17 postores o más, ya que ocurrieron con mucha frecuencia. Sin embargo, algunos sesgos de números pequeños todavía se demostraron con la meseta en nuestra estimación de límite superior alrededor de un valor de $ 300.20 compradores que ganaron más de un artículo en eBay están clonados para que parezcan ser múltiples postores de tipo idéntico.21 Mientras se crea que el verdadero valor de cada licitador es un factor constante α de su oferta máxima observada, el cálculo de eficiencia del 92.9% es válido para cualquier valor de α. En la práctica, esta creencia puede no ser razonable. Por ejemplo, si los postores perdedores tienden a tener valores verdaderos cercanos a su esquema observado 187, muy cerca de lograr este nivel de eficiencia [con un 99.7% eficiente en esta estimación] a pesar de que opera sin el beneficio de la retrospectiva. Finalmente, aunque el excedente típico de postor ganadores disminuye entre eBay y el esquema basado en opciones, sería posible alguna redistribución excedente porque la eficiencia total del mercado mejoró.22 6. Discusión La mayor preocupación con nuestro esquema es que los agentes proxy que pueden estar interesados en muchos artículos diferentes pueden adquirir muchas más opciones de las que finalmente ejercen. Esto puede conducir a una pérdida de eficiencia. Observe que este no es un problema cuando los postores solo están interesados en un solo elemento (como en nuestro estudio empírico), o tienen valores lineales aditivos en los elementos. Para solucionar esto, preferiríamos que los agentes proxy usen más precaución para adquirir opciones y usar una estrategia de licitación más adaptativa que la de la Ecuación 1. Por ejemplo, si un proxy ya tiene una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 3 en algún artículo para el cual tiene un valor de $ 10, y valora algún artículo sustituto a $ 5, el proxy podría razonar que en ninguna circunstancia será útilAdquirir una opción en el segundo elemento. Formulamos una estrategia de licitación más sofisticada en este sentido. Sea θt el conjunto de todas las opciones un proxy para el postor que ya poseo en el momento t.Sea θt ⊆ θt, sea un subconjunto de esas opciones, la suma de cuyos precios de ejercicio son π (θt), y los bienes correspondientes a esas opciones son γ (θt). Sea π (θt) = ˆvi (γ (θt)) - π (θt) sea el excedente (informado) disponible asociado con un conjunto de opciones. Sea θ ∗ t el conjunto de opciones que se mantienen actualmente que maximizarían el excedente de los compradores;es decir, θ ∗ t = argmaxθt⊆θt π (θt). Deje que la disposición máxima de pagar por un artículo K represente un precio por encima del cual el agente sabe que nunca ejercería una opción en el artículo dadas las opciones actuales mantenidas. Esto se puede calcular de la siguiente manera: bidt i (k) = max l [0, min [ˆvi (l + k) - π (θ ∗ t), ˆvi (l + k) - ˆvi (l)]] (3)donde ˆvi (l+ k) −π (θ ∗ t) considera el excedente ya retenido, ˆVi (l+ k) −ˆvi (l) considera el valor marginal de un bien y tomando el máximo [0 ,.] considera el uso generalde perseguir el bien. Sin embargo, y algo contrario, no podemos implementar este esquema de licitación sin perder la veracidad. El término π (θ ∗ t) en la ecuación 3 (es decir, el monto del excedente garantizado que ya ha obtenido) puede verse influenciado por la oferta proxy js. Por lo tanto, el postor J puede tener el incentivo de tergiversar su valoración a su poder si ella cree que hacerlo hará que yo oferte de manera diferente en el futuro de una manera beneficiosa para j. Considere el siguiente ejemplo donde el esquema de poder se refina para ofertar la máxima disposición a pagar. Ejemplo 3. Alice valora una tonelada de arena o una tonelada de piedra por $ 2,000. Bob valora una tonelada de arena o una tonelada de piedra por $ 1,500. Todos los licitadores tienen ofertas máximas de paciencia, mientras que los ganadores de eBay tienen valores verdaderos mucho mayores que sus ofertas máximas observadas y luego se introduce un sesgo descendente en el cálculo de la eficiencia en la actualidad.22 El aumento en el excedente del ganador de eBay entre las Tablas 3 y 4 es de esperar ya que la escalada α aumenta estrictamente el valor estimado de los ganadores de eBay mientras mantiene los precios a los que ganaron constante.de 2 días. En el primer día, se realiza una subasta de arena, donde Alices proxy ofrece $ 2,000 y Bobs oferta $ 1,500. Alices proxy gana una opción para comprar arena por $ 1,500. En el segundo día, se celebra una subasta de piedra, donde Alices proxy oferta $ 1,500 [ya que ya ha obtenido $ 500 garantizados de excedentes al ganar una opción de arena, por lo que reduce su oferta de piedra por esta cantidad], y Bobs ofrece $ 1,500. El Proxy de Alices o Bobs Proxy ganará la opción de piedra. Al final del segundo día, Alices Proxy posee una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 1,500 para obtener un buen valor de $ 2,000, por lo que obtiene $ 500 en excedente. Ahora, considere lo que habría sucedido si Alice hubiera declarado que solo valoraba la piedra. Ejemplo 4. Alice declara valorando solo la piedra por $ 2,000. Bob valora una tonelada de arena o una tonelada de piedra por $ 1,500. Todos los postores tienen paciencia de 2 días. El primer día, se realiza una subasta de arena, donde Bobs Proxy ofrece $ 1,500. Bobs Proxy gana una opción para comprar arena por $ 0. En el día dos, se celebra una subasta de piedra, donde Alices proxy oferta $ 2,000, y Bobs oferta $ 0 [ya que ya ha obtenido $ 1,500 de excedentes al ganar una opción de arena, y así reduce su oferta de piedra por esta cantidad]. Alices proxy gana la opción de piedra por $ 0. Al final del segundo día, Alices Proxy posee una opción con un precio de ejercicio de $ 0 para obtener un buen valor de $ 2,000, por lo que obtiene $ 2,000 en excedente. Al tergiversar su valoración (es decir, excluyendo su valor de arena), Alice pudo asegurar un superávit más alto al guiar a Bobs ofertas de piedra a $ 0. Un área de trabajo inmediato de los autores es desarrollar un agente proxy más sofisticado que pueda permitir la licitación de la máxima voluntad de pagar (Ecuación 3) mientras mantiene la veracidad. Una preocupación adicional, práctica, con nuestro esquema de poder es que asumimos un método disponible, confiable y bien entendido para caracterizar los bienes (y presumiblemente la calidad de los bienes). Imaginamos que esto sucede en la práctica por parte de los vendedores que definen una clasificación para su artículo al ingresar al mercado, por ejemplo, a través de un código UPC. Al igual que en eBay, esto permitiría una oportunidad para que los vendedores mejoren los ingresos exagerando la calidad de su artículo (nuevo frente a nuevo), y plantea el tema de qué tan bien un esquema de reputación podría abordar esto.7. Conclusiones Introdujimos un nuevo canal de ventas, que consiste en un protocolo de subastas basado en opciones y representaciones, para abordar el problema de subasta secuencial que existe cuando los postores enfrentan múltiples subastas para sustitutos y complementos de bienes. Nuestro esquema proporciona a los postores una estrategia de licitación simple, dominante y veraz a pesar de que el mercado permanece abierto y dinámico. Además de explorar representantes más sofisticados que ofertan en términos de máxima disposición a pagar, el trabajo futuro debería apuntar a modelar mejor los incentivos del vendedor y resolver los problemas estratégicos que enfrentan los vendedores. Por ejemplo, ¿el esquema de opciones cambia los incentivos del vendedor de lo que están actualmente en eBay? Agradecimientos Nos gustaría agradecer a Pai-Ling Yin.

        "This set of proxies is independent of any declaration i makes to its proxy (as the set explicitly excludes the at most one proxy (see Lemma 2) that i has prevented from holding an option), and each bid submitted by a proxy within this set is only a function of their own buyers declared valuation (see Equation 1).",
        "Furthermore, i cannot influence the supply she faces as any options returned by bidders due to a price set by is proxys bid will be re-auctioned after i has departed the system.",
        "Therefore, pk i (t, v−i) is independent of is declaration to its proxy.",
        "Next, define psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) = minˆai≤τ≤ ˆdi [pk i (τ, v−i)] (possibly ∞) as the minimum price over pk i (t, v−i), which is clearly monotonic.",
        "By construction of price matching, this is exactly the price obtained by a proxy on any option that it holds at departure.",
        "Define psi(ˆai, ˆdi, L, v−i) = Èk=K k=1 psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i)Lk, which is monotonic in ˆai, ˆdi and L since psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) is monotonic in ˆai and ˆdi and (weakly) greater than zero for each k. Given the set of options held at ˆdi, which may be a subset of those items with non-infinite prices, the proxy exercises options to maximize the reported utility.",
        "Left to show is that all bundles that could not be obtained with options held are priced sufficiently high as to not be preferred.",
        "For each such bundle, either there is an item priced at ∞ (in which case the bundle would not be desired) or there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy does not hold an option that was available.",
        "In all auctions for such an item there must have been a distinct bidder with a bid greater than bidt i(k), which subsequently results in psk i (ˆai, ˆdi, v−i) > bidt i(k), and so the bundle without k would be preferred to the bundle.",

        "Proof.",
        "By construction, the proxy exercises the profit maximizing set of options obtained, or no options if no set of options derives non-negative surplus.",
        "Therefore, buyers are guaranteed non-negative surplus by participating in the scheme.",
        "For sellers, the price of each option is based on a non-negative bid or zero. 5.",
        "EVALUATING THE OPTIONS / PROXY INFRASTRUCTURE A goal of the empirical benchmarking and a reason to collect data from eBay is to try and build a realistic model of buyers from which to estimate seller revenue and other market effects under the options-based scheme.",
        "We simulate a sequence of auctions that match the timing of the Dell LCD auctions on eBay.16 When an auction successfully closes on eBay, we simulate a Vickrey auction for an option on the item sold in that period.",
        "Auctions that do not successfully close on eBay are not simulated.",
        "We estimate the arrival, departure and value of each bidder on eBay from their observed behavior.17 Arrival is estimated as the first time that a bidder interacts with the eBay proxy, while departure is estimated as the latest closing time among eBay auctions in which a bidder participates.",
        "We initially adopt a particularly conservative estimate for bidder value, estimating it as the highest bid a bidder was observed to make on eBay.",
        "Table 3 compares the distribution of closing prices on eBay and in the simulated options scheme.",
        "While the average revenue in both schemes is virtually the same ($239.66 in the options scheme vs. $240.24 on eBay), the winners in the options scheme tend to value the item won 7% more than the winners on eBay ($263 in the options scheme vs. $244 on eBay). 5.1 Bid Identification We extend the work of Haile and Tamer [11] to sequential auctions to get a better view of underlying bidder values.",
        "Rather than assume for bidders an equilibrium behavior as in standard econometric techniques, Haile and Tamer do not attempt to model how bidders true values get mapped into a bid in any given auction.",
        "Rather, in the context of repeated 16 When running the simulations, the results of the first and final ten days of auctions are not recorded to reduce edge effects that come from viewing a discrete time window of a continuous process. 17 For the 100 bidders that won multiple times on eBay, we have each one bid a constant marginal value for each additional item in each auction until the number of options held equals the total number of LCDs won on eBay, with each option available for price matching independently.",
        "This bidding strategy is not a dominant strategy (falling outside the type space possible for buyers on which the proof of truthfulness has been built), but is believed to be the most appropriate first order action for simulation. 186 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Value ($) CDF Observed Max Bids Upper Bound of True Value Figure 2: CDF of maximum bids observed and upper bound estimate of the bidding populations distribution for maximum willingness to pay.",
        "The true population distribution lies below the estimated upper bound. single-item auctions with distinct bidder populations, Haile and Tamer make only the following two assumptions when estimating the distribution of true bidder values: 1.",
        "Bidders do not bid more than they are willing to pay. 2.",
        "Bidders do not allow an opponent to win at a price they are willing to beat.",
        "From the first of their two assumptions, given the bids placed by each bidder in each auction, Haile and Tamer derive a method for estimating an upper bound of the bidding populations true value distribution (i.e., the bound that lies above the true value distribution).",
        "From the second of their two assumptions, given the winning price of each auction, Haile and Tamer derive a method for estimating a lower bound of the bidding populations true value distribution.",
        "It is only the upper-bound of the distribution that we utilize in our work.",
        "Haile and Tamer assume that bidders only participate in a single auction, and require independence of the bidding population from auction to auction.",
        "Neither assumption is valid here: the former because bidders are known to bid in more than one auction, and the latter because the set of bidders in an auction is in all likelihood not a true i.i.d. sampling of the overall bidding population.",
        "In particular, those who win auctions are less likely to bid in successive auctions, while those who lose auctions are more likely to remain bidders in future auctions.",
        "In applying their methods we make the following adjustments: • Within a given auction, each individual bidders true willingness to pay is assumed weakly greater than the maximum bid that bidder submits across all auctions for that item (either past or future). • When estimating the upper bound of the value distribution, if a bidder bids in more than one auction, randomly select one of the auctions in which the bidder bid, and only utilize that one observation during the estimation.18 18 In current work, we assume that removing duplicate bidders is sufficient to make the buying populations independent i.i.d. draws from auction to auction.",

        "Figure 2 provides the distribution of maximum bids placed by bidders on eBay as well as the estimated upper bound of the true value distribution of bidders based on the extended Haile and Tamer method.19 As can be seen, the smallest relative gap between the two curves meaningfully occurs near the 80th percentile, where the upper bound is 1.17 times the maximum bid.",
        "Therefore, adopted as a less conservative model of bidder values is a uniform scaling factor of 1.15.",
        "We now present results from this less conservative analysis.",
        "Table 4 shows the distribution of closing prices in auctions on eBay and in the simulated options scheme.",
        "The mean price in the options scheme is now significantly higher, 15% greater, than the prices on eBay ($276 in the options scheme vs. $240 on eBay), while the standard deviation of closing prices is lower among the options scheme auctions ($14 in the options scheme vs. $32 on eBay).",
        "Therefore, not only is the expected revenue stream higher, but the lower variance provides sellers a greater likelihood of realizing that higher revenue.",
        "The efficiency of the options scheme remains higher than on eBay.",
        "The winners in the options scheme now have an average estimated value 7.5% higher at $302.",
        "In an effort to better understand this efficiency, we formulated a mixed integer program (MIP) to determine a simple estimate of the allocative efficiency of eBay.",
        "The MIP computes the efficient value of the oﬄine problem with full hindsight on all bids and all supply.20 Using a scaling of 1.15, the total value allocated to eBay winners is estimated at $551,242, while the optimal value (from the MIP) is $593,301.",
        "This suggests an allocative efficiency of 92.9%: while the typical value of a winner on eBay is $281, an average value of $303 was possible.21 Note the options-based tain auctions, then further adjustments would be required in order to utilize these techniques. 19 The estimation of the points in the curve is a minimization over many variables, many of which can have smallnumbers bias.",
        "Consequently, Haile and Tamer suggest using a weighted average over all terms yi of È i yi exp(yiρ)Èj exp(yj ρ) to approximate the minimum while reducing the small number effects.",
        "We used ρ = −1000 and removed observations of auctions with 17 bidders or more as they occurred very infrequently.",
        "However, some small numbers bias still demonstrated itself with the plateau in our upper bound estimate around a value of $300. 20 Buyers who won more than one item on eBay are cloned so that they appear to be multiple bidders of identical type. 21 As long as one believes that every bidders true value is a constant factor α away from their observed maximum bid, the 92.9% efficiency calculation holds for any value of α.",
        "In practice, this belief may not be reasonable.",
        "For example, if losing bidders tend to have true values close to their observed 187 scheme comes very close to achieving this level of efficiency [at 99.7% efficient in this estimate] even though it operates without the benefit of hindsight.",
        "Finally, although the typical winning bidder surplus decreases between eBay and the options-based scheme, some surplus redistribution would be possible because the total market efficiency is improved.22 6.",
        "DISCUSSION The biggest concern with our scheme is that proxy agents who may be interested in many different items may acquire many more options than they finally exercise.",
        "This can lead to efficiency loss.",
        "Notice that this is not an issue when bidders are only interested in a single item (as in our empirical study), or have linear-additive values on items.",
        "To fix this, we would prefer to have proxy agents use more caution in acquiring options and use a more adaptive bidding strategy than that in Equation 1.",
        "For instance, if a proxy is already holding an option with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the second item.",
        "We formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along these lines.",
        "Let Θt be the set of all options a proxy for bidder i already possesses at time t. Let θt ⊆ Θt, be a subset of those options, the sum of whose exercise prices are π(θt), and the goods corresponding to those options being γ(θt).",
        "Let Π(θt) = ˆvi(γ(θt)) − π(θt) be the (reported) available surplus associated with a set of options.",
        "Let θ∗ t be the set of options currently held that would maximize the buyers surplus; i.e., θ∗ t = argmaxθt⊆Θt Π(θt).",
        "Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an option on the item given the current options held.",
        "This can be computed as follows: bidt i(k) = max L [0, min[ˆvi(L + k) − Π(θ∗ t ), ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)]] (3) where ˆvi(L+k)−Π(θ∗ t ) considers surplus already held, ˆvi(L+ k)−ˆvi(L) considers the marginal value of a good, and taking the max[0, .] considers the overall use of pursuing the good.",
        "However, and somewhat counter intuitively, we are not able to implement this bidding scheme without forfeiting truthfulness.",
        "The Π(θ∗ t ) term in Equation 3 (i.e., the amount of guaranteed surplus bidder i has already obtained) can be influenced by proxy js bid.",
        "Therefore, bidder j may have the incentive to misrepresent her valuation to her proxy if she believes doing so will cause i to bid differently in the future in a manner beneficial to j.",

        "An additional, practical, concern with our proxy scheme is that we assume an available, trusted, and well understood method to characterize goods (and presumably the quality of goods).",
        "We envision this happening in practice by sellers defining a classification for their item upon entering the market, for instance via a UPC code.",
        "Just as in eBay, this would allow an opportunity for sellers to improve revenue by overstating the quality of their item (new vs. like new), and raises the issue of how well a reputation scheme could address this. 7.",

                "Figure 2 provides the distribution of maximum bids placed by bidders on eBay as well as the estimated upper bound of the true value distribution of bidders based on the extended Haile and Tamer method.19 As can be seen, the smallest relative gap between the two curves meaningfully occurs near the 80th percentile, where the upper bound is 1.17 times the maximum bid.",
                "Therefore, adopted as a less conservative model of bidder values is a uniform scaling factor of 1.15.",

                "This suggests an allocative efficiency of 92.9%: while the typical value of a winner on eBay is $281, an average value of $303 was possible.21 Note the options-based tain auctions, then further adjustments would be required in order to utilize these techniques. 19 The estimation of the points in the curve is a minimization over many variables, many of which can have smallnumbers bias.",

                "For example, if losing bidders tend to have true values close to their observed 187 scheme comes very close to achieving this level of efficiency [at 99.7% efficient in this estimate] even though it operates without the benefit of hindsight.",

                "For instance, if a proxy is already holding an option with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an option on the second item.",

                "Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an option on the item given the current options held.",
                "This can be computed as follows: bidt i(k) = max L [0, min[ˆvi(L + k) − Π(θ∗ t ), ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)]] (3) where ˆvi(L+k)−Π(θ∗ t ) considers surplus already held, ˆvi(L+ k)−ˆvi(L) considers the marginal value of a good, and taking the max[0, .] considers the overall use of pursuing the good.",

                "Among the 508 bidders that won exactly one monitor and participated in multiple auctions, 201 (40%) paid more than $10 more than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, paying on average $35 more (standard deviation $21) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.",
                "Furthermore, among the 2,216 bidders that never won an item despite participating in multiple auctions, 421 (19%) placed a losing bid in one auction that was more than $10 higher than the closing price of another auction in which they bid, submitting a losing bid on average $34 more (standard deviation $23) than the closing price of the cheapest auction in which they bid but did not win.",
                "Although these measures do not say a bidder that lost could have definitively won (because we only consider the final winning price and not the bid of the winner to her proxy), or a bidder that won could have secured a better price, this is at least indicative of some bidder mistakes. 3.",

                "This set of proxies is independent of any declaration i makes to its proxy (as the set explicitly excludes the at most one proxy (see Lemma 2) that i has prevented from holding an option), and each bid submitted by a proxy within this set is only a function of their own buyers declared valuation (see Equation 1).",
                "Furthermore, i cannot influence the supply she faces as any options returned by bidders due to a price set by is proxys bid will be re-auctioned after i has departed the system.",

Given the set of options held at ˆdi, which may be a subset of those items with non-infinite prices, the proxy exercises options to maximize the reported utility.",
                "Left to show is that all bundles that could not be obtained with options held are priced sufficiently high as to not be preferred.",
                "For each such bundle, either there is an item priced at ∞ (in which case the bundle would not be desired) or there must be an item in that bundle for which the proxy does not hold an option that was available.",

                "The winners in the options scheme now have an average estimated value 7.5% higher at $302.",
                "In an effort to better understand this efficiency, we formulated a mixed integer program (MIP) to determine a simple estimate of the allocative efficiency of eBay.",
                "The MIP computes the efficient value of the oﬄine problem with full hindsight on all bids and all supply.20 Using a scaling of 1.15, the total value allocated to eBay winners is estimated at $551,242, while the optimal value (from the MIP) is $593,301.",
                "This suggests an allocative efficiency of 92.9%: while the typical value of a winner on eBay is $281, an average value of $303 was possible.21 Note the options-based tain auctions, then further adjustments would be required in order to utilize these techniques. 19 The estimation of the points in the curve is a minimization over many variables, many of which can have smallnumbers bias.",

                "However, some small numbers bias still demonstrated itself with the plateau in our upper bound estimate around a value of $300. 20 Buyers who won more than one item on eBay are cloned so that they appear to be multiple bidders of identical type. 21 As long as one believes that every bidders true value is a constant factor α away from their observed maximum bid, the 92.9% efficiency calculation holds for any value of α.",
                "In practice, this belief may not be reasonable.",
                "For example, if losing bidders tend to have true values close to their observed 187 scheme comes very close to achieving this level of efficiency [at 99.7% efficient in this estimate] even though it operates without the benefit of hindsight.",
                "Finally, although the typical winning bidder surplus decreases between eBay and the options-based scheme, some surplus redistribution would be possible because the total market efficiency is improved.22 6.",
                "DISCUSSION The biggest concern with our scheme is that proxy agents who may be interested in many different items may acquire many more options than they finally exercise.",
                "This can lead to efficiency loss.",
                "Notice that this is not an issue when bidders are only interested in a single item (as in our empirical study), or have linear-additive values on items.",

                "For instance, if a proxy is already holding an <br>option</br> with an exercise price of $3 on some item for which it has value of $10, and it values some substitute item at $5, the proxy could reason that in no circumstance will it be useful to acquire an <br>option</br> on the second item.",
                "We formulate a more sophisticated bidding strategy along these lines.",
                "Let Θt be the set of all options a proxy for bidder i already possesses at time t. Let θt ⊆ Θt, be a subset of those options, the sum of whose exercise prices are π(θt), and the goods corresponding to those options being γ(θt).",

                "Let the maximal willingness to pay for an item k represent a price above which the agent knows it would never exercise an <br>option</br> on the item given the current options held.",
                "This can be computed as follows: bidt i(k) = max L [0, min[ˆvi(L + k) − Π(θ∗ t ), ˆvi(L + k) − ˆvi(L)]] (3) where ˆvi(L+k)−Π(θ∗ t ) considers surplus already held, ˆvi(L+ k)−ˆvi(L) considers the marginal value of a good, and taking the max[0, .] considers the overall use of pursuing the good.",
                "However, and somewhat counter intuitively, we are not able to implement this bidding scheme without forfeiting truthfulness.",
