The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder. In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid. In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating. These results provide insights into sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.

INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly. Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined. However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears. The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome. At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer. However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server. In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids. We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used. Note that two of these cases are trivial. In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder. In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully. This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail. A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid. This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction. For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity. We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats. However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat). We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat. Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions. In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidders value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability). This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the endpoints of a spectrum of auctions. But why should the seller have all the fun? In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins. To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win. Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction. In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders. When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder. This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating. We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the case of a seller cheating in a second price auction. Section 3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction. In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings. We discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6. All proofs and derivations are found in the appendix. 2. SECOND-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING SELLER In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after observing all of the bids. The formulation for this section will be largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating in a first-price auction. While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller. Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1]. Call the probability density function (pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf. Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents. A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i. We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i). We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i). Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i). An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation. Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium. We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent. On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power. Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise. The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise. The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats. By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers. Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed. Formally, b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if: ∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗ i (θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi ≥ Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi (4) 2.2 Equilibrium We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary distribution F(·). 4 This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins. 5 Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium. 77 Theorem 1. In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc . Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]). In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined. However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction. The position of Pc is perhaps surprising. For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions. Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid. By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction. Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types. We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi. Corollary 2. In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results. When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3. FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears). Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction. After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·). This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents. This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction. Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction. It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat. One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid. However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating. Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type. This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction. In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined. With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid. These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid. Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents. Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction. It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph. The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy. Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it. Theorem 3. In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·). A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi. Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy. Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid. The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance. However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged. Corollary 4. In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type. In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy. Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type. Theorem 5. In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0. The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy. This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate. However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium. It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid. In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions. It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer. However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less. In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type. However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations. Example 1. In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium. We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ). It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise. Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 . It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·). Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it). We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4. REVENUE LOSS FOR AN HONEST SELLER In both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating. The equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us to quantify this loss. Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction. In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave their bids. For the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by P c N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest sellers revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating. Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents may cheat is not so straightforward. If Pa = 1 (each agent cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price auction, and the sellers expected revenue will be unchanged. Again considering the uniform distribution for agent types, it is not surprising that Pa = 1 2 causes the seller to lose 79 the most revenue. However, even in this worst case, the percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than it is for the second-price auction in which Pc = 1 2 , as shown in Table 1.6 It turns out that setting Pc = 0.2 would make the expected loss of these two settings comparable. While this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.

Agent valuations are drawn from the uniform distribution. 5. RELATED WORK Existing work covers another dimension along which we could analyze cheating: altering the perceived value of N. In this paper, we have assumed that N is known by all of the bidders. However, in an online setting this assumption is rather tenuous. For example, a bidders only source of information about N could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate. In these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation. However, if agents are aware that the seller has this power, then any communication about N to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not credible. Thus, in equilibrium the agents would ignore the declared value of N, and bid according to their own prior beliefs about the number of agents. If we make the natural assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed to any of the bidders. Of course, instead of assuming that the seller can always exploit this power, we could assume that it can only do so with some probability that is known by the agents. The analysis would then proceed in a similar manner as that of our cheating seller model. The other interesting case of this form of cheating is by bidders in a first-price auction. Bidders would obviously want to decrease the perceived number of agents in order to induce their competition to lower their bids. While it is 6 Note that we have not considered the costs of the seller. Thus, the expected loss in profit could be much greater than the numbers that appear here. unreasonable for bidders to be able to alter the perceived N arbitrarily, collusion provides an opportunity to decrease the perceived N by having only one of a group of colluding agents participate in the auction. While the non-colluding agents would account for this possibility, as long as they are not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did not take place. This issue is tackled in [7]. Other types of collusion are of course related to the general topic of cheating in auctions. Results on collusion in first and second-price auctions can be found in [8] and [3], respectively. The work most closely related to our first setting is [11], which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in a second-price auction. In their setting, the seller is a participant in the Bayesian game who decides between running a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never possible) or second-price auction. The seller makes this choice after observing his type, which is his probability of having the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price auction. The bidders, who know the distribution from which the sellers type is drawn, then place their bid. It is shown that, in equilibrium, only a seller with the maximum probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price auction. Our work differs in that we focus on the agents strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability of cheating by the seller. An explicit derivation of the equilibrium strategies then allows us relate first and second-price auctions. An area of related work that can be seen as complementary to ours is that of secure auctions, which takes the point of view of an auction designer. The goals often extend well beyond simply preventing cheating, including properties such as anonymity of the bidders and nonrepudiation of bids. Cryptographic methods are the standard weapon of choice here (see [1, 4, 9]). 6. CONCLUSION In this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid auctions in which cheating is possible. In addition to providing strategy profiles that are stable against deviations, these results give us with insights into both first and second-price auctions. The results for the case of a cheating seller in a second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as endpoints along a continuum. The case of agents cheating in a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution. We also explored the effect of overbidding on the best response bidding strategy for other distributions, and showed that even for relatively simple distributions it can be positive, negative, or neutral. Finally, results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of cheating. 7. REFERENCES [1] M. Franklin and M. Reiter.

In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) Proof. To find an equilibrium, we start by guessing that there exists an equilibrium in which all agents bid according to the same function bi(θi), because the game is symmetric. Further, we guess that bi(θi) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the range [0, 1]. We can also assume that bi(0) = 0, because negative bids are not allowed and a positive bid is not rational when the agents valuation is 0. Note that these are not assumptions on the setting- they are merely limitations that we impose on our search. Let Φi : [0, bi(1)] → [0, 1] be the inverse function of bi(θi). That is, it takes a bid for agent i as input and returns the type θi that induced this bid. Recall Equation 3: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) The probability that a single other bid is below that of agent i is equal to the cdf at the type that would induce a bid equal to that of agent i, which is formally written as F(Φi(bi(θi))). Since all agents are independent, the probability that all other bids are below agent is is simply this term raised the (N − 1)-th power. Thus, we can re-write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi)))· θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (9) We now solve for the expected payment. Plugging Equation 1 (which gives the price for the winning agent) into the term for the expected price in Equation 9, and then simplifying the expectation yields: Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Eθ−i,µc µc · bi(θi) + (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc · bi(θi) + (1 − Pc ) · Eθ−i b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc · bi(θi) + (1 − Pc ) · bi(θi) 0 b[1](θ−i)· pdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) db[1](θ−i) (10) Note that the integral on the last line is taken up to bi(θi) because we are conditioning on the fact that bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i). To derive the pdf of b[1](θ−i) given this condition, we start with the cdf. For a given value b[1](θ−i), the probability that any one agents bid is less than this value is equal to F(Φi(b[1](θ−i))). We then condition on the agents bid being below bi(θi) by dividing by F(Φi(bi(θi))). The cdf for the N − 1 agents is then this value raised to the (N − 1)-th power. cdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = FN−1 (Φi(b[1](θ−i))) FN−1(Φi(bi(θi))) The pdf is then the derivative of the cdf with respect to b[1](θ−i): pdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = N − 1 FN−1(Φi(bi(θi))) · FN−2 (Φi(b[1](θ−i)))· f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i)) Substituting the pdf into Equation 10 and pulling terms out of the integral that do not depend on b[1](θ−i) yields: Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc · bi(θi)+ (1 − Pc ) · (N − 1) FN−1(Φi(bi(θi))) · bi(θi) 0 b[1](θ−i) · FN−2 (Φi(b[1](θ−i)))· f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i)) db[1](θ−i) 81 Plugging the expected price back into the expected utility equation (9), and distributing FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi))), yields: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi))) · θi− FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi))) · Pc · bi(θi)− (1 − Pc ) · (N − 1) · bi(θi) 0 b[1](θ−i) · FN−2 (Φi(b[1](θ−i)))· f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i)) db[1](θ−i) We are now ready to optimize the expected utility by taking the derivative with respect to bi(θi) and setting it to 0. Note that we do not need to solve the integral, because it will disappear when the derivative is taken (by application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). 0 = (N−1)·FN−2 (Φi(bi(θi)))·f(Φi(bi(θi)))·Φi(bi(θi))·θi− FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi))) · Pc − Pc ·(N−1)·FN−2 (Φi(bi(θi)))·f(Φi(bi(θi)))·Φi(bi(θi))·bi(θi)− (1−Pc )·(N−1)· bi(θi)·FN−2 (Φi(bi(θi)))·f(Φi(bi(θi)))·Φi(bi(θi)) Dividing through by FN−2 (Φi(bi(θi))) and combining like terms yields: 0 = θi − Pc · bi(θi) − (1 − Pc ) · bi(θi) · (N − 1) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) − Pc · F(Φi(bi(θi))) Simplifying the expression and rearranging terms produces: bi(θi) = θi − Pc · F(Φi(bi(θi))) (N − 1) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) To further simplify, we use the formula f (x) = 1 g (f(x)) , where g(x) is the inverse function of f(x). Plugging in function from our setting gives us: Φi(bi(θi)) = 1 bi(θi) . Applying both this equation and Φi(bi(θi)) = θi yields: bi(θi) = θi − Pc · F(θi) · bi(θi) (N − 1) · f(θi) (11) Attempts at a derivation of the solution from this point proved fruitless, but we are at a point now where a guessed solution can be quickly verified. We used the solution for the first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]) as our starting point to find the answer: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (12) To verify the solution, we first take its derivative: bi(θi) = 1− F(2· N−1 P c ) (θi) − N−1 P c · F( N−1 P c −1) (θi) · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F(2· N−1 P c ) (θi) This simplifies to: bi(θi) = N−1 P c · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c +1) (θi) We then plug this derivative into the equation we derived (11): bi(θi) = θi − Pc · F(θi) · N−1 P c · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx (N − 1) · f(θi) · F( N−1 P c +1) (θi) Cancelling terms yields Equation 12, verifying that our guessed solution is correct. Alternative Proof of Theorem 1: The following proof uses the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (RET) and the probabilistic auction given as an interpretation of our cheating seller setting. In a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating, the expected payment for an agent with type θi is simply the product of its bid and the probability that this bid is the highest. For the symmetric equilibrium, this is equal to: F(N−1) (θi) · θi − θi 0 F(N−1) (x)dx F(N−1)(θi) For our probabilistic auction, the expected payment of the winning agent is a weighted average of its bid and the second highest bid. For the bi(·) we found in the original interpretation of the setting, it can be written as follows. F(N−1) (θi) · Pc θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) + (1 − Pc ) 1 F(N−1)(θi) · θi 0 x− x 0 F( N−1 P c ) (y)dy F( N−1 P c ) (x) ·(N −1)·F(N−2) (x)·f(x)dx By the RET, the expected payments will be the same in the two auctions. Thus, we can verify our equilibrium bidding strategy by showing that the expected payment in the two auctions is equal. Since the expected payment is zero at θi = 0 for both functions, it suffices to verify that the derivatives of the expected payment functions with respect to θi are equal, for an arbitrary value θi. Thus, we need to verify the following equation: F(N−1) (θi) + (N − 1) · F(N−2) (θi) · f(θi) · θi − F(N−1) (θi) = Pc · F(N−1) (θi) · 1 − 1− (N−1 P c ) · F( N−1 P c −1) (θi) · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F2( N−1 P c ) (θi) + (N − 1) · F(N−2) (θi) · f(θi) · θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) + (1−Pc ) θi− θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (y)dy F( N−1 P c ) (θi) ·(N−1)·F(N−2) (θi)·f(θi) 82 This simplifies to: 0 = Pc · (N−1 P c ) · F(N−2) (θi) · f(θi) · θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) + (N − 1) · F(N−2) (θi) · f(θi) · − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) + (1−Pc ) − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (y)dy F( N−1 P c ) (θi) ·(N−1)·F(N−2) (θi)·f(θi) After distributing Pc , the right-hand side of this equation cancels out, and we have verified our equilibrium bidding strategy. Corollary 2. In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) Proof. Plugging F(θi) = θi into Equation 5 (repeated as 12), we get: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 x( N−1 P c ) dx θi ( N−1 P c ) = θi − P c N−1+P c θi ( N−1+P c P c ) θi ( N−1 P c ) = θi − Pc N − 1 + Pc · θi = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc · θi Theorem 3. In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) Proof. We make the same guesses about the equilibrium strategy to aid our search as we did in the proof of Theorem 1. When simplifying the expectation of this settings utility equation (7), we use the fact that the probability that agent i will have a higher bid than another honest agent is still F(Φi(bi(θi))), while the probability is F(bi(θi)) if the other agent cheats. The probability that agent i beats a single other agent is then a weighted average of these two probabilities. Thus, we can write agent is expected utility as: Eθ−i,µa ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θi) · Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 As before, to find the equilibrium bi(θi), we take the derivative and set it to zero: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−2 · Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 Applying the equations Φi(bi(θi)) = 1 bi(θi) and Φi(bi(θi)) = θi, and dividing through, produces: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(θi) · 1 bi(θi) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(θi) Rearranging terms yields: bi(θi) = θi − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) · bi(θi) (N − 1) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · f(θi) (13) In this setting, because we leave F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution. However, we can simplify the expression by removing its dependence on bi(θi). bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (14) To verify Equation 14, first take its derivative: bi(θi) = 1 − 1− (N − 1) · Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(θi) (N−2) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(θi) · θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) 2(N−1) This equation simplifies to: bi(θi) = (N −1)· Pa ·f(bi(θi))·bi(θi))+(1−Pa )·f(θi) · θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) N Plugging this equation into the bi(θi) in the numerator of Equation 13 yields Equation 14, verifying the solution. 83 Corollary 4. In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. Proof. Instantiating the fixed point equation (8, and repeated as 14) with F(θi) = θi yields: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · bi(x) + (1 − Pa ) · x (N−1) dx Pa · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · θi (N−1) We can plug the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi into this equation in order to verify that it is a fixed point. bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · N−1 N x + (1 − Pa ) · x (N−1) dx Pa · N−1 N θi + (1 − Pa) · θi (N−1) = θi − θi 0 x(N−1) dx θ (N−1) i = θi − 1 N θN i θ (N−1) i = N − 1 N θi Theorem 5. In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. Proof. We again use Φj : [0, bj(1)] → [0, 1] as the inverse of bj(θj). For all j = i in this setting, Φj(x) = N N−1+αj x. The probability that agent i has a higher bid than a single agent j is F(Φj(bi(θi))) = N N−1+αj bi(θi). Note, however, that since Φj(·) is only defined over the range [0, bj(1)], it must be the case that bi(1) ≤ bj(1), which is why αj ≥ 0 is necessary, in addition to being sufficient. Assuming that bi(θi) = N−1 N θi, then indeed Φj(bi(θi)) is always welldefined. We will now show that this assumption is correct. The expected utility for agent i can then be written as: Eθ−i ui(b(θ), θi) = Πj=i N N − 1 + αj bi(θi) · θi −bi(θ) = Πj=i N N − 1 + αj · θi· bi(θi) (N−1) − bi(θi) N Taking the derivative with respect to bi(θi), setting it to zero, and dividing out Πj=i N N−1+αj yields: 0 = θi · (N − 1) · bi(θi) (N−2) − N · bi(θi) (N−1) This simplifies to the solution: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. Full Version of Example 1: In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium. After calculating the symmetric equilibrium in which both agents shave their bid by the same amount, we find the best response to an agent who instead does not shave its bid. We then show that this best response is strictly less than the equilibrium strategy. To find the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy, we instantiate N = 2 in the general formula the equation found in [10], plug in F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 , and simplify: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F(x)dx F(θi) = θi− 1 2 · θi 0 (x2 + x)dx 1 2 · (θ2 i + θi) = θi− 1 3 θ3 i + 1 2 θ2 i θ2 i + θi = 2 3 θ2 i + 1 2 θi θi + 1 We now derive the best response for agent 1 to the strategy b2(θ2) = θ2, denoting the best response strategy b∗ 1(θ1) to distinguish it from the symmetric case. The probability of agent 1 winning is F(b∗ 1(θ1)), which is the probability that agent 2s type is less than agent 1s bid. Thus, agent 1s expected utility is: Eθ2 ui((b∗ 1(θ1), b2(θ2)), θ1) = F(b∗ 1(θ1)) · θ1 − b∗ 1(θ1) = (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + b∗ 1(θ1) 2 · θ1 − b∗ 1(θ1) Taking the derivative with respect to b∗ 1(θ1), setting it to zero, and then rearranging terms gives us: 0 = 1 2 · 2 · b∗ 1(θ1) · θ1 − 3 · (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + θ1 − 2 · b∗ 1(θ1) 0 = 3 · (b∗ 1(θ1))2 + (2 − 2 · θ1) · b∗ 1(θ1) − θ1 Of the two solutions of this equation, one always produces a negative bid. The other is: b∗ 1(θ1) = θ1 − 1 + θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 3 We now need to show that b1(θ1) > b∗ 1(θ1) holds for all θi > 0. Substituting in for both terms, and then simplifying the inequality gives us: 2 3 θ2 1 + 1 2 θ1 θ1 + 1 > θ1 − 1 + θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 3 θ2 1 + 3 2 θ1 + 1 > (θ1 + 1) θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 Since θ1 ≥ 0, we can square both sides of the inequality, which then allows us to verify the inequality for all θ1 > 0. θ4 1 + 3θ3 1 + 17 4 θ2 1 + 3θ1 + 1 > θ4 1 + 3θ3 1 + 4θ2 1 + 3θ1 + 1 1 4 θ2 1 > 0 84",
    "original_translation": "Sobre hacer trampas en subastas de 50 de baja sellada Ryan Porter rwporter@stanford.edu yoav shoham shoham@stanford.edu Departamento de informática de la Universidad de Stanford Stanford, CA 94305 Resumen motivado por el surgimiento de subastas en línea y su relativa falta de seguridad, este documento analiza dos formulariosde hacer trampa en subastas con la chica sellada. El primer tipo de engaño que consideramos ocurre cuando el vendedor espía en las ofertas de una subasta de segundo precio y luego inserta una oferta falsa para aumentar el pago del postor ganador. En el segundo tipo, un postor hace trampa en una subasta de primer precio al examinar las ofertas competidoras antes de decidir sobre su propia oferta. En ambos casos, derivamos estrategias de equilibrio cuando los postores son conscientes de la posibilidad de hacer trampa. Estos resultados proporcionan información sobre las subastas sellodbídicas incluso en ausencia de trampas, incluidos algunos resultados contradictorios sobre los efectos de sobrecargar en una subasta de primer precio. Categorías y descriptores de asignaturas J.4 [Aplicaciones informáticas]: Ciencias sociales y conductuales-economía Términos generales Economía, Seguridad 1. Introducción Entre los tipos de subastas comúnmente utilizadas en la práctica, las subastas con la licitación sellada son una buena opción práctica porque requieren poca comunicación y pueden completarse casi al instante. Cada postor simplemente presenta una oferta, y el ganador se determina de inmediato. Sin embargo, las subastas de mes de día selladas requieren que las ofertas se mantengan privadas hasta que la subasta se aclara. La creciente popularidad de las subastas en línea solo hace que esta desventaja sea más problemática. En una casa de subastas, con todos los participantes presentes, es difícil examinar una oferta que otro postor dio directamente al subastador. Sin embargo, en una subasta en línea, el subastador a menudo es poco más que un servidor con seguridad cuestionable;Y, dado que todos los participantes se encuentran en diferentes ubicaciones, uno puede intentar entrar de forma anónima en el servidor. En este artículo, presentamos un análisis teórico del juego de cómo los postores deben comportarse cuando son conscientes de la posibilidad de hacer trampa basada en el conocimiento de las ofertas. Investigamos este tipo de trampa a lo largo de dos dimensiones: ya sea el subastador o un postor que trampa, y qué variante se usa (primer o segundo precio) de la subasta de licitación sellada. Tenga en cuenta que dos de estos casos son triviales. En nuestro entorno, no hay ningún incentivo para que el vendedor presente una oferta de shill en una primera subasta de precios, porque hacerlo cancelaría la subasta o no afectaría el pago del licitador ganador. En una subasta de segundo precio, conocer las ofertas competidoras no ayuda a un postor porque es una estrategia dominante ofertar con sinceridad. Esto nos deja con dos casos que examinamos en detalle. Un vendedor puede hacer trampa de manera rentable en una subasta de segundo precio al observar las ofertas antes de que la subasta se aclare y presente una oferta adicional. Esta posibilidad se señaló ya en el documento seminal [12] que introdujo este tipo de subasta. Por ejemplo, si los postores en una subasta de eBay usan un postor proxy (esencialmente creando una subasta de segundo precio), entonces el vendedor puede entrar en el servidor de eBays, observar el precio máximo que un postor está dispuesto a pagar, yLuego, extraiga este precio enviando una oferta de shill justo debajo de ella utilizando una identidad falsa. Suponemos que no hay posibilidad de que el vendedor sea atrapado cuando haga trampa. Sin embargo, no todos los vendedores están dispuestos a usar este poder (o, no todos los vendedores pueden hacer trampa con éxito). Suponemos que cada postor conoce la probabilidad con la que el vendedor hará trampa. La posible motivación para este conocimiento podría ser una exposición recientemente publicada sobre trampa del vendedor en subastas de eBay. En este entorno, derivamos una estrategia de licitación de equilibrio para el caso en el que cada valor de los licitadores para el bien se extrae independientemente de una distribución común (sin más suposiciones, excepto la continuidad y la diferenciabilidad). Este resultado muestra cómo las subastas de primera y segundo precio pueden verse como los puntos finales de un espectro de subastas. Pero, ¿por qué el vendedor debería divertirse? En una subasta de primer precio, un postor debe ofertar por debajo de su valor para el bien (también llamado afeitado su oferta) para tener una utilidad positiva si él gana 76. Para decidir cuánto afeitar su oferta, debe intercambiar la probabilidad de ganar la subasta contra cuánto pagará si gane. Por supuesto, si simplemente pudiera examinar las otras ofertas antes de presentar las suyas, entonces su problema se resuelve: ofertar el mínimo necesario para ganar la subasta. En este entorno, nuestro objetivo es obtener una estrategia de licitación de equilibrio para un postor que no sea ideal que sea consciente de la posibilidad de que esté compitiendo contra los postores de trampa. Cuando los valores del postor se extraen de la distribución uniforme comúnmente analizada, mostramos el resultado contradictorio de que la posibilidad de hacer trampa de otros postores no tiene ningún efecto en la estrategia de equilibrio de un postor honesto. Este resultado se extiende luego para mostrar la robustez del equilibrio de una subasta de primer precio sin la posibilidad de hacer trampa. Concluimos esta sección explorando otras distribuciones, incluidas algunas en las que la presencia de postores de trampa realmente induce a un postor honesto a reducir su oferta. El resto del documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 formalizamos la configuración y presentamos nuestros resultados para el caso de un vendedor que hace trampa en una segunda subasta de precios. La Sección 3 cubre el caso de los licitadores que hacen trampa en una subasta de primer precio. En la Sección 4, cuantificamos los efectos que la posibilidad de hacer trampa tiene en un vendedor honesto en los dos entornos. Discutimos el trabajo relacionado, incluidas otras formas de trampa en subastas, en la Sección 5, antes de concluir con la Sección 6. Todas las pruebas y derivaciones se encuentran en el apéndice.2. Subasta de segundo precio, Vendedor en esta sección, consideramos una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor puede hacer trampa insertando una oferta de chelín después de observar todas las ofertas. La formulación para esta sección se reutilizará en gran medida en la siguiente sección sobre los postores que hacen trampa en una subasta de primer precio. Si bien no se supone ningún conocimiento previo de la teoría de juegos o la teoría de la subasta, se pueden encontrar buenas introducciones en [2] y [6], respectivamente.2.1 Formulación La configuración consta de n licitadores, o agentes, (indexado por i = 1, · · ·, n) y un vendedor. Cada agente tiene un tipo θi ∈ [0, 1], extraído de un rango continuo, que representa el valor de los agentes para el bien subastado.1], donde f (0) = 0 y F (1) = 1. Suponemos que F (·) está estrictamente aumentando y diferenciable durante el intervalo [0, 1]. Llame a la función de densidad de probabilidad (PDF) F (θi) = F (θi), que es el derivado del CDF. Cada agente conoce su propio tipo θi, pero solo la distribución sobre los posibles tipos de los otros agentes. Una estrategia de licitación para un agente bi: [0, 1] → [0, 1] asigna su tipo a su oferta.3 Sea θ = (θ1, · · ·, θn) el vector de los tipos para todos los agentes, y θ−i = (θ1, · · ·, θi - 1, θi+1, · · · θn) sea el vector de todos los tipos, excepto el del agente i. Luego podemos combinar los vectores para que θ = (θi, θ - i). También definimos el vector de BIDS como B (θ) = (B1 (θ1), ..., Bn (θn)), y este vector sin 2 podemos restringir los tipos al rango [0, 1] sin pérdida degeneralidad porque cualquier distribución en un rango diferente puede normalizarse a este rango.3 Por lo tanto, limitamos a los agentes a estrategias de licitación deterministas, pero, debido a nuestra suposición de continuidad, siempre existe un equilibrio de estrategia pura.la oferta del agente I como b - i (θ - i). Sea B [1] (θ) el valor de la oferta más alta del vector B (θ), con una definición correspondiente para B [1] (θ - I). Obviamente, un agente gana la subasta si su oferta es mayor que todas las demás ofertas, pero los lazos complican la formulación. Afortunadamente, podemos ignorar el caso de los lazos en este documento porque nuestra suposición de continuidad los convertirá en un evento de probabilidad cero en equilibrio. Suponemos que el vendedor no establece un precio de reserva.4 Si el vendedor no hace trampa, entonces el agente ganador paga la oferta más alta de otro agente. Por otro lado, si el vendedor hace trampa, entonces el agente ganador pagará su oferta, ya que asumimos que un vendedor engaño aprovecharía al máximo su poder. Deje que la variable indicadora µC sea 1 si el vendedor hace trampa y 0 de lo contrario. La probabilidad de que el vendedor haga trampa, PC, sea conocido por todos los agentes.5 Podemos escribir el pago del agente ganador de la siguiente manera.pi (b (θ), µc) = µc · bi (θi) - (1 - µC) · b [1] (θ - i) (1) Sea µ (·) una función indicadora que toma una desigualdad como unEl argumento y las devoluciones son 1 si se mantiene, y 0 de lo contrario. La utilidad para el Agente I es cero si no gana la subasta, y la diferencia entre su valoración y su precio si lo hace.ui (b (θ), µc, θi) = µ bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) · θi - pi (b (θ), µc) (2) Nos preocuparemos por la utilidad esperadade un agente, con la expectativa tomada de los tipos de otros agentes y sobre si el vendedor hace trampa. Al impulsar la expectativa hacia adentro para que solo sea por encima del precio (condicionado al agente que gane la subasta), podemos escribir la utilidad esperada como: eθ - i, µC [ui (b (θ), µc, θi)] =Prob Bi (θi)> B [1] (θ - i) · θi - eθ - i, µC pi (b (θ), µC) |BI (θi)> B [1] (θ - i) (3) Suponemos que todos los agentes son maximizadores de utilidad racionales y esperados. Debido a la incertidumbre sobre los tipos de otros agentes, buscaremos un equilibrio de Bayes-Nash. Un vector de estrategias de licitación B ∗ es un equilibrio de Bayes-Nash si para cada agente I y cada posible tipo θi, agente No puedo aumentar su utilidad esperada utilizando una estrategia de licitación alternativa BI, manteniendo las estrategias de licitación para todos los demás agentes fijos. Formalmente, b ∗ es un equilibrio de bayes-nash if: ∀i, θi, bi eθ-i, µc ui b ∗ i (θi), b ∗ −i (θ-i), µC, θi ≥ eθ-i, µCUI BI (θi), B ∗ −i (θ-i), µC, θi (4) 2.2 Equilibrio primero presentamos el equilibrio de bayes-nash para una distribución arbitraria f (·).4 Esto simplifica el análisis, pero todos nuestros resultados se pueden aplicar al caso en el que el vendedor anuncia un precio de reserva antes de que comience la subasta.5 Tenga en cuenta que el conocimiento común no es necesario para la existencia de un equilibrio.77 Teorema 1. En una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor hace trampa con PC de probabilidad, es un equilibrio de bayes-nash para cada agente ofertar de acuerdo con la siguiente estrategia: bi (θi) = θi-θi 0 f (n-1 p)(x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) (5) Es útil considerar los puntos extremos de la PC. La configuración de PC = 1 produce el resultado correcto para una subasta de primer precio (ver, por ejemplo, [10]). En el caso de PC = 0, esta solución no está definida. Sin embargo, en el límite, BI (θi) se acerca a θi a medida que la PC se acerca 0, que es lo que esperamos cuando la subasta se acerca a una subasta estándar de segundo precio. La posición de PC es quizás sorprendente. Por ejemplo, la combinación lineal bi (θi) = θi-pc · θi 0 f (n-1) (x) dx f (n-1) (θi) de las estrategias de licitación de equilibrio de las subastas de primer y segundo precio tendríanTambién nos dieron las estrategias de licitación correctas para los casos de PC = 0 y PC = 1. 2.3 Continuo de subastas Una perspectiva alternativa en la configuración es como un continuo entre las subastas de primer y segundo precio. Considere una subasta probabilística de licitación sellada en la que el vendedor es honesto, pero el precio pagado por el agente ganador está determinado por un cambio de moneda ponderado: con probabilidad PC, es su oferta, y con probabilidad 1-PC es la segunda más alta, es la segunda más alta.licitación. Al ajustar la PC, podemos moverse suavemente entre una subasta de primer y segundo precio. Además, el hecho de que esta subasta probabilística satisface las propiedades requeridas para el teorema de equivalencia de ingresos (ver, por ejemplo, [2]) proporciona una forma de verificar que la estrategia de licitación en la Ecuación 5 es el equilibrio simétrico de esta subasta (ver la prueba alternativadel Teorema 1 en el Apéndice).2.4 Caso especial: Distribución uniforme Otra forma de tratar de obtener información sobre la Ecuación 5 es instanciar la distribución de tipos. Ahora consideramos la distribución uniforme a menudo estudiada: F (θi) = θi. Corolario 2. En una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor hace trampa con PC de probabilidad, y F (θi) = θi, es un equilibrio de bayes-Nash para cada agente ofertar de acuerdo con la siguiente estrategia: BI (θi) = n-1 n-1 + PC θi (6) Esta estrategia de licitación de equilibrio, parametrizada por PC, puede verse como una interpolación entre dos resultados bien conocidos. Cuando PC = 0, la estrategia de licitación ahora está bien definida (cada agente ofrece su tipo verdadero), mientras que cuando PC = 1 obtenemos el resultado correcto para una subasta de primer precio: cada agente ofrece de acuerdo con la estrategia bi (θi) = n−1 n θi.3. Subasta de primer precio, agentes de trampa que ahora consideramos el caso en el que el vendedor es honesto, pero existe la posibilidad de que los agentes engañen y examinen las otras ofertas antes de presentar las suyas (o, alternativamente, revisarán su oferta antes de la subastaborra). Dado que este tipo de trampa no tiene sentido en una subasta de segundo precio, solo analizamos el caso de una subasta de primer precio. Después de revisar la formulación de la sección anterior, presentamos una ecuación de punto fijo para la estrategia de equilibrio para una distribución arbitraria F (·). Esta ecuación será útil para el análisis de la distribución uniforme, en la que mostramos que la posibilidad de que los agentes trampa no cambien la estrategia de equilibrio de los agentes honestos. Este resultado tiene implicaciones para la robustez del equilibrio simétrico para sobrecargar en una subasta estándar de primer precio. Además, encontramos que para otras distribuciones que sobresalen en realidad induce a un agente competidor a afeitarse más de su oferta.3.1 Formulación Está claro que si un solo agente está haciendo trampa, ofertará (hasta su valoración) la cantidad mínima necesaria para ganar la subasta. Sin embargo, es menos obvio lo que sucederá si varios agentes hacen trampa. Uno podría imaginar un escenario similar a una subasta en inglés, en el que todos los agentes de trampa siguen revisando sus ofertas hasta que todos los tramposos quieran el bien en la oferta ganadora actual. Sin embargo, solo nos preocupa cómo un agente honesto debe ofertar dado que es consciente de la posibilidad de hacer trampa. Por lo tanto, es suficiente para un agente honesto saber que ganará la subasta si y solo si su oferta excede cualquier oferta de agentes honestos y todos los agentes de trampa. Esta intuición puede formalizarse como la siguiente subasta discriminatoria. En la primera etapa, se determina la regla de pago de cada agente. Con probabilidad PA, el agente pagará la segunda oferta más alta si gana la subasta (esencialmente, es un tramposo), y de lo contrario tendrá que pagar su oferta. Estas selecciones se registran mediante un vector de variables indicadoras µA = (µA1, ..., µan), donde µai = 1 denota que el agente I paga la segunda oferta más alta. Cada agente conoce la probabilidad de PA, pero no conoce la regla de pago para todos los demás agentes. De lo contrario, esta subasta es una subasta estándar y vegetal sellada. Por lo tanto, es una estrategia dominante para un tramposo ofertar su tipo verdadero, lo que hace que esta formulación sea estratégicamente equivalente a la configuración descrita en el párrafo anterior. La expresión de la utilidad de un agente honesto en esta subasta discriminatoria es la siguiente.ui (b (θ), µa, θi) = θi - bi (θ) · j = i µaj · µ bi (θi)> θj + (1 - µaj) · µ bi (θi)> bj (θj) (7) (7) 3.2 Equilibrio Nuestro objetivo es encontrar el equilibrio en el que todos los agentes de trampa usan su estrategia dominante de ofertar con sinceridad y honestas ofertas de acuerdo con una estrategia de licitación simétrica. Como hemos dejado f (·) no especificado, no podemos presentar una solución de forma cerrada para la estrategia de licitación de agentes honestos y, en su lugar, dar una ecuación de punto fijo para ello. Teorema 3. En una subasta de primer precio en la que cada agente hace trampa con probabilidad PA, es un equilibrio de Bayes-Nash para que cada agente no trato I oferte de acuerdo con la estrategia que es un punto fijo de la siguiente ecuación: BI (θi) =θi - θi 0 pa · f (bi (x)) + (1 - pa) · f (x) (n - 1) dx pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi)(N - 1) (8) 78 3.3 Caso especial: Distribución uniforme Dado que no pudimos resolver la Ecuación 8 en el caso general, solo podemos ver cómo la posibilidad de hacer trampa afecta la estrategia de licitación de equilibrio para casos particulares de F (·). Un lugar natural para comenzar es la distribución uniforme: F (θi) = θi. Recuerde la lógica detrás de la estrategia de equilibrio simétrico en una subasta de primer precio sin hacer trampa: bi (θi) = n-1 n θi es la compensación óptima entre aumentar la probabilidad de ganar y disminuir el precio pagado al ganar, dado que los otros agentesestán haciendo una oferta de acuerdo con la misma estrategia. Dado que en el entorno actual, los agentes de trampa no afeitan su oferta en absoluto y, por lo tanto, disminuyen la probabilidad de un agente honesto de ganar (aunque obviamente no afectan el precio que un agente honesto paga si gana), es natural esperar que un agente honestoDebería compensar aumentando su oferta. La idea es que sacrificar algunas ganancias potenciales para recuperar parte de la probabilidad perdida de ganar volvería a poner en marcha los dos lados de la compensación. Sin embargo, resulta que la estrategia de licitación de equilibrio no cambia. Corolario 4. En una subasta de primer precio en la que cada agente hace trampa con probabilidad PA, y F (θi) = θi, es un equilibrio de Bayesnash para que cada agente no trato de oferta de acuerdo con la estrategia bi (θi) = n-1 θi. Este resultado sugiere que el equilibrio de una subasta de primer precio es particularmente robusto cuando los tipos se extraen de la distribución uniforme, ya que la mejor respuesta no se ve afectada por las desviaciones de los otros agentes a la estrategia de siempre ofertar su tipo. De hecho, mientras todos los demás agentes se afeitan su oferta por una fracción (que puede diferir entre los agentes) no más que 1 n, sigue siendo una mejor respuesta para que el agente restante oferte de acuerdo con la estrategia de equilibrio. Tenga en cuenta que este resultado se mantiene incluso si otros agentes se afeitan su oferta por una fracción negativa y, por lo tanto, están haciendo una oferta irracional por encima de su tipo. Teorema 5. En una subasta de primer precio donde f (θi) = θi, si cada agente J = I oferta según una estrategia bj (θj) = n-1+αj n θj, donde αj ≥ 0, entonces es una mejor respuesta para elEl agente restante I para ofertar de acuerdo con la estrategia bi (θi) = n - 1 n θi. Obviamente, estos perfiles de estrategia no son equilibrios (a menos que cada αJ = 0), porque cada agente J tiene un incentivo para establecer αJ = 0. El objetivo de este teorema es que una amplia gama de posibles creencias que un agente puede tener sobre las estrategias de los otros agentes lo llevará a jugar la estrategia de equilibrio. Esto es importante porque una crítica común (y válida) de los conceptos de equilibrio como Nash y Bayesnash es que guardan en silencio cómo los agentes convergen en un perfil de estrategia del que nadie quiere desviarse. Sin embargo, si la estrategia de equilibrio es una mejor respuesta a un gran conjunto de perfiles de estrategia que están fuera de equilibrio, entonces parece mucho más plausible que los agentes realmente convergen en este equilibrio. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que, si bien este equilibrio es robusto contra las desviaciones arbitrarias a las estrategias que se afeitan menos, no es robusto ni siquiera un solo agente que se afeite más de su oferta. De hecho, si tomamos algún perfil de estrategia consistente con las condiciones del Teorema 5 y cambiamos una estrategia JS de un solo agente para que su αJ correspondiente sea negativo, entonces el agente es la mejor respuesta es afeitarse más de 1 n de su oferta.3.4 Efectos del sobremarga para otras distribuciones Una pregunta natural es si la mejor estrategia de licitación de respuesta es igualmente sólida para sobrecargar por los agentes competidores para otras distribuciones. Resulta que el teorema 5 es válido para todas las distribuciones de la forma f (θi) = (θi) k, donde k es un entero positivo. Sin embargo, tomar una combinación lineal simple de dos de estas distribuciones para producir f (θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 produce una distribución en la que un agente realmente debería afeitarse más su oferta cuando otros agentes afeitan sus ofertas menos. En el ejemplo que presentamos para esta distribución (con los detalles en el apéndice), solo hay dos jugadores y la desviación de un agente es ofertar su tipo. Sin embargo, se puede generalizar a un mayor número de agentes y a otras desviaciones. Ejemplo 1. En una subasta de primer precio donde f (θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 y n = 2, si el agente 2 siempre ofrece su tipo (b2 (θ2) = θ2), entonces, para todos θ1> 0, el agente 1s mejor respuestaLa estrategia de licitación es estrictamente menor que la estrategia de licitación del equilibrio simétrico. También observamos que el mismo resultado es válido para la distribución exponencial normalizada (F (θi) = eθi −1 e - 1). Ciertamente, es el caso de que se pueden encontrar distribuciones que respalden la intuición dada anteriormente que los agentes deben afeitarse menos su oferta cuando otros agentes están haciendo lo mismo. Los ejemplos incluyen F (θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (la solución al sistema de ecuaciones: f (θi) = −1, f (0) = 0 y f (1) = 1), yF (θi) = e - e (1 --θi) E - 1. Sería útil relacionar la dirección del cambio en la estrategia de licitación de la mejor respuesta con una condición general en F (·). Desafortunadamente, no pudimos encontrar tal condición, en parte porque la integral en la estrategia de licitación simétrica de una subasta de primer precio no puede resolverse sin saber F (·) (o al menos algunas restricciones en ella). Sin embargo, notamos que el signo de la segunda derivada de F (θi)/F (θi) es un predictor preciso para todas las distribuciones que consideramos.4. Pérdida de ingresos para un vendedor honesto en ambos entornos que cubrimos, un vendedor honesto sufre una pérdida en los ingresos esperados debido a la posibilidad de hacer trampa. Las estrategias de licitación de equilibrio que obtuvimos nos permiten cuantificar esta pérdida. Aunque esto es lo más lejos que tomaremos el análisis, podría aplicarse a entornos más generales, en los que el vendedor podría, por ejemplo, elegir el mercado en el que vende su bien o pagar a un tercero de confianza para supervisar la subasta. En una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor puede hacer trampa, un vendedor honesto sufre debido al hecho de que los agentes se afeitarán sus ofertas. Para el caso en el que los tipos de agentes se extraen de la distribución uniforme, cada agente se afeitará su oferta por P C N - 1+P C, que también es la fracción por la cual los ingresos de los vendedores honestos disminuyen debido a la posibilidad de hacer trampa. El análisis del caso de una subasta de primer precio en la que los agentes pueden hacer trampa no es tan sencillo. Si PA = 1 (cada agente engaña con certeza), entonces simplemente tenemos una subasta de segundo precio, y los ingresos esperados de los vendedores no cambiarán. Una vez más, teniendo en cuenta la distribución uniforme para los tipos de agentes, no es sorprendente que PA = 1 2 haga que el vendedor pierda 79 más ingresos. Sin embargo, incluso en este peor de los casos, el porcentaje de ingresos esperados perdidos es significativamente menor que para la subasta de segundo precio en la que PC = 1 2, como se muestra en la Tabla 1.6, resulta que configurar PC = 0.2 haría que la esperada se esperepérdida de estas dos configuraciones comparables. Si bien es poco probable que esta comparación entre la configuración sea útil para un vendedor, es interesante observar que las sospechas de agentes de posibles trampas por parte del vendedor son, en cierto sentido, peores que los agentes que realmente se engañan a sí mismos. Porcentaje de ingresos perdidos para una subasta de primer precio de subasta de segundo precio de agentes honestos (PC = 0.5) (PA = 0.5) 2 33 12 5 11 4.0 10 5.3 1.8 15 4.0 1.5 25 2.2 0.83 50 1.1 0.38 100 0.50 0.17 Tabla 1: El porcentaje de ingresos esperados perdidos por un vendedor honesto debido a la posibilidad de hacer trampa en los dos entornos considerados en este documento. Las valoraciones del agente se extraen de la distribución uniforme.5. Trabajo relacionado El trabajo existente cubre otra dimensión a lo largo de la cual podríamos analizar las trampas: alterar el valor percibido de N. En este documento, hemos asumido que N es conocido por todos los postores. Sin embargo, en un entorno en línea, esta suposición es bastante tenue. Por ejemplo, una fuente de información de los postores sobre N podría ser un contador que el vendedor coloca en la página web de la subasta, o una declaración del vendedor sobre la cantidad de posibles postores que han indicado que participarán. En estos casos, el vendedor podría manipular arbitrariamente el N. percibido en una subasta de primer precio, el vendedor obviamente tiene un incentivo para aumentar el valor percibido de N para inducir a los agentes a ofertar más cerca de su verdadera valoración. Sin embargo, si los agentes son conscientes de que el vendedor tiene este poder, entonces cualquier comunicación sobre N a los agentes es una charla barata, y además no es creíble. Por lo tanto, en equilibrio, los agentes ignorarían el valor declarado de N, y ofertarían de acuerdo con sus propias creencias previas sobre el número de agentes. Si hacemos la suposición natural de un anterior común, entonces la configuración se reduce al que se aborda [5], que derivó las estrategias de licitación de equilibrio de una subasta de primer precio cuando el número de licitadores se extrae de una distribución conocida pero no se revela.a cualquiera de los postores. Por supuesto, en lugar de asumir que el vendedor siempre puede explotar este poder, podríamos suponer que solo puede hacerlo con cierta probabilidad que los agentes conocen. El análisis continuaría de manera similar a la de nuestro modelo de vendedor de trampa. El otro caso interesante de esta forma de engaño es de los postores en una subasta de primer precio. Los postores obviamente querrían disminuir el número percibido de agentes para inducir a su competencia a reducir sus ofertas. Si bien es 6 nota que no hemos considerado los costos del vendedor. Por lo tanto, la pérdida esperada en las ganancias podría ser mucho mayor que los números que aparecen aquí.Irrazonable que los postores puedan alterar la N percibida arbitrariamente, la colusión brinda la oportunidad de disminuir la N percibida al tener solo uno de un grupo de agentes coludentes que participan en la subasta. Si bien los agentes no coludantes explicarían esta posibilidad, siempre y cuando no estén seguros de la colusión, aún serán inducidos a afeitarse más de sus ofertas de lo que lo harían si la colusión no tuviera lugar. Este problema se aborda en [7]. Por supuesto, otros tipos de colusión están relacionados con el tema general de hacer trampa en subastas. Los resultados sobre la colusión en subastas de primer y segundo precio se pueden encontrar en [8] y [3], respectivamente. El trabajo más relacionado con nuestra primera configuración es [11], que también presenta un modelo en el que el vendedor puede hacer trampa en una subasta de segundo precio. En su entorno, el vendedor es un participante en el juego bayesiano que decide entre una subasta de primer precio (donde nunca es posible hacer trampa rentable) o una subasta de segundo precio. El vendedor toma esta decisión después de observar su tipo, que es su probabilidad de tener la oportunidad y la voluntad de hacer trampa en una subasta de segundo precio. Los postores, que conocen la distribución de la que se extrae el tipo de vendedores, luego colocan su oferta. Se muestra que, en equilibrio, solo un vendedor con la máxima probabilidad de hacer trampa elegiría ejecutar una subasta de segundo precio. Nuestro trabajo difiere en el sentido de que nos centramos en las estrategias de los agentes en una subasta de segundo precio para una probabilidad dada de hacer trampa por parte del vendedor. Una derivación explícita de las estrategias de equilibrio nos permite relacionarnos con subastas de primer y segundo precio. Un área de trabajo relacionado que puede verse como complementario al nuestro es el de las subastas seguras, que toma el punto de vista de un diseñador de subastas. Los objetivos a menudo se extienden mucho más allá de simplemente prevenir el engaño, incluidas las propiedades como el anonimato de los postores y la no repudio de las ofertas. Los métodos criptográficos son el arma de elección estándar aquí (ver [1, 4, 9]).6. Conclusión En este documento presentamos el equilibrio de las subastas de la chica sellada en las que es posible hacer trampa. Además de proporcionar perfiles de estrategia que son estables contra las desviaciones, estos resultados nos dan ideas sobre las subastas de primer y segundo precio. Los resultados para el caso de un vendedor de engaño en una subasta de segundo precio nos permiten relacionar las dos subastas como puntos finales a lo largo de un continuo. El caso de los agentes que engañan en una subasta de primer precio mostró la robustez del equilibrio de la subasta de primer precio cuando los tipos de agentes se extraen de la distribución uniforme. También exploramos el efecto de sobrecargar la estrategia de licitación de la mejor respuesta para otras distribuciones, y mostramos que incluso para distribuciones relativamente simples puede ser positiva, negativa o neutral. Finalmente, los resultados de nuestras dos configuraciones nos permitieron cuantificar la pérdida esperada de ingresos para un vendedor debido a la posibilidad de hacer trampa.7. Referencias [1] M.

En una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor hace trampa con PC de probabilidad, es un equilibrio de bayes-nash para cada agente ofertar de acuerdo con la siguiente estrategia: bi (θi) = θi-θi 0 f (n-1 p)(x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) (5) prueba. Para encontrar un equilibrio, comenzamos adivinando que existe un equilibrio en el que todos los agentes ofertan de acuerdo con la misma función BI (θi), porque el juego es simétrico. Además, suponemos que BI (θi) está estrictamente aumentando y diferenciable en el rango [0, 1]. También podemos suponer que BI (0) = 0, porque las ofertas negativas no están permitidas y una oferta positiva no es racional cuando la valoración de los agentes es 0. Tenga en cuenta que estos no son suposiciones en la configuración: son simplemente limitaciones que imponemos a nuestra búsqueda. Sea φi: [0, bi (1)] → [0, 1] la función inversa de BI (θi). Es decir, se necesita una oferta para el agente I como entrada y devuelve el tipo θi que indujo esta oferta. Ecuación de recuperación 3: eθ - i, µC ui (b (θ), µc, θi) = prob BI (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) · θi - eθ - i, µc pi (b (θ), µC) |BI (θi)> B [1] (θ - i) La probabilidad de que una otra oferta esté por debajo de la del Agente I es igual al CDF en el tipo que induciría una oferta igual a la del Agente I, que es formalmenteescrito como f (φi (bi (θi))). Dado que todos los agentes son independientes, la probabilidad de que todas las demás ofertas estén por debajo del agente es simplemente este término elevado el poder (n-1). Por lo tanto, podemos reescribir la utilidad esperada como: eθ-i, µc ui (b (θ), µc, θi) = fn-1 (φi (bi (θi)) · θi-eθ-i, µc pii(B (θ), µC) |BI (θi)> B [1] (θ - i) (9) Ahora resolvemos el pago esperado. Conectando la ecuación 1 (que da el precio del agente ganador) al término para el precio esperado en la ecuación 9, y luego simplificando las expectativas rendimientos: Eθ - I, µC pi (b (θ), µC) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) = eθ - i, µc µc · bi (θi) + (1 - µc) · b [1] (θ - i) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) = pc · bi (θi) + (1 - pc) · eθ - i b [1] (θ - i) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) = pc · bi (θi) + (1 - pc) · bi (θi) 0 b [1] (θ - i) · pdf b [1] (θ−i) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) db [1] (θ - i) (10) Tenga en cuenta que la integral en la última línea se lleva a bi (θi) porque estamos condicionando el hecho de queBI (θi)> B [1] (θ - i). Para derivar el PDF de B [1] (θ - I) Dada esta condición, comenzamos con el CDF. Para un valor dado B [1] (θ - i), la probabilidad de que cualquier agente de agente sea menor que este valor es igual a F (φi (B [1] (θ - i))). Luego condicionamos que los agentes tengan una oferta por debajo de Bi (θi) dividiendo por F (φi (bi (θi))). El CDF para los agentes N-1 es entonces este valor elevado a la potencia (n-1) -th.CDF B [1] (θ - i) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) = fn - 1 (φi (b [1] (θ - i))) fn - 1 (φi (bi (θi))) El pdf es entonces el derivadodel CDF con respecto a B [1] (θ - i): PDF B [1] (θ - i) |bi (θi)> b [1] (θ - i) = n - 1 fn - 1 (φi (bi (θi))) · fn - 2 (φi (b [1] (θ - i)) · f(Φi (b [1] (θ - i))) · φi (b [1] (θ - i)) que sustituye el PDF a la ecuación 10 y extrae términos de la integral que no depende de b [1] ((1] (θ - i) produce: eθ - i, µc pi (b (θ), µc) |Bi (θi)> B [1] (θ - i) = PC · Bi (θi)+ (1 - PC) · (N - 1) Fn - 1 (φi (BI (θi))) · Bi (θi)0 b [1] (θ - i) · fn - 2 (φi (b [1] (θ - i))) · f (φi (b [1] (θ - i))) · φi (b [1] (θ - i)) db [1] (θ - i) 81 enchufando el precio esperado nuevamente a la ecuación de utilidad esperada (9) y distribuyendo Fn - 1 (φi (bi (θi)), rendimientos: eθ−i, µC ui (b (θ), µc, θi) = fn - 1 (φi (bi (θi))) · θi− fn - 1 (φi (bi (θi))) · pc · bi (θi) -−(1 - pc) · (n - 1) · bi (θi) 0 b [1] (θ - i) · fn - 2 (φi (b [1] (θ - i)) · f (φi (b[1] (θ - i))) · φi (b [1] (θ - i)) db [1] (θ - i) Ahora estamos listos para optimizar la utilidad esperada tomando el derivado con respecto a BI (θi) y configurarlo en 0. Tenga en cuenta que no necesitamos resolver la integral, ya que desaparecerá cuando se tome la derivada (mediante la aplicación del teorema fundamental del cálculo).0 = (n - 1) · fn - 2 (φi (bi (θi))) · f (φi (bi (θi))) · φi (bi (θi)) · θi− fn - 1 (φi (bi (bi (bi (bi (bi (bi (θi))) · pc - pc · (n - 1) · fn - 2 (φi (bi (θi))) · f (φi (bi (θi))) · φi (bi (θi)) · bi (θi) - (1 - pc) · (n - 1) · bi (θi) · fn - 2 (φi (bi (θi))) · f (φi (bi (θi))) · φi (bi (θi))Dividiendo a través de fn - 2 (φi (bi (θi))) y la combinación de términos similares produce: 0 = θi - pc · bi (θi) - (1 - pc) · bi (θi) · (n - 1) · f(Φi (bi (θi)))) · φi (bi (θi)) - pc · f (φi (bi (bi (θi))) que simplifica la expresión y los términos de reorganización producen: bi (θi) = θi - pc · f (φi(bi (θi))) (n - 1) · f (φi (bi (θi))) · φi (bi (θi))) Para simplificar aún más, usamos la fórmula f (x) = 1 g (f (x)), donde g (x) es la función inversa de F (x). La función de enchufación de nuestra configuración nos da: φi (bi (θi)) = 1 bi (θi). Aplicando tanto esta ecuación como φi (bi (θi)) = θi produce: bi (θi) = θi - pc · f (θi) · bi (θi) (n - 1) · f (θi) (11) intentos en aLa derivación de la solución desde este punto resultó infructuosa, pero ahora estamos en un punto en el que se puede verificar rápidamente una solución adivinada. Utilizamos la solución para la subasta de primer precio (ver, por ejemplo, [10]) como nuestro punto de partida para encontrar la respuesta: bi (θi) = θi-θi 0 f (n-1 p c) (x) dx f(N - 1 p c) (θi) (12) Para verificar la solución, primero tomamos su derivado: bi (θi) = 1− f (2 · n - 1 p c) (θi) - n - 1 p c· F (n - 1 p c −1) (θi) · f (θi) · θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx f (2 · n - 1 p c) (θi) Esto se simplifica: bi (θi) = n - 1 p c · f (θi) · θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx f (n - 1 p c +1) (θi) Luego conectamos esta derivada aLa ecuación derivamos (11): bi (θi) = θi - pc · f (θi) · n - 1 p c · f (θi) · θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx (n −1) · F (θi) · F (n - 1 p c +1) (θi) Los términos de cancelación producen la ecuación 12, verificando que nuestra solución adivinada es correcta. Prueba alternativa del teorema 1: La siguiente prueba utiliza el teorema de equivalencia de ingresos (RET) y la subasta probabilística dada como una interpretación de nuestro entorno de vendedor de trampa. En una subasta de primer precio sin la posibilidad de hacer trampa, el pago esperado de un agente con tipo θi es simplemente el producto de su oferta y la probabilidad de que esta oferta sea la más alta. Para el equilibrio simétrico, esto es igual a: f (n - 1) (θi) · θi - θi 0 f (n - 1) (x) dx f (n - 1) (θi) para nuestra subasta probabilística, la esperadaEl pago del agente ganador es un promedio ponderado de su oferta y la segunda oferta más alta. Para el BI (·) encontramos en la interpretación original de la configuración, se puede escribir de la siguiente manera. F (n - 1) (θi) · pc θi - θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) + (1 - pc) 1 f (n - 1) (θi) · θi 0 x− x 0 f (n - 1 p c) (y) dy f (n - 1 p c) (x) · (n −1) · f (n - 2) (x)· F (x) dx Por el RET, los pagos esperados serán los mismos en las dos subastas. Por lo tanto, podemos verificar nuestra estrategia de licitación de equilibrio al demostrar que el pago esperado en las dos subastas es igual. Dado que el pago esperado es cero en θi = 0 para ambas funciones, es suficiente verificar que las derivadas de las funciones de pago esperadas con respecto a θi sean iguales, para un valor arbitrario θi. Por lo tanto, necesitamos verificar la siguiente ecuación: f (n - 1) (θi) + (n - 1) · f (n - 2) (θi) · f (θi) · θi - f (n - 1) (θi) = pc · f (n - 1) (θi) · 1 - 1− (n - 1 p c) · f (n - 1 p c −1) (θi) · f (θi) · θi 0 f (N - 1 p c) (x) dx f2 (n - 1 p c) (θi) + (n - 1) · f (n - 2) (θi) · f (θi) · θi - θi 0 f (n−1 p c) (x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) + (1 - pc) θi− θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (y) dy f (n - 1 p c)(θi) · (n - 1) · f (n - 2) (θi) · f (θi) 82 Esto se simplifica para: 0 = PC · (n - 1 p c) · f (n - 2) (θi)· F (θi) · θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) + (n - 1) · f (n - 2) (θi) · f (θi) · - θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (x) dx f (n - 1 p c) (θi) + (1 - pc) - θi 0 f (n - 1 p c) (y) dyF (n-1 p c) (θi) · (n-1) · f (n-2) (θi) · f (θi) Después de distribuir PC, el lado derecho de esta ecuación se cancela, y tenemosVerificó nuestra estrategia de licitación de equilibrio. Corolario 2. En una subasta de segundo precio en la que el vendedor hace trampa con PC de probabilidad, y F (θi) = θi, es un equilibrio de bayes-Nash para cada agente ofertar de acuerdo con la siguiente estrategia: BI (θi) = n-1 n- 1 + PC θi (6) prueba. Conectando f (θi) = θi en la ecuación 5 (repetido como 12), obtenemos: bi (θi) = θi - θi 0 x (n - 1 p c) dx θi (n - 1 p c) = θi - p cN - 1 + p c θi (n - 1 + p c p c) θi (n - 1 p c) = θi - pc n - 1 + pc · θi = n - 1 n - 1 + pc · θi teorema 3. En una subasta de primer precio en la que cada agente hace trampa con probabilidad PA, es un equilibrio de Bayes-Nash para que cada agente no trato I oferte de acuerdo con la estrategia que es un punto fijo de la siguiente ecuación: BI (θi) =θi - θi 0 pa · f (bi (x)) + (1 - pa) · f (x) (n - 1) dx pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi)(N - 1) (8) Prueba. Hacemos las mismas suposiciones sobre la estrategia de equilibrio para ayudar a nuestra búsqueda como lo hicimos en la prueba del Teorema 1. Al simplificar la expectativa de esta ecuación de utilidad de configuración (7), utilizamos el hecho de que la probabilidad de que el agente tenga una oferta más alta que otro agente honesto todavía es F (φi (bi (θi))), mientras que la probabilidad es F(BI (θi)) Si el otro agente hace trampa. La probabilidad de que el agente I supere a un solo otro agente es un promedio ponderado de estas dos probabilidades. Por lo tanto, podemos escribir el agente de la utilidad como: eθ - i, µA ui (b (θ), µA, θi) = θi - bi (θi) · pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa)· F (φi (bi (θi))) n - 1 Como antes, para encontrar el equilibrio bi (θi), tomamos la derivada y la establecemos en cero: 0 = θi - bi (θi) · (n - 1)· PA · F (BI (θi)) + (1 - PA) · F (φi (BI (θi))) N - 2 · PA · F (BI (θi)) + (1 - PA) · F (φi(bi (θi))) · φi (bi (θi)) - pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (φi (bi (θi))) n - 1 aplicando las ecuaciones φi (bi (θi)) = 1 bi (θi) y φi (bi (θi)) = θi, y dividiendo a través de, produce: 0 = θi - bi (θi) · (n - 1) · pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi) · 1 bi (θi) - pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi) Términos de reorganización de los rendimientos: bi (θi) = θi- PA · F (BI (θi)) + (1 - PA) · F (θi) · Bi (θi) (N - 1) · PA · F (BI (θi)) · Bi (θi) + (1 −PA) · F (θi) (13) En este entorno, porque deja f (·) no especificado, no podemos presentar una solución de forma cerrada. Sin embargo, podemos simplificar la expresión eliminando su dependencia de BI (θi).bi (θi) = θi - θi 0 pa · f (bi (x)) + (1 - pa) · f (x) (n - 1) dx pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pA)· F (θi) (n - 1) (14) para verificar la ecuación 14, primero tome su derivado: bi (θi) = 1 - 1- (n - 1) · pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1− Pa) · f (θi) (n - 2) · pa · f (bi (θi)) · bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi) · θi 0 pa · f (bi (x (x)) + (1 - pa) · f (x) (n - 1) dx pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi) 2 (n - 1) Esta ecuación se simplifica a:bi (θi) = (n −1) · pa · f (bi (θi)) · bi (θi)) +(1 --p) · f (θi) · θi 0 pa · f (bi (x) + +(1 - pa) · f (x) (n - 1) dx pa · f (bi (θi)) + (1 - pa) · f (θi) n conectando esta ecuación al bi (θi) en el numerador deLa ecuación 13 produce la ecuación 14, verificando la solución.83 Corolario 4. En una subasta de primer precio en la que cada agente hace trampa con probabilidad PA, y F (θi) = θi, es un equilibrio de Bayesnash para que cada agente no trato de oferta de acuerdo con la estrategia bi (θi) = n-1 θi. Prueba. Instancializando la ecuación de punto fijo (8, y repetido como 14) con F (θi) = θi rendimientos: BI (θi) = θi - θi 0 Pa · Bi (x) + (1 - PA) · X (N - 1)dx pa · bi (θi) + (1 - pa) · θi (n - 1) Podemos conectar la estrategia bi (θi) = n - 1 n θi en esta ecuación para verificar que es un punto fijo.bi (θi) = θi - θi 0 pa · n - 1 x + (1 - pa) · x (n - 1) dx pa · n - 1 n θi + (1 - pa) · θi (n - 1)= θi - θi 0 x (n - 1) dx θ (n - 1) i = θi - 1 n θn i θ (n - 1) i = n - 1 n θi teorema 5. En una subasta de primer precio donde f (θi) = θi, si cada agente J = I oferta según una estrategia bj (θj) = n-1+αj n θj, donde αj ≥ 0, entonces es una mejor respuesta para elEl agente restante I para ofertar de acuerdo con la estrategia bi (θi) = n - 1 n θi. Prueba. Nuevamente usamos φJ: [0, bj (1)] → [0, 1] como el inverso de BJ (θj). Para todas las j = i en este entorno, φJ (x) = n n - 1+αj x. La probabilidad de que el agente I tenga una oferta más alta que un solo agente J es f (φJ (bi (θi))) = n n - 1+αj bi (θi). Tenga en cuenta, sin embargo, que, dado que φJ (·) solo se define sobre el rango [0, bj (1)], debe ser el caso de que bi (1) ≤ bj (1), por lo que αJ ≥ 0 es necesario,Además de ser suficiente. Suponiendo que Bi (θi) = n - 1 n θi, entonces φJ (bi (θi)) siempre está bien definido. Ahora mostraremos que esta suposición es correcta. La utilidad esperada para el agente I puede escribirse como: eθ - i ui (b (θ), θi) = πj = i n n - 1 + αj bi (θi) · θi −bi (θ) = πj = i n n −1 + αJ · θi · bi (θi) (n - 1) - bi (θi) n tomando el derivado con respecto a bi (θi), estableciéndolo en cero y dividiendo πj = i n n - 1 + αj produce:0 = θi · (n - 1) · bi (θi) (n - 2) - n · bi (θi) (n - 1) Esto se simplifica con la solución: bi (θi) = n - 1 n θi. Versión completa del ejemplo 1: en una subasta de primer precio donde F (θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 y n = 2, si el agente 2 siempre ofrece su tipo (B2 (θ2) = θ2), entonces, para todos θ1>0, la estrategia de licitación de la mejor respuesta del Agente 1 es estrictamente menor que la estrategia de licitación del equilibrio simétrico. Después de calcular el equilibrio simétrico en el que ambos agentes se afeitan su oferta por la misma cantidad, encontramos la mejor respuesta a un agente que en su lugar no afeita su oferta. Luego mostramos que esta mejor respuesta es estrictamente menor que la estrategia de equilibrio. Para encontrar la estrategia de licitación de equilibrio simétrico, instanciamos n = 2 en la fórmula general de la ecuación que se encuentra en [10], enchufe f (θi) = θ2 i +θi 2, y simplifica: bi (θi) = θi - θi 0F (x) dx f (θi) = θi− 1 2 · θi 0 (x2 + x) dx 1 2 · (θ2 i + θi) = θi− 1 3 θ3 i + 1 2 θ2 i θ2 i + θi = 23 θ2 i + 1 2 θi θi + 1 Ahora derivamos la mejor respuesta para el Agente 1 a la estrategia B2 (θ2) = θ2, denotando la mejor estrategia de respuesta B ∗ 1 (θ1) para distinguirla del caso simétrico. La probabilidad de que el agente 1 gane es F (b ∗ 1 (θ1)), que es la probabilidad de que el tipo de agente 2S sea menor que el agente 1 de la oferta. Por lo tanto, la utilidad esperada del Agente 1 es: Eθ2 ui ((b ∗ 1 (θ1), b2 (θ2)), θ1) = f (b ∗ 1 (θ1)) · θ1 - b ∗ 1 (θ1) = (b ∗1 (θ1)) 2 + b ∗ 1 (θ1) 2 · θ1 - b ∗ 1 (θ1) Tomar la derivada con respecto a B ∗ 1 (θ1), configurarlo en cero, y luego reorganizar los términos nos da: 0 = =1 2 · 2 · b ∗ 1 (θ1) · θ1 - 3 · (b ∗ 1 (θ1)) 2 + θ1 - 2 · b ∗ 1 (θ1) 0 = 3 · (b ∗ 1 (θ1) 2 +(2 - 2 · θ1) · B ∗ 1 (θ1) - θ1 De las dos soluciones de esta ecuación, siempre produce una oferta negativa. El otro es: B ∗ 1 (θ1) = θ1 - 1 + θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 3 Ahora necesitamos mostrar que B1 (θ1)> B ∗ 1 (θ1) es válido para todos θi> 0. Sustituyendo en ambos términos, y luego simplificar la desigualdad nos da: 2 3 θ2 1 + 1 2 θ1 θ1 + 1> θ1 - 1 + θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 3 θ2 1 + 3 2 θ1 + 1> (θ1 + 1) θ2 1 + θ1 + 1 Dado que θ1 ≥ 0, podemos cuadrar ambos lados de la desigualdad, lo que nos permite verificar la desigualdad para todos θ1> 0. θ4 1 + 3θ3 1 + 17 4 θ2 1 + 3θ1 + 1>θ4 1 + 3θ3 1 + 4θ2 1 + 3θ1 + 1 1 4 θ2 1> 0 84",

        "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
        "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
        "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
        "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
        "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
        "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
        "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
        "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
        "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
        "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
        "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
        "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
        "A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",
        "This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.",
        "For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.",
        "We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.",
        "However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat).",
        "We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat.",
        "Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.",
        "In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidders value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).",
        "This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.",
        "But why should the seller have all the fun?",
        "In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.",
        "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
        "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",
        "In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.",
        "When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.",
        "This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.",
        "We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the case of a seller cheating in a second price auction.",

        "While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.",
        "Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.",
        "We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1].",

        "Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.",
        "A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.",
        "We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).",
        "We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).",
        "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
        "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
        "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
        "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
        "On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",
        "Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.",
        "The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.",
        "The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.",
        "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",
        "Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
        "A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.",
        "Formally, b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if: ∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗ i (θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi ≥ Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi (4) 2.2 Equilibrium We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary distribution F(·). 4 This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins. 5 Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium. 77 Theorem 1.",
        "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
        "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).",
        "In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.",
        "However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.",
        "The position of Pc is perhaps surprising.",
        "For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions.",
        "Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",
        "By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.",
        "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
        "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
        "Corollary 2.",
        "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.",
        "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
        "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
        "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.",
        "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
        "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
        "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction.",
        "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
        "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
        "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
        "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
        "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
        "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
        "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
        "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
        "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
        "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
        "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
        "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
        "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",

        "Theorem 3.",
        "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
        "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
        "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
        "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
        "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
        "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
        "Corollary 4.",
        "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
        "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
        "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
        "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
        "Theorem 5.",
        "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
        "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
        "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
        "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
        "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
        "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
        "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
        "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
        "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
        "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.",
        "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
        "Example 1.",
        "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
        "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
        "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
        "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
        "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
        "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",
        "We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4.",
        "REVENUE LOSS FOR AN HONEST SELLER In both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating.",
        "The equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us to quantify this loss.",
        "Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.",
        "In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave their bids.",
        "For the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by P c N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest sellers revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.",
        "Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents may cheat is not so straightforward.",
        "If Pa = 1 (each agent cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price auction, and the sellers expected revenue will be unchanged.",

        "However, even in this worst case, the percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than it is for the second-price auction in which Pc = 1 2 , as shown in Table 1.6 It turns out that setting Pc = 0.2 would make the expected loss of these two settings comparable.",
        "While this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.",

        "RELATED WORK Existing work covers another dimension along which we could analyze cheating: altering the perceived value of N. In this paper, we have assumed that N is known by all of the bidders.",
        "However, in an online setting this assumption is rather tenuous.",
        "For example, a bidders only source of information about N could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate.",
        "In these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation.",
        "However, if agents are aware that the seller has this power, then any communication about N to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not credible.",
        "Thus, in equilibrium the agents would ignore the declared value of N, and bid according to their own prior beliefs about the number of agents.",
        "If we make the natural assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed to any of the bidders.",

        "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) Proof.",
        "To find an equilibrium, we start by guessing that there exists an equilibrium in which all agents bid according to the same function bi(θi), because the game is symmetric.",
        "Further, we guess that bi(θi) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the range [0, 1].",
        "We can also assume that bi(0) = 0, because negative bids are not allowed and a positive bid is not rational when the agents valuation is 0.",
        "Note that these are not assumptions on the setting- they are merely limitations that we impose on our search.",
        "Let Φi : [0, bi(1)] → [0, 1] be the inverse function of bi(θi).",
        "That is, it takes a bid for agent i as input and returns the type θi that induced this bid.",
        "Recall Equation 3: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) The probability that a single other bid is below that of agent i is equal to the cdf at the type that would induce a bid equal to that of agent i, which is formally written as F(Φi(bi(θi))).",
        "Since all agents are independent, the probability that all other bids are below agent is is simply this term raised the (N − 1)-th power.",
        "Thus, we can re-write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = FN−1 (Φi(bi(θi)))· θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (9) We now solve for the expected payment.",
        "Plugging Equation 1 (which gives the price for the winning agent) into the term for the expected price in Equation 9, and then simplifying the expectation yields: Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Eθ−i,µc µc · bi(θi) + (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc · bi(θi) + (1 − Pc ) · Eθ−i b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc · bi(θi) + (1 − Pc ) · bi(θi) 0 b[1](θ−i)· pdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) db[1](θ−i) (10) Note that the integral on the last line is taken up to bi(θi) because we are conditioning on the fact that bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i).",

        "Thus, we can write agent is expected utility as: Eθ−i,µa ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θi) · Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 As before, to find the equilibrium bi(θi), we take the derivative and set it to zero: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−2 · Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(Φi(bi(θi))) N−1 Applying the equations Φi(bi(θi)) = 1 bi(θi) and Φi(bi(θi)) = θi, and dividing through, produces: 0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)· Pa · f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(θi) · 1 bi(θi) − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(θi) Rearranging terms yields: bi(θi) = θi − Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) · bi(θi) (N − 1) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · f(θi) (13) In this setting, because we leave F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution.",
        "However, we can simplify the expression by removing its dependence on bi(θi). bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (14) To verify Equation 14, first take its derivative: bi(θi) = 1 − 1− (N − 1) · Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(θi) (N−2) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa ) · f(θi) · θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) 2(N−1) This equation simplifies to: bi(θi) = (N −1)· Pa ·f(bi(θi))·bi(θi))+(1−Pa )·f(θi) · θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa ) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) N Plugging this equation into the bi(θi) in the numerator of Equation 13 yields Equation 14, verifying the solution. 83 Corollary 4.",
        "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",

        "Instantiating the fixed point equation (8, and repeated as 14) with F(θi) = θi yields: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · bi(x) + (1 − Pa ) · x (N−1) dx Pa · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · θi (N−1) We can plug the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi into this equation in order to verify that it is a fixed point. bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · N−1 N x + (1 − Pa ) · x (N−1) dx Pa · N−1 N θi + (1 − Pa) · θi (N−1) = θi − θi 0 x(N−1) dx θ (N−1) i = θi − 1 N θN i θ (N−1) i = N − 1 N θi Theorem 5.",
        "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
        "Proof.",
        "We again use Φj : [0, bj(1)] → [0, 1] as the inverse of bj(θj).",
        "For all j = i in this setting, Φj(x) = N N−1+αj x.",
        "The probability that agent i has a higher bid than a single agent j is F(Φj(bi(θi))) = N N−1+αj bi(θi).",
        "Note, however, that since Φj(·) is only defined over the range [0, bj(1)], it must be the case that bi(1) ≤ bj(1), which is why αj ≥ 0 is necessary, in addition to being sufficient.",
        "Assuming that bi(θi) = N−1 N θi, then indeed Φj(bi(θi)) is always welldefined.",
        "We will now show that this assumption is correct.",

        "Full Version of Example 1: In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
        "After calculating the symmetric equilibrium in which both agents shave their bid by the same amount, we find the best response to an agent who instead does not shave its bid.",
        "We then show that this best response is strictly less than the equilibrium strategy.",
        "To find the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy, we instantiate N = 2 in the general formula the equation found in [10], plug in F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 , and simplify: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F(x)dx F(θi) = θi− 1 2 · θi 0 (x2 + x)dx 1 2 · (θ2 i + θi) = θi− 1 3 θ3 i + 1 2 θ2 i θ2 i + θi = 2 3 θ2 i + 1 2 θi θi + 1 We now derive the best response for agent 1 to the strategy b2(θ2) = θ2, denoting the best response strategy b∗ 1(θ1) to distinguish it from the symmetric case.",
        "The probability of agent 1 winning is F(b∗ 1(θ1)), which is the probability that agent 2s type is less than agent 1s bid.",

                "On Cheating in <br>sealed-bid</br> Auctions Ryan Porter rwporter@stanford.edu Yoav Shoham shoham@stanford.edu Computer Science Department Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305 ABSTRACT Motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative lack of security, this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in <br>sealed-bid</br> auctions.",
                "The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.",
                "In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "These results provide insights into sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Economics, Security 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, <br>sealed-bid</br> auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, <br>sealed-bid</br> auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
                "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
                "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the <br>sealed-bid</br> auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
                "A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",
                "This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.",
                "For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.",
                "We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.",
                "However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat).",
                "We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat.",
                "Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.",
                "In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidders value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).",
                "This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.",
                "But why should the seller have all the fun?",
                "In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.",
                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",
                "In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.",
                "When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.",
                "This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.",
                "We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.",
                "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
                "In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the case of a seller cheating in a second price auction.",
                "Section 3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.",
                "In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings.",
                "We discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6.",
                "All proofs and derivations are found in the appendix. 2.",
                "SECOND-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING SELLER In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after observing all of the bids.",
                "The formulation for this section will be largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating in a first-price auction.",
                "While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.",
                "Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.",
                "We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1].",
                "Call the probability density function (pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.",
                "Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.",
                "A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.",
                "We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).",
                "We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).",
                "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
                "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
                "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
                "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
                "On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",
                "Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.",
                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",
                "Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
                "A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.",
                "Formally, b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if: ∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗ i (θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi ≥ Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi (4) 2.2 Equilibrium We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary distribution F(·). 4 This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins. 5 Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium. 77 Theorem 1.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
                "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).",
                "In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.",
                "However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.",
                "The position of Pc is perhaps surprising.",
                "For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions.",
                "Consider a probabilistic <br>sealed-bid</br> auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",
                "By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Corollary 2.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.",
                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
                "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.",
                "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
                "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
                "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
                "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
                "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
                "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
                "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
                "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
                "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, <br>sealed-bid</br> auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",

                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",

                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",

                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",

                "The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.",
                "In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "These results provide insights into sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.",

                "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
                "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
                "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
                "A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",
                "This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.",
                "For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.",
                "We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.",
                "However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat).",

                "But why should the seller have all the fun?",
                "In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.",
                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",
                "In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.",
                "When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.",
                "This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.",
                "We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.",

                "While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.",
                "Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.",
                "We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1].",
                "Call the probability density function (pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.",
                "Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.",
                "A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.",
                "We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).",
                "We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).",
                "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
                "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
                "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
                "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
                "On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",
                "Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.",
                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",
                "Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
                "A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.",
                "Formally, b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if: ∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗ i (θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi ≥ Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗ −i(θ−i) , µc , θi (4) 2.2 Equilibrium We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an arbitrary distribution F(·). 4 This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve price before the auction begins. 5 Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the existence of an equilibrium. 77 Theorem 1.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
                "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).",
                "In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.",
                "However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.",
                "The position of Pc is perhaps surprising.",
                "For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions.",
                "Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",
                "By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Corollary 2.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.",
                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
                "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.",
                "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
                "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
                "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
                "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
                "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
                "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
                "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
                "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
                "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
                "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
                "Corollary 4.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
                "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
                "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.",
                "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
                "Example 1.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
                "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
                "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
                "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
                "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
                "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",
                "We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4.",

                "Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave their bids.",
                "For the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by P c N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest sellers revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.",

                "For example, a bidders only source of information about N could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate.",
                "In these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation.",

                "While the non-colluding agents would account for this possibility, as long as they are not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did not take place.",

                "In their setting, the seller is a participant in the Bayesian game who decides between running a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never possible) or second-price auction.",

                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining <br>agent</br> to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each <br>agent</br> j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining <br>agent</br> i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each <br>agent</br> j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an <br>agent</br> can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single <br>agent</br> shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single <br>agent</br> js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then <br>agent</br> is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
                "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an <br>agent</br> should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
                "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one <br>agent</br> is to bid his type.",
                "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
                "Example 1.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if <br>agent</br> 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, <br>agent</br> 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
                "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
                "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
                "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
                "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
                "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",
                "We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4.",

                "Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.",

                "While this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that <br>agent</br> suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.",

                "For example, a bidders only source of information about N could be a counter that the seller places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller about the number of potential bidders who have indicated that they will participate.",
                "In these cases, the seller could arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer to their true valuation.",

                "If we make the natural assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed to any of the bidders.",

                "The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.",
                "In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "These results provide insights into sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Economics, Security 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
                "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
                "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
                "A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",
                "This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.",
                "For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.",
                "We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.",
                "However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully cheat).",
                "We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will cheat.",
                "Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.",
                "In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the <br>case</br> in which each bidders value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).",
                "This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.",
                "But why should the seller have all the fun?",
                "In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.",
                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",
                "In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.",
                "When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.",
                "This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.",
                "We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.",
                "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
                "In Section 2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the <br>case</br> of a seller cheating in a second price auction.",
                "Section 3 covers the <br>case</br> of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.",
                "In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings.",
                "We discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6.",

                "SECOND-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING SELLER In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after observing all of the bids.",
                "The formulation for this section will be largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating in a first-price auction.",
                "While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.",
                "Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.",

                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",

                "In a second-price auction in which the <br>seller</br> cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
                "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).",

                "Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the <br>seller</br> is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",

                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Corollary 2.",

                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the <br>seller</br> is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
                "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.",
                "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
                "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
                "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
                "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
                "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
                "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
                "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
                "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
                "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
                "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
                "Corollary 4.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",

                "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
                "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
                "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
                "A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",

                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",

                "Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.",
                "A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.",
                "We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).",
                "We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).",
                "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
                "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
                "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
                "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
                "On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",

                "The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.",
                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",
                "Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",

                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
                "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a <br>first-price auction</br> (see, e.g., [10]).",
                "In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.",
                "However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.",
                "The position of Pc is perhaps surprising.",
                "For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions.",
                "Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",
                "By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Corollary 2.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.",
                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a <br>first-price auction</br>: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "<br>first-price auction</br>, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
                "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a <br>first-price auction</br>.",
                "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
                "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
                "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard <br>first-price auction</br>.",
                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
                "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
                "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
                "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
                "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
                "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
                "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a <br>first-price auction</br> in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a <br>first-price auction</br> without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
                "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
                "Corollary 4.",
                "In a <br>first-price auction</br> in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a <br>first-price auction</br> is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a <br>first-price auction</br> where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
                "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
                "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.",
                "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
                "Example 1.",
                "In a <br>first-price auction</br> where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
                "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
                "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
                "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
                "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
                "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a <br>first-price auction</br> cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",
                "We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4.",

                "Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.",

                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",

                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the <br>payment</br> of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",

                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",

                "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
                "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
                "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
                "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
                "On the other hand, if the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",

                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",

                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",

                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",

                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents cheat.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",

                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the <br>possibility</br> of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
                "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
                "Corollary 4.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
                "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
                "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.",
                "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
                "Example 1.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
                "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
                "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
                "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
                "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
                "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",

                "The first type of cheating we consider occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In the second type, a bidder cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing bids before deciding on his own bid.",
                "In both cases, we derive equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "These results provide insights into sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a first-price auction.",

                "INTRODUCTION Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice, sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they require little communication and can be completed almost instantly.",
                "Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner is immediately determined.",
                "However, sealed-bid auctions do require that the bids be kept private until the auction clears.",
                "The increasing popularity of online auctions only makes this disadvantage more troublesome.",
                "At an auction house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.",
                "However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little more than a server with questionable security; and, since all participants are in different locations, one can anonymously attempt to break into the server.",
                "In this paper, we present a game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on knowledge of the bids.",
                "We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions: whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid auction is used.",
                "Note that two of these cases are trivial.",
                "In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the winning bidder.",
                "In a second-price auction, knowing the competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant strategy to bid truthfully.",
                "This leaves us with two cases that we examine in detail.",
                "A seller can profitably <br>cheat</br> in a second-price auction by looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting an extra bid.",
                "This possibility was pointed out as early as the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.",
                "For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction), then the seller may be able to break into eBays server, observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below it using a false identity.",
                "We assume that there is no chance that the seller will be caught when it cheats.",
                "However, not all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can successfully <br>cheat</br>).",
                "We assume that each bidder knows the probability with which the seller will <br>cheat</br>.",
                "Possible motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e on seller cheating in eBay auctions.",
                "In this setting, we derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each bidders value for the good is independently drawn from a common distribution (with no further assumptions except for continuity and differentiability).",
                "This result shows how first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.",
                "But why should the seller have all the fun?",
                "In a first-price auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he 76 wins.",
                "To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off the probability of winning the auction against how much he will pay if he does win.",
                "Of course, if he could simply examine the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.",
                "In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders.",
                "When bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder.",
                "This result is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.",
                "We conclude this section by exploring other distributions, including some in which the presence of cheating bidders actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.",
                "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",

                "In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings.",

                "While no prior knowledge of game theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can be found in [2] and [6], respectively. 2.1 Formulation The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller.",
                "Each agent has a type θi ∈ [0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the agents value for the good being auctioned.2 Each agents type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.",
                "We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable over the interval [0, 1].",
                "Call the probability density function (pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.",
                "Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the distribution over the possible types of the other agents.",
                "A bidding strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its bid.3 Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents, and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all types except for that of agent i.",
                "We can then combine the vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i).",
                "We also define the vector of bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without 2 We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss of generality because any distribution over a different range can be normalized to this range. 3 We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies, but, because of our continuity assumption, there always exists a pure strategy equilibrium. the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i).",
                "Let b[1](θ) be the value of the highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding definition for b[1](θ−i).",
                "An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation.",
                "Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability event in equilibrium.",
                "We assume that the seller does not set a reserve price.4 If the seller does not <br>cheat</br>, then the winning agent pays the highest bid by another agent.",
                "On the other hand, if the seller does <br>cheat</br>, then the winning agent will pay its bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full advantage of its power.",
                "Let the indicator variable µc be 1 if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The probability that the seller cheats, Pc , is known by all agents.5 We can then write the payment of the winning agent as follows. pi(b(θ), µc ) = µc · bi(θi) − (1 − µc ) · b[1](θ−i) (1) Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.",
                "The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction, and the difference between its valuation and its price if it does. ui(b(θ), µc , θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc ) (2) We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent, with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents and over whether or not the seller cheats.",
                "By pushing the expectation inward so that it is only over the price (conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the expected utility as: Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc , θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc ) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3) We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility maximizers.",
                "Because of the uncertainty over the types of the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.",
                "A vector of bidding strategies b∗ is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi, agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies for all other agents fixed.",

                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 F( N−1 P c ) (x)dx F( N−1 P c ) (θi) (5) It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc .",
                "Setting Pc = 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]).",
                "In the case of Pc = 0, this solution is not defined.",
                "However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc approaches 0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a standard second-price auction.",
                "The position of Pc is perhaps surprising.",
                "For example, the linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc · θi 0 F (N−1) (x)dx F (N−1)(θi) of the equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies for the cases of Pc = 0 and Pc = 1. 2.3 Continuum of Auctions An alternative perspective on the setting is as a continuum between first and second-price auctions.",
                "Consider a probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc it is his bid, and with probability 1 − Pc it is the second-highest bid.",
                "By adjusting Pc , we can smoothly move between a first and second-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, the fact that this probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix). 2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by instantiating the distribution of types.",
                "We now consider the often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Corollary 2.",
                "In a second-price auction in which the seller cheats with probability Pc , and F(θi) = θi, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to the following strategy: bi(θi) = N − 1 N − 1 + Pc θi (6) This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc , can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known results.",
                "When Pc = 0 the bidding strategy is now welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc = 1 we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi. 3.",
                "FIRST-PRICE AUCTION, CHEATING AGENTS We now consider the case in which the seller is honest, but there is a chance that agents will <br>cheat</br> and examine the other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively, they will revise their bid before the auction clears).",
                "Since this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction, we only analyze the case of a first-price auction.",
                "After revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an arbitrary distribution F(·).",
                "This equation will be useful for the analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the possibility of cheating agents does not change the equilibrium strategy of honest agents.",
                "This result has implications for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to overbidding in a standard first-price auction.",
                "Furthermore, we find that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a competing agent to shave more off of its bid. 3.1 Formulation It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid (up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win the auction.",
                "It is less obvious, though, what will happen if multiple agents <br>cheat</br>.",
                "One could imagine a scenario similar to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good at the current winning bid.",
                "However, we are only concerned with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware of the possibility of cheating.",
                "Thus, it suffices for an honest agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if its bid exceeds every other honest agents bid and every cheating agents type.",
                "This intuition can be formalized as the following discriminatory auction.",
                "In the first stage, each agents payment rule is determined.",
                "With probability Pa , the agent will pay the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially, he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.",
                "These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator variables µa = (µa1 , . . . , µan ), where µai = 1 denotes that agent i pays the second highest bid.",
                "Each agent knows the probability Pa , but does not know the payment rule for all other agents.",
                "Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid auction.",
                "It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid its true type, making this formulation strategically equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph.",
                "The expression for the utility of an honest agent in this discriminatory auction is as follows. ui(b(θ), µa , θi) = θi − bi(θ) · j=i µaj · µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj ) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj) (7) 3.2 Equilibrium Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.",
                "Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a closed form solution for the honest agents bidding strategy, and instead give a fixed point equation for it.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy that is a fixed point of the following equation: bi(θi) = θi − θi 0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x) (N−1) dx Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) (N−1) (8) 78 3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case, we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).",
                "A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.",
                "Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1 N θi is the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given that the other agents are bidding according to the same strategy.",
                "Since in the current setting the cheating agents do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest agents probability of winning (while obviously not affecting the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by increasing his bid.",
                "The idea is that sacrificing some potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into balance.",
                "However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding strategy is unchanged.",
                "Corollary 4.",
                "In a first-price auction in which each agent cheats with probability Pa , and F(θi) = θi, it is a BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always bidding their type.",
                "In fact, as long as all other agents shave their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no greater than 1 N , it is still a best response for the remaining agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy.",
                "Note that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding above their type.",
                "Theorem 5.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) = N−1+αj N θj, where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1 N θi.",
                "Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set αj = 0.",
                "The point of this theorem is that a wide range of possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium strategy.",
                "This is important because a common (and valid) criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.",
                "However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed converge on this equilibrium.",
                "It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off of its bid.",
                "In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent js strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then agent is best response is to shave more than 1 N off of its bid. 3.4 Effects of Overbidding for Other Distributions A natural question is whether the best response bidding strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing agents for other distributions.",
                "It turns out that Theorem 5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k , where k is some positive integer.",
                "However, taking a simple linear combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 yields a distribution in which an agent should actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids less.",
                "In the example we present for this distribution (with the details in the appendix), there are only two players and the deviation by one agent is to bid his type.",
                "However, it can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other deviations.",
                "Example 1.",
                "In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θ2 i +θi 2 and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1s best response bidding strategy is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.",
                "We also note that the same result holds for the normalized exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1 e−1 ).",
                "It is certainly the case that distributions can be found that support the intuition given above that agents should shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.",
                "Examples include F(θi) = −1 2 θ2 i + 3 2 θi (the solution to the system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1), and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi) e−1 .",
                "It would be useful to relate the direction of the change in the best response bidding strategy to a general condition on F(·).",
                "Unfortunately, we were not able to find such a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).",
                "We do note, however, that the sign of the second derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the distributions that we considered. 4.",

                "The equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us to quantify this loss.",
                "Although this is as far as we will take the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings, in which the seller could, for example, choose the market in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to oversee the auction.",

                "For the case in which agent types are drawn from the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by P c N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest sellers revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.",
                "Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents may <br>cheat</br> is not so straightforward.",
                "If Pa = 1 (each agent cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price auction, and the sellers expected revenue will be unchanged.",
                "Again considering the uniform distribution for agent types, it is not surprising that Pa = 1 2 causes the seller to lose 79 the most revenue.",
                "However, even in this worst case, the percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than it is for the second-price auction in which Pc = 1 2 , as shown in Table 1.6 It turns out that setting Pc = 0.2 would make the expected loss of these two settings comparable.",
                "While this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than agents actually cheating themselves.",
