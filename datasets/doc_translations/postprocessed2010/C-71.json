INTRODUCTION A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of in-situ battery-powered sensor nodes. A WSN can collect the data about physical phenomena of interest [1]. There are many potential applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring and surveillance, etc. [1][11]. In many application scenarios, WSNs are employed to conduct surveillance tasks in adverse, or even worse, in hostile working environments. One major problem caused is that sensor nodes are subjected to failures. Therefore, fault tolerance of a WSN is critical. One way to achieve fault tolerance is that a WSN should contain a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures. It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be working in sleeping mode (i.e., major power-consuming units such as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be shut off) to save energy, and thus to prolong the network lifetime. Redundancy should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area [6]. We find that the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points serves as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points. We call this index, denoted by ι, the normalized minimum distance. If points are moveable, we find that maximizing ι results in a honeycomb structure. The honeycomb structure poses that the coverage efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that is providing surveillance work. Employing ι in coverage-related problems is thus deemed promising. This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area. To explore the effectiveness of employing ι in coverage-related problems, we formulate a sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy WSNs. An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area. We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a novel index ι for evaluation of point-distribution. We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the network. Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model. With the MIND algorithm we show that locally maximizing ι among each sensor node and its neighbors is a good approach to solve this problem. This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coveragerelated problems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our point-distribution index ι. We survey related work and formulate a sensor-grouping problem together with a general sensing model in Section 3. Section 4 investigates the application of ι in this grouping problem. We propose MIND for this problem 1171 and introduce ICQA as a benchmark. In Section 5, we present our simulation results in which MIND and ICQA are compared. Section 6 provides conclusion remarks. 2. THE NORMALIZED MINIMUM DISTANCE ι: A POINT-DISTRIBUTION INDEX Suppose there are n points in a Euclidean space Ω. The coordinates of these points are denoted by xi (i = 1, ..., n). It may be necessary to evaluate how the distribution of these points is. There are many metrics to achieve this goal. For example, the Mean Square Error from these points to their mean value can be employed to calculate how these points deviate from their mean (i.e., their central). In resource-sharing evaluation, the Global Fairness Index (GFI) is often employed to measure how even the resource distributes among these points [8], when xi represents the amount of resource that belong to point i. In WSNs, GFI is usually used to calculate how even the remaining energy of sensor nodes is. When n is larger than 2 and the points do not all overlap (That points all overlap means xi = xj, ∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n). We propose a novel index called the normalized minimum distance, namely ι, to evaluate the distribution of the points. ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points. It is calculated by: ι = min(||xi − xj||) µ (∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n; and i = j) (1) where ||xi − xj|| denotes the Euclidean distance between point i and point j in Ω, the min(·) function calculates the minimum distance between each pair of points, and µ is the average distance between each pair of points, which is: µ = ( Pn i=1 Pn j=1,j=i ||xi − xj||) n(n − 1) (2) ι measures how well the points separate from one another. Obviously, ι is in interval [0, 1]. ι is equal to 1 if and only if n is equal to 3 and these three points forms an equilateral triangle. ι is equal to zero if any two points overlap. ι is a very interesting value of a set of points. If we consider each xi (∀i = 1, ..., n) is a variable in Ω, how these n points would look like if ι is maximized? An algorithm is implemented to generate the topology in which ι is locally maximized (The algorithm can be found in [19]). We consider a 2-dimensional space. We select n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 and perform this algorithm. In order to avoid that the algorithm converge to local optimum, we select different random seeds to generate the initial points for 1000 time and obtain the best one that results in the largest ι when the algorithm converges. Figure 1 demonstrates what the resulting topology looks like when n = 20 as an example. Suppose each point represents a sensor node. If the sensor coverage model is the Boolean coverage model [15][17][18][14] and the coverage radius of each node is the same. It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node) is a honeycomb-like structure1 . This enlightens us that ι may be employed to solve problems related to sensor-coverage of an area. In WSNs, it is desirable 1 This is how base stations of a wireless cellular network are deployed and why such a network is called a cellular one. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 X Y Figure 1: Node Number = 20, ι = 0.435376 that the active sensor nodes that are performing surveillance task should separate from one another. Under the constraint that the sensing area should be covered, the more each node separates from the others, the less the redundancy of the coverage is. ι indicates the quality of such separation. It should be useful for approaches on sensor-coverage related problems. In our following discussions, we will show the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem. 3. THE SENSOR-GROUPING PROBLEM In many application scenarios, to achieve fault tolerance, a WSN contains a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures. A node sleeping-working schedule scheme is therefore highly desired to exploit the redundancy of working sensors and let as many nodes as possible sleep. Much work in the literature is on this issue [6]. Yan et al introduced a differentiated service in which a sensor node finds out its responsible working duration with cooperation of its neighbors to ensure the coverage of sampled points [17]. Ye et al developed PEAS in which sensor nodes wake up randomly over time, probe their neighboring nodes, and decide whether they should begin to take charge of surveillance work [18]. Xing et al exploited a probabilistic distributed detection model with a protocol called Coordinating Grid (Co-Grid) [16]. Wang et al designed an approach called Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) which introduced the notion that the coverage degree of intersection-points of the neighboring nodes sensing-perimeters indicates the coverage of a convex region [15]. In our recent work [7], we also provided a sleeping configuration protocol, namely SSCP, in which sleeping eligibility of a sensor node is determined by a local Voronoi diagram. SSCP can provide different levels of redundancy to maintain different requirements of fault tolerance. The major feature of the aforementioned protocols is that they employ online distributed and localized algorithms in which a sensor node determines its sleeping eligibility and/or sleeping time based on the coverage requirement of its sensing area with some information provided by its neighbors. Another major approach for sensor node sleeping-working scheduling issue is to group sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in a network are divided into several disjoint sets. Each set of sensor nodes are able to maintain the required area surveillance work. The sensor nodes are scheduled according to which set they belong to. These sets work successively. Only one set of sensor nodes work at any time. We call the issue sensor-grouping problem. The major advantage of this approach is that it avoids the overhead caused by the processes of coordination of sensor nodes to make decision on whether a sensor node is a candidate to sleep or 1172 work and how long it should sleep or work. Such processes should be performed from time to time during the lifetime of a network in many online distributed and localized algorithms. The large overhead caused by such processes is the main drawback of the online distributed and localized algorithms. On the contrary, roughly speaking, this approach groups sensor nodes in one time and schedules when each set of sensor nodes should be on duty. It does not require frequent decision-making on working/sleeping eligibility2 . In [13] by Slijepcevic et al, the sensing area is divided into regions. Sensor nodes are grouped with the most-constrained leastconstraining algorithm. It is a greedy algorithm in which the priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by this sensor. In [5] by Cardei et al, disjoint sensor sets are modeled as disjoint dominating sets. Although maximum dominating sets computation is NP-complete, the authors proposed a graphcoloring based algorithm. Cardei et al also studied similar problem in the domain of covering target points in [4]. The NP-completeness of the problem is proved and a heuristic that computes the sets are proposed. These algorithms are centralized solutions of sensorgrouping problem. However, global information (e.g., the location of each in-network sensor node) of a large scale WSN is also very expensive to obtained online. Also it is usually infeasible to obtain such information before sensor nodes are deployed. For example, sensor nodes are usually deployed in a random manner and the location of each in-network sensor node is determined only after a node is deployed. The solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on locally obtainable information of a sensor node. That is to say, nodes should determine which group they should join in a fully distributed way. Here locally obtainable information refers to a nodes local information and the information that can be directly obtained from its adjacent nodes, i.e., nodes within its communication range. In Subsection 3.1, we provide a general problem formulation of the sensor-grouping problem. Distributed-solution requirement is formulated in this problem. It is followed by discussion in Subsection 3.2 on a general sensing model, which serves as a given condition of the sensor-grouping problem formulation. To facilitate our discussions, the notations in our following discussions are described as follows. • n: The number in-network sensor nodes. • S(j) (j = 1, 2, ..., m): The jth set of sensor nodes where m is the number of sets. • L(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., n): The physical location of node i. • φ: The area monitored by the network: i.e., the sensing area of the network. • R: The sensing radius of a sensor node. We assume that a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular area centered at the node with a radius equal to R. This is a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems. We call this circular area the sensing area of a node. 3.1 Problem Formulation We assume that each sensor node can know its approximate physical location. The approximate location information is obtainable if each sensor node carries a GPS receiver or if some localization algorithms are employed (e.g., [3]). 2 Note that if some nodes die, a re-grouping process might also be performed to exploit the remaining nodes in a set of sensor nodes. How to provide this mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper and yet to be explored. Problem 1. Given: • The set of each sensor node is sensing neighbors N(i) and the location of each member in N(i); • A sensing model which quantitatively describes how a point P in area φ is covered by sensor nodes that are responsible to monitor this point. We call this quantity the coverage quality of P. • The coverage quality requirement in φ, denoted by s. When the coverage of a point is larger than this threshold, we say this point is covered. For each sensor node i, make a decision on which group S(j) it should join so that: • Area φ can be covered by sensor nodes in each set S(j) • m, the number of sets S(j) is maximized. In this formulation, we call sensor nodes within a circular area centered at a sensor node i with a radius equal to 2 · R the sensing neighbors of node i. This is because sensors nodes in this area, together with node i, may be cooperative to ensure the coverage of a point inside node is sensing area. We assume that the communication range of a sensor node is larger than 2 · R, which is also a general assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems. That is to say, the first given condition in Problem 1 is the information that can be obtained directly from a nodes adjacent nodes. It is therefore locally obtainable information. The last two given conditions in this problem formulation can be programmed into a node before it is deployed or by a node-programming protocol (e.g., [9]) during network runtime. Therefore, the given conditions can all be easily obtained by a sensor-grouping scheme with fully distributed implementation. We reify this problem with a realistic sensing model in next subsection. 3.2 A General Sensing Model As WSNs are usually employed to monitor possible events in a given area, it is therefore a design requirement that an event occurring in the network area must/may be successfully detected by sensors. This issue is usually formulated as how to ensure that an event signal omitted in an arbitrary point in the network area can be detected by sensor nodes. Obviously, a sensing model is required to address this problem so that how a point in the network area is covered can be modeled and quantified. Thus the coverage quality of a WSN can be evaluated. Different applications of WSNs employ different types of sensors, which surely have widely different theoretical and physical characteristics. Therefore, to fulfill different application requirements, different sensing models should be constructed based on the characteristics of the sensors employed. A simple theoretical sensing model is the Boolean sensing model [15][18][17][14]. Boolean sensing model assumes that a sensor node can always detect an event occurring in its responsible sensing area. But most sensors detect events according to the signal strength sensed. Event signals usually fade in relation to the physical distance between an event and the sensor. The larger the distance, the weaker the event signals that can be sensed by the sensor, which results in a reduction of the probability that the event can be successfully detected by the sensor. As in WSNs, event signals are usually electromagnetic, acoustic, or photic signals, they fade exponentially with the increasing of 1173 their transmit distance. Specifically, the signal strength E(d) of an event that is received by a sensor node satisfies: E(d) = α dβ (3) where d is the physical distance from the event to the sensor node; α is related to the signal strength omitted by the event; and β is signal fading factor which is typically a positive number larger than or equal to 2. Usually, α and β are considered as constants. Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12]. ∀j = 1, ..., i; L(kj) − L < R. (4) C(L) = iX j=1 (E( L(kj) − L ) > s. (5) C(L) is regarded as the coverage quality of location L in the network area [7][10][12]. However, we notice that defining the sensibility as the sum of the sensed signal strength by each collaborative sensor implies a very special application: Applications must employ the sum of the signal strength to achieve decision-making. To capture generally realistic application requirement, we modify the definition described in Equation (5). The model we adopt in this paper is described in details as follows. We consider the probability P(L, kj ) that an event located at L can be detected by sensor kj is related to the signal strength sensed by kj. Formally, P(L, kj) = γE(d) = δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β , (6) where γ is a constant and δ = γα is a constant too. normalizes the distance to a proper scale and the +1 item is to avoid infinite value of P(L, kj). The probability that an event located at L can be detected by any collaborative sensors that satisfied Equation (4) is: P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 (1 − P(L, kj )). (7) As the detection probability P (L) reasonably determines how an event occurring at location L can be detected by the networks, it is a good measure of the coverage quality of location L in a WSN. Specifically, Equation (5) is modified to: C(L) = P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 [1 − δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β ] > s. (8) To sum it up, we consider a point at location L is covered if Equation (4) and (8) hold. 4. MAXIMIZING-ι NODE-DEDUCTION ALGORITHM FOR SENSOR-GROUPING PROBLEM Before we process to introduce algorithms to solve the sensor grouping problem, let us define the margin (denoted by θ) of an area φ monitored by the network as the band-like marginal area of φ and all the points on the outer perimeter of θ is ρ distance away from all the points on the inner perimeter of θ. ρ is called the margin length. In a practical network, sensor nodes are usually evenly deployed in the network area. Obviously, the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring in the margin of the network is smaller than the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring in other area of the network. Based on this consideration, in our algorithm design, we ensure the coverage quality of the network area except the margin. The information on φ and ρ is networkbased. Each in-network sensor node can be pre-programmed or on-line informed about φ and ρ, and thus calculate whether a point in its sensing area is in the margin or not. 4.1 Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction Algorithm The node-deduction process of our Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction Algorithm (MIND) is simple. A node i greedily maximizes ι of the sub-network composed by itself, its ungrouped sensing neighbors, and the neighbors that are in the same group of itself. Under the constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be ensured, node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one. The candidate to be pruned satisfies that: • It is an ungrouped node. • The deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points inside the sensing area of i. A candidate is deleted if the deletion of the candidate results in largest ι of the sub-network compared to the deletion of other candidates. This node-deduction process continues until no candidate can be found. Then all the ungrouped sensing neighbors that are not deleted are grouped into the same group of node i. We call the sensing neighbors that are in the same group of node i the group sensing neighbors of node i. We then call node i a finished node, meaning that it has finished the above procedure and the sensing area of the node is covered. Those nodes that have not yet finished this procedure are called unfinished nodes. The above procedure initiates at a random-selected node that is not in the margin. The node is grouped to the first group. It calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above procedure. It informs these group sensing neighbors that they are selected in the group. Then it hands over the above procedure to an unfinished group sensing neighbors that is the farthest from itself. This group sensing neighbor continues this procedure until no unfinished neighbor can be found. Then the first group is formed (Algorithmic description of this procedure can be found at [19]). After a group is formed, another random-selected ungrouped node begins to group itself to the second group and initiates the above procedure. In this way, groups are formed one by one. When a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin, cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops. MIND is based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes. It is a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of Problem 1. 4.2 Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm: A Benchmark for MIND To evaluate the effectiveness of introducing ι in the sensor-group problem, another algorithm for sensor-group problem called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) is designed. Our aim 1174 is to evaluate how an idea, i.e., MIND, based on locally maximize ι performs. In ICQA, a node-selecting process is as follows. A node i greedily selects an ungrouped sensing neighbor in the same group as itself one by one, and informs the neighbor it is selected in the group. The criterion is: • The selected neighbor is responsible to provide surveillance work for some uncovered parts of node is sensing area. (i.e., the coverage quality requirement of the parts is not fulfilled if this neighbor is not selected.) • The selected neighbor results in highest improvement of the coverage quality of the neighbors sensing area. The improvement of the coverage quality, mathematically, should be the integral of the the improvements of all points inside the neighbors sensing area. A numerical approximation is employed to calculate this improvement. Details are presented in our simulation study. This node-selecting process continues until the sensing area of node i is entirely covered. In this way, node is group sensing neighbors are found. The above procedure is handed over as what MIND does and new groups are thus formed one by one. And the condition that ICQA stops is the same as MIND. ICQA is also based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes. ICQA is also a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of Problem 1. 5. SIMULATION RESULTS To evaluate the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem, we build simulation surveillance networks. We employ MIND and ICQA to group the in-network sensor nodes. We compare the grouping results with respect to how many groups both algorithms find and how the performance of the resulting groups are. Detailed settings of the simulation networks are shown in Table 1. In simulation networks, sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a uniform manner in the network area. Table 1: The settings of the simulation networks Area of sensor field 400m*400m ρ 20m R 80m α, β, γ and 1.0, 2.0, 1.0 and 100.0 s 0.6 For evaluating the coverage quality of the sensing area of a node, we divide the sensing area of a node into several regions and regard the coverage quality of the central point in each region as a representative of the coverage quality of the region. This is a numerical approximation. Larger number of such regions results in better approximation. As sensor nodes are with low computational capacity, there is a tradeoff between the number of such regions and the precision of the resulting coverage quality of the sensing area of a node. In our simulation study, we set this number 12. For evaluating the improvement of coverage quality in ICQA, we sum up all the improvements at each region-center as the total improvement. 5.1 Number of Groups Formed by MIND and ICQA We set the total in-network node number to different values and let the networks perform MIND and ICQA. For each n, simulations run with several random seeds to generate different networks. Results are averaged. Figure 2 shows the group numbers found in networks with different ns. 500 1000 1500 2000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Total in−network node number Totalnumberofgroupsfound ICQA MMNP Figure 2: The number of groups found by MIND and ICQA We can see that MIND always outperforms ICQA in terms of the number of groups formed. Obviously, the larger the number of groups can be formed, the more the redundancy of each group is exploited. This output shows that an approach like MIND that aim to maximize ι of the resulting topology can exploits redundancy well. As an example, in case that n = 1500, the results of five networks are listed in Table 2. Table 2: The grouping results of five networks with n = 1500 Net MIND ICQA MIND ICQA Group Number Group Number Average ι Average ι 1 34 31 0.145514 0.031702 2 33 30 0.145036 0.036649 3 33 31 0.156483 0.033578 4 32 31 0.152671 0.029030 5 33 32 0.146560 0.033109 The difference between the average ι of the groups in each network shows that groups formed by MIND result in topologies with larger ιs. It demonstrates that ι is good indicator of redundancy in different networks. 5.2 The Performance of the Resulting Groups Although MIND forms more groups than ICQA does, which implies longer lifetime of the networks, another importance consideration is how these groups formed by MIND and ICQA perform. We let 10000 events randomly occur in the network area except the margin. We compare how many events happen at the locations where the quality is less than the requirement s = 0.6 when each resulting group is conducting surveillance work (We call the number of such events the failure number of group). Figure 3 shows the average failure numbers of the resulting groups when different node numbers are set. We can see that the groups formed by MIND outperform those formed by ICQA because the groups formed by MIND result in lower failure numbers. This further demonstrates that MIND is a good approach for sensor-grouping problem. 1175 500 1000 1500 2000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Total in−network node number averagefailurenumbers ICQA MMNP Figure 3: The failure numbers of MIND and ICQA 6. CONCLUSION This paper proposes ι, a novel index for evaluation of pointdistribution. ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points. We find that a set of points that achieve a maximum value of ι result in a honeycomb structure. We propose that ι can serve as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points, which can be employed in coverage-related problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We set out to validate this idea by employing ι to a sensorgrouping problem. We formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model. With an algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND), we show that maximizing ι at sensor nodes is a good approach to solve this problem. Simulation results verify that MIND outperforms a greedy algorithm that exploits sensor-redundancy we design in terms of the number and the performance of the groups formed. This demonstrates a good application of employing ι in coverage-related problems. 7.

Introducción Una red de sensores inalámbricos (WSN) consiste en una gran cantidad de nodos de sensores de batería in situ. Un WSN puede recopilar los datos sobre fenómenos físicos de interés [1]. Hay muchas aplicaciones potenciales de WSN, incluida la monitorización ambiental y la vigilancia, etc. [1] [11]. En muchos escenarios de aplicación, los WSN se emplean para realizar tareas de vigilancia en entornos de trabajo hostiles, o peor, en entornos de trabajo hostiles. Un problema importante causado es que los nodos sensores están sujetos a fallas. Por lo tanto, la tolerancia a fallas de un WSN es crítica. Una forma de lograr la tolerancia a las fallas es que un WSN debe contener una gran cantidad de nodos redundantes para tolerar las fallas de nodo. Es vital proporcionar un mecanismo de que los nodos redundantes puedan estar funcionando en modo de sueño (es decir, las principales unidades que consumen energía, como el transceptor de un nodo sensor redundante, se pueden apagar) para ahorrar energía y, por lo tanto, prolongar la vida útil de la red. La redundancia debe explotarse tanto como sea posible para el conjunto de sensores que actualmente se están haciendo cargo en el trabajo de vigilancia del área de la red [6]. Encontramos que la distancia mínima entre cada par de puntos normalizados por la distancia promedio entre cada par de puntos sirve como un buen índice para evaluar la distribución de los puntos. Llamamos a este índice, denotado por ι, la distancia mínima normalizada. Si los puntos son móviles, encontramos que maximizar ι da como resultado una estructura de panal. La estructura de panal plantea que la eficiencia de cobertura es la mejor si cada punto representa un nodo sensor que proporciona trabajo de vigilancia. Emplear ι en problemas relacionados con la cobertura se considera prometedor. Esto nos ilumina que maximizar ι es un buen enfoque para seleccionar un conjunto de sensores que actualmente se están haciendo cargo en el trabajo de vigilancia del área de la red. Para explorar la efectividad del empleo de ι en problemas relacionados con la cobertura, formulamos un problema de agrupación de sensores para WSN de alta redundancia. Se propone un algoritmo llamado Deducción de nodo Maximizing-ι en el que se eliminan los nodos de sensores redundantes para obtener un gran ι para cada conjunto de sensores que actualmente se hacen cargo del trabajo de vigilancia del área de la red. También presentamos otra solución codiciosa llamada Algoritmo de calidad de cobertura incremental (ICQA) para este problema, que sirve como un punto de referencia para evaluar la mente. La principal contribución de este documento es doble. Primero, presentamos un índice novedoso ι para la evaluación de la distribución de puntos. Mostramos que maximizar ι de un WSN da como resultado una baja redundancia de la red. En segundo lugar, formulamos un problema general de grupos de sensores para WSN y proporcionamos un modelo de detección general. Con el algoritmo mental mostramos que maximizar localmente ι entre cada nodo del sensor y sus vecinos es un buen enfoque para resolver este problema. Esto demuestra una buena aplicación para emplear ι en problemas de coveragereled. El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos nuestro índice de distribución de puntos ι. Encuestamos el trabajo relacionado y formulamos un problema de cultivo de sensores junto con un modelo de detección general en la Sección 3. La Sección 4 investiga la aplicación de ι en este problema de agrupación. Proponemos la mente para este problema 1171 e presentamos ICQA como un punto de referencia. En la Sección 5, presentamos nuestros resultados de simulación en los que se comparan Mind y ICIQA. La Sección 6 proporciona comentarios de conclusión.2. La distancia mínima normalizada ι: un índice de distribución de puntos supone que hay N puntos en un espacio euclidiano Ω. Las coordenadas de estos puntos se denotan por Xi (i = 1, ..., n). Puede ser necesario evaluar cómo es la distribución de estos puntos. Hay muchas métricas para lograr este objetivo. Por ejemplo, el error cuadrado medio de estos puntos a su valor medio se puede emplear para calcular cómo estos puntos se desvían de su media (es decir, su central). En la evaluación de los recursos para compartir, el índice de justicia global (GFI) a menudo se emplea para medir cómo incluso el recurso se distribuye entre estos puntos [8], cuando Xi representa la cantidad de recursos que pertenecen al punto i. En WSNS, GFI generalmente se usa para calcular cómo es incluso la energía restante de los nodos sensores. Cuando n es mayor que 2 y los puntos no se superponen (que los puntos se superponen significan xi = xj, ∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n). Proponemos un índice novedoso llamado la distancia mínima normalizada, a saber ι, para evaluar la distribución de los puntos.ι es la distancia mínima entre cada par de puntos normalizados por la distancia promedio entre cada par de puntos. Se calcula por: ι = min (|| xi - xj ||) µ (∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n; e i = j) (1) donde || xi - xj ||Denota la distancia euclidiana entre el punto I y el punto J En Ω, la función min (·) calcula la distancia mínima entre cada par de puntos, y µ es la distancia promedio entre cada par de puntos, que es: µ = (Pn i =1 pn j = 1, j = i || xi - xj ||) n (n - 1) (2) ι mide qué tan bien se separan entre sí. Obviamente, ι está en intervalo [0, 1].ι es igual a 1 si y solo si n es igual a 3 y estos tres puntos forman un triángulo equilibrado.ι es igual a cero si dos puntos se superponen.ι es un valor muy interesante de un conjunto de puntos. Si consideramos cada xi (∀i = 1, ..., n) es una variable en Ω, ¿cómo se verían estos n puntos si se maximiza ι? Se implementa un algoritmo para generar la topología en la que ι se maximiza localmente (el algoritmo se puede encontrar en [19]). Consideramos un espacio bidimensional. Seleccionamos n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 y realizamos este algoritmo. Para evitar que el algoritmo convergue al óptimo local, seleccionamos diferentes semillas aleatorias para generar los puntos iniciales durante 1000 tiempo y obtener el mejor que resulte en el más grande ι cuando el algoritmo converge. La Figura 1 demuestra cómo se ve la topología resultante cuando n = 20 como ejemplo. Supongamos que cada punto representa un nodo del sensor. Si el modelo de cobertura del sensor es el modelo de cobertura booleana [15] [17] [18] [14] y el radio de cobertura de cada nodo es el mismo. Es emocionante ver que esta topología da como resultado una redundancia más baja porque el diagrama de Vonoroi [2] formado por estos nodos (un diagrama de Vonoroi formado por un conjunto de nodos divide un espacio en un conjunto de polígonos convexos de tal manera que los puntos dentro de un polígono están más cercasolo a un nodo en particular) es una estructura de panal 1. Esto nos ilumina que puede estar empleado para resolver problemas relacionados con la cobertura del sensor de un área. En WSNS, es deseable 1 Así es como se implementan las estaciones base de una red celular inalámbrica y por qué dicha red se llama celular.0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 X Y Figura 1: Número de nodo = 20, ι = 0.435376 que los nodos del sensor activo que realizan una tarea de vigilancia deberían separarse entre sí. Bajo la restricción de que el área de detección debe estar cubierta, cuanto más se separa cada nodo de los demás, menos es la redundancia de la cobertura.ι indica la calidad de tal separación. Debería ser útil para los enfoques sobre problemas relacionados con la cobertura del sensor. En nuestras siguientes discusiones, mostraremos la efectividad del empleo de ι en el problema de grupos de sensores.3. El problema de cultivo de sensores en muchos escenarios de aplicación, para lograr la tolerancia a las fallas, un WSN contiene una gran cantidad de nodos redundantes para tolerar las fallas de nodos. Por lo tanto, un esquema de programación de trabajo para dormir del nodo es muy deseado para explotar la redundancia de los sensores de trabajo y dejar que tantos nodos duerma. Mucho trabajo en la literatura es sobre este tema [6]. Yan et al introdujeron un servicio diferenciado en el que un nodo sensor descubre su duración de trabajo responsable con la cooperación de sus vecinos para garantizar la cobertura de los puntos muestreados [17]. Ye et al desarrollaron guisantes en los que los nodos sensores se despiertan al azar con el tiempo, sondean sus nodos vecinos y deciden si deben comenzar a hacerse cargo del trabajo de vigilancia [18]. Xing et al explotaron un modelo de detección distribuida probabilística con un protocolo llamado Grid de coordinación (Co-Grid) [16]. Wang et al diseñaron un enfoque llamado Protocolo de configuración de cobertura (CCP) que introdujo la noción de que el grado de cobertura de los puntos de intersección de los perímetros de detección de nodos vecinos indica la cobertura de una región convexa [15]. En nuestro trabajo reciente [7], también proporcionamos un protocolo de configuración para dormir, a saber, SSCP, en el que la elegibilidad para dormir de un nodo sensor está determinada por un diagrama local de Voronoi. SSCP puede proporcionar diferentes niveles de redundancia para mantener diferentes requisitos de tolerancia a fallas. La característica principal de los protocolos antes mencionados es que emplean algoritmos distribuidos y localizados en línea en los que un nodo sensor determina su elegibilidad para dormir y/o tiempo de sueño en función del requisito de cobertura de su área de detección con alguna información proporcionada por sus vecinos. Otro enfoque importante para el problema de programación del nodo del nodo del sensor es agrupar los nodos del sensor. Los nodos sensores en una red se dividen en varios conjuntos de disjunto. Cada conjunto de nodos sensores puede mantener el trabajo de vigilancia del área requerido. Los nodos del sensor están programados según el conjunto al que pertenecen. Estos conjuntos funcionan sucesivamente. Solo un conjunto de nodos de sensor funcionan en cualquier momento. Llamamos el problema de los grupos de sensores del problema. La principal ventaja de este enfoque es que evita la sobrecarga causada por los procesos de coordinación de los nodos sensores para tomar una decisión sobre si un nodo del sensor es un candidato para dormir o 1172 y cuánto tiempo debe dormir o trabajar. Dichos procesos deben realizarse de vez en cuando durante la vida útil de una red en muchos algoritmos distribuidos y localizados en línea. La gran sobrecarga causada por tales procesos es el principal inconveniente de los algoritmos distribuidos y localizados en línea. Por el contrario, más o menos, este enfoque agrupa los nodos sensores en un momento y horarios cuando cada conjunto de nodos de sensor debería estar de servicio. No requiere una toma de decisiones frecuente sobre la elegibilidad para el trabajo/sueño2. En [13] por Slijepcevic et al, el área de detección se divide en regiones. Los nodos sensores se agrupan con el algoritmo de mínimes mínimos más restringidos. Es un algoritmo codicioso en el que la prioridad de seleccionar un sensor dado está determinada por cuántas regiones descubiertas cubre este sensor y la redundancia causada por este sensor. En [5] por Cardei et al, los conjuntos de sensores disjuntos se modelan como conjuntos dominantes de disjunto. Aunque el cálculo máximo de conjuntos dominantes es NP-completado, los autores propusieron un algoritmo basado en grafatina. Cargoi et al también estudiaron un problema similar en el dominio de cubrir los puntos objetivo en [4]. Se demuestra la completitud de NP del problema y se propone una heurística que calcula los conjuntos. Estos algoritmos son soluciones centralizadas del problema de agrupación de sensores. Sin embargo, la información global (por ejemplo, la ubicación de cada nodo del sensor en la red) de un WSN a gran escala también es muy costosa de obtener en línea. Además, generalmente es inviable obtener dicha información antes de que se implementen los nodos del sensor. Por ejemplo, los nodos sensores generalmente se implementan de manera aleatoria y la ubicación de cada nodo del sensor en la red se determina solo después de implementar un nodo. La solución del problema de agrupación de sensores solo debe basarse en la información obtenible localmente de un nodo del sensor. Es decir, los nodos deben determinar qué grupo deben unirse de manera completamente distribuida. Aquí la información obtenible localmente se refiere a una información local de nodos y la información que se puede obtener directamente de sus nodos adyacentes, es decir, nodos dentro de su rango de comunicación. En la subsección 3.1, proporcionamos una formulación general del problema del problema de cultivo de sensores. El requisito de solución distribuida se formula en este problema. Le sigue la discusión en la subsección 3.2 sobre un modelo de detección general, que sirve como una condición dada de la formulación del problema de cultivo de sensores. Para facilitar nuestras discusiones, las anotaciones en nuestras siguientes discusiones se describen de la siguiente manera.• N: el número de nodos del sensor en la red.• S (J) (J = 1, 2, ..., M): el conjunto JTH de nodos sensores donde M es el número de conjuntos.• L (i) (i = 1, 2, ..., n): la ubicación física del nodo i.• φ: el área monitoreada por la red: es decir, el área de detección de la red.• R: El radio de detección de un nodo sensor. Suponemos que un nodo del sensor solo puede ser responsable de monitorear un área circular centrada en el nodo con un radio igual a R. Esta es una suposición habitual en el trabajo que aborda los problemas relacionados con la cobertura del sensor. Llamamos a esta área circular el área de detección de un nodo.3.1 Formulación de problemas Suponemos que cada nodo del sensor puede conocer su ubicación física aproximada. La información de ubicación aproximada se puede obtener si cada nodo del sensor lleva un receptor GPS o si se emplean algunos algoritmos de localización (por ejemplo, [3]).2 Tenga en cuenta que si algunos nodos mueren, también se puede realizar un proceso de reemplazo para explotar los nodos restantes en un conjunto de nodos de sensor. Cómo proporcionar este mecanismo está más allá del alcance de este documento y aún por explorar. Problema 1. Dado: • El conjunto de cada nodo sensor está sintiendo vecinos n (i) y la ubicación de cada miembro en n (i);• Un modelo de detección que describe cuantitativamente cómo un punto P en el área φ está cubierto por nodos sensores que son responsables de monitorear este punto. Llamamos a esta cantidad la calidad de cobertura de P. • El requisito de calidad de cobertura en φ, denotado por s.Cuando la cobertura de un punto es mayor que este umbral, decimos que este punto está cubierto. Para cada nodo del sensor I, tome una decisión sobre qué grupo s (j) debe unirse para que: • el área φ pueda estar cubierta por nodos del sensor en cada conjunto s (j) • m, el número de conjuntos s (j) esmaximizado. En esta formulación, llamamos nodos de sensor dentro de un área circular centrada en un nodo del sensor I con un radio igual a 2 · r los vecinos de detección del nodo i. Esto se debe a que los nodos de sensores en esta área, junto con el nodo I, pueden ser cooperativos para garantizar que la cobertura de un punto dentro del nodo sea el área de detección. Suponemos que el rango de comunicación de un nodo del sensor es mayor que 2 · R, que también es una suposición general en el trabajo que aborda los problemas relacionados con la cobertura del sensor. Es decir, la primera condición dada en el Problema 1 es la información que se puede obtener directamente de un nodos adyacentes. Por lo tanto, se puede obtener información local. Las dos últimas condiciones dadas en esta formulación de problemas se pueden programar en un nodo antes de implementarlo o mediante un protocolo de programación de nodo (por ejemplo, [9]) durante el tiempo de ejecución de la red. Por lo tanto, las condiciones dadas pueden obtenerse fácilmente mediante un esquema de cultivo de sensores con implementación completamente distribuida. Reactamos este problema con un modelo de detección realista en la próxima subsección.3.2 Un modelo de detección general como WSN generalmente se emplean para monitorear los posibles eventos en un área determinada, por lo tanto, es un requisito de diseño que los sensores deben detectar con éxito un evento que ocurra en el área de la red. Este problema generalmente se formula como para garantizar que una señal de evento omitida en un punto arbitrario en el área de la red pueda ser detectado por nodos sensores. Obviamente, se requiere un modelo de detección para abordar este problema de modo que se cubra y cuantificar un punto en el área de la red se pueda modelar y cuantificar. Por lo tanto, se puede evaluar la calidad de cobertura de un WSN. Diferentes aplicaciones de WSN emplean diferentes tipos de sensores, que seguramente tienen características teóricas y físicas muy diferentes. Por lo tanto, para cumplir con diferentes requisitos de aplicación, se deben construir diferentes modelos de detección en función de las características de los sensores empleados. Un modelo de detección teórica simple es el modelo de detección booleana [15] [18] [17] [14]. El modelo de detección booleana supone que un nodo del sensor siempre puede detectar un evento que ocurre en su área de detección responsable. Pero la mayoría de los sensores detectan eventos de acuerdo con la intensidad de la señal detectada. Las señales de eventos generalmente se desvanecen en relación con la distancia física entre un evento y el sensor. Cuanto mayor sea la distancia, más débil es el evento que puede ser detectado por el sensor, lo que resulta en una reducción de la probabilidad de que el evento pueda detectar con éxito el evento. Como en WSNS, las señales de eventos suelen ser electromagnéticas, acústicas o señales fotográficas, se desvanecen exponencialmente con el aumento de 1173 su distancia de transmisión. Específicamente, la intensidad de la señal E (d) de un evento que es recibido por un nodo del sensor satisface: E (D) = α Dβ (3) donde D es la distancia física del evento al nodo del sensor;α está relacionado con la intensidad de la señal omitida por el evento;y β es el factor de desvanecimiento de la señal, que típicamente es un número positivo mayor o igual a 2. Por lo general, α y β se consideran constantes. Con base en esta noción, para ser más razonables, los investigadores proponen el modelo de detección de colaboración para capturar los requisitos de aplicación: la cobertura del área puede mantenerse mediante un conjunto de nodos de sensores de colaboración: para un punto con la ubicación física L, el punto se considera cubierto por la colaboración de la colaboración deI sensores (denotado por K1, ..., Ki) si y solo si las siguientes dos ecuaciones son [7] [10] [12].∀j = 1, ..., i;L (kJ) - l <R. (4) C (l) = ix j = 1 (e (l (kJ) - l)> s. (5) C (l) se considera la calidad de cobertura de la ubicación len el área de red [7] [10] [12]. Sin embargo, notamos que definir la sensibilidad como la suma de la intensidad de la señal detectada por cada sensor de colaboración implica una aplicación muy especial: las aplicaciones deben emplear la suma de la resistencia de la señal para lograr la toma de decisiones. Para capturar el requisito de aplicación generalmente realista, modificamos la definición descrita en la ecuación (5). El modelo que adoptamos en este documento se describe en detalle de la siguiente manera. Consideramos la probabilidad P (L, KJ) de que un evento ubicado en L puede ser detectado por Sensor KJ está relacionado con la intensidad de la señal detectada por KJ. Formalmente, p (l, kj) = γe (d) = δ (l (kj) - l / + 1) β, (6) donde γ es constante y δ = γα también es una constante.Normaliza la distancia a una escala adecuada y el elemento +1 es evitar el valor infinito de P (L, KJ). La probabilidad de que un evento ubicado en L pueda ser detectado por cualquier sensor de colaboración que satisfaga la ecuación (4) es: P (L) = 1 - iy J = 1 (1 - P (L, KJ)).(7) Como la probabilidad de detección P (L) determina razonablemente cómo se puede detectar un evento en la ubicación L, es una buena medida de la calidad de cobertura de la ubicación L en un WSN. Específicamente, la ecuación (5) se modifica a: c (l) = p (l) = 1 - iy j = 1 [1 - δ (l (kJ) - l / + 1) β]> s.(8) Para resumirlo, consideramos que un punto en la ubicación L está cubierto si la ecuación (4) y (8) mantiene.4. Algoritmo de deducción de nodo de maximización para el problema de agrupación de sensores Antes de procesar para introducir algoritmos para resolver el problema de agrupación de sensores, definamos el margen (denotado por θ) de un área φ monitoreado por la red como el área marginal similar a la bandade φ y todos los puntos en el perímetro externo de θ están la distancia de ρ de todos los puntos en el perímetro interno de θ.ρ se llama longitud del margen. En una red práctica, los nodos sensores generalmente se implementan uniformemente en el área de la red. Obviamente, el número de nodos sensores que pueden sentir un evento que ocurre en el margen de la red es menor que el número de nodos sensores que pueden sentir un evento que ocurre en otra área de la red. Según esta consideración, en nuestro diseño de algoritmo, nos aseguramos de la calidad de cobertura del área de la red, excepto el margen. La información sobre φ y ρ se basa en la red. Cada nodo del sensor en la red puede ser preprogramado o informado en línea sobre φ y ρ, y así calcular si un punto en su área de detección está en el margen o no.4.1 Algoritmo de deducción de nodo maximizante El proceso de deducción de nodos de nuestro algoritmo de deducción de nodo maximizante-ι es simple. Un nodo I maximiza con avidez ι del sub-red compuesto por sí mismo, sus vecinos de sensación desagradables y los vecinos que están en el mismo grupo de sí mismo. Bajo la restricción de que se debe garantizar la calidad de cobertura de su área de detección, el nodo I elimina los nodos en este sub-red uno por uno. El candidato a podar satisface que: • Es un nodo desagradable.• La eliminación del nodo no dará como resultado puntos descubiertos dentro del área de detección de i. Se elimina un candidato si la eliminación del candidato da como resultado un mayor de la sub-red en comparación con la eliminación de otros candidatos. Este proceso de deducción de nodo continúa hasta que no se puede encontrar ningún candidato. Entonces todos los vecinos de detección desagradables que no se eliminan se agrupan en el mismo grupo de nodo I. Llamamos a los vecinos de detección que están en el mismo grupo de nodo I, el grupo detecta a los vecinos del nodo i. Luego llamamos al nodo I un nodo terminado, lo que significa que ha terminado el procedimiento anterior y el área de detección del nodo está cubierta. Esos nodos que aún no han terminado este procedimiento se llaman nodos inacabados. El procedimiento anterior se inicia en un nodo seleccionado aleatorio que no está en el margen. El nodo se agrupa al primer grupo. Calcula los vecinos de detección del grupo resultante en función del procedimiento anterior. Informa a estos vecinos de detección de grupos que son seleccionados en el grupo. Luego entrega el procedimiento anterior a un grupo inacabado detectando a los vecinos que es el más alejado de sí mismo. Este vecino de detección grupal continúa este procedimiento hasta que no se puede encontrar ningún vecino inacabado. Luego se forma el primer grupo (la descripción algorítmica de este procedimiento se puede encontrar en [19]). Después de que se forma un grupo, otro nodo no agrupado seleccionado aleatorio comienza a agruparse al segundo grupo e inicia el procedimiento anterior. De esta manera, los grupos se forman uno por uno. Cuando un nodo que involucra en este algoritmo descubrió que la calidad de la cobertura si su área de detección, excepto lo que se superpone al margen de la red, no puede garantizarse incluso si todos sus vecinos de detección no agrupados se agrupan en el mismo grupo que mismo, el algoritmo se detiene. La mente se basa en la información obtenible localmente de los nodos sensores. Es un algoritmo distribuido que sirve como una solución aproximada del problema 1. 4.2 Algoritmo de calidad de cobertura incremental: un punto de referencia para la mente para evaluar la efectividad de la introducción de ι en el problema del grupo sensorEl algoritmo (ICQA) está diseñado. Nuestro objetivo 1174 es evaluar cómo funciona una idea, es decir, la mente, basada en la máxima maximizar ι. En ICQA, un proceso de selección de nodo es el siguiente. Un nodo que selecciona con avidez a un vecino de detección desacoplado en el mismo grupo que uno por uno, e informa al vecino que se selecciona en el grupo. El criterio es: • El vecino seleccionado es responsable de proporcionar trabajo de vigilancia para algunas partes descubiertas del nodo es el área de detección.(es decir, el requisito de calidad de cobertura de las piezas no se cumple si no se selecciona este vecino). • El vecino seleccionado da como resultado una mayor mejora de la calidad de cobertura del área de detección de los vecinos. La mejora de la calidad de la cobertura, matemáticamente, debería ser la integral de las mejoras de todos los puntos dentro del área de detección de los vecinos. Se emplea una aproximación numérica para calcular esta mejora. Los detalles se presentan en nuestro estudio de simulación. Este proceso de selección de nodos continúa hasta que el área de detección del nodo I está completamente cubierta. De esta manera, se encuentran vecinos de detección de grupo. El procedimiento anterior se entrega como lo que hace la mente y los nuevos grupos se forman uno por uno. Y la condición que se detiene ICQA es la misma que la mente. ICQA también se basa en información obtenible localmente de nodos sensores. ICQA también es un algoritmo distribuido que sirve como una solución aproximada del problema 1. 5. Resultados de la simulación Para evaluar la efectividad del empleo de ι en el problema de grupos de sensores, creamos redes de vigilancia de simulación. Empleamos Mind e ICQA para agrupar los nodos del sensor en la red. Comparamos los resultados de agrupación con respecto a cuántos grupos encuentran ambos algoritmos y cómo son el rendimiento de los grupos resultantes. La configuración detallada de las redes de simulación se muestra en la Tabla 1. En las redes de simulación, los nodos sensores se implementan aleatoriamente de manera uniforme en el área de red. Tabla 1: La configuración del área de redes de simulación del campo del sensor 400m*400m ρ 20M R 80M α, β, γ y 1.0, 2.0, 1.0 y 100.0 s 0.6 para evaluar la calidad de cobertura del área de detección de un nodo, nos dividimosEl área de detección de un nodo en varias regiones y considera la calidad de cobertura del punto central en cada región como un representante de la calidad de cobertura de la región. Esta es una aproximación numérica. Un mayor número de tales regiones da como resultado una mejor aproximación. Como los nodos sensores son con baja capacidad computacional, existe una compensación entre el número de dichas regiones y la precisión de la calidad de cobertura resultante del área de detección de un nodo. En nuestro estudio de simulación, establecemos este número 12. Para evaluar la mejora de la calidad de la cobertura en ICQA, resumimos todas las mejoras en cada centro de región como la mejora total.5.1 Número de grupos formados por Mind e ICQA Establecemos el número de nodo total en la red en diferentes valores y permitimos que las redes funcionen Mind e ICQA. Para cada N, las simulaciones se ejecutan con varias semillas aleatorias para generar diferentes redes. Los resultados se promedian. La Figura 2 muestra los números de grupo que se encuentran en las redes con diferentes NS.500 1000 1500 2000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Número de nodo total en la red TotalNumberOfGroupSfound ICQA MMNP Figura 2: El número de grupos encontrados por Mind e ICQA podemos ver que la mente siempre supera a ICQA en términos de número de número de número degrupos formados. Obviamente, cuanto mayor se puede formar el número de grupos, más se explota la redundancia de cada grupo. Esta salida muestra que un enfoque como la mente que tiene como objetivo maximizar ι de la topología resultante puede explotar bien la redundancia. Como ejemplo, en el caso de que n = 1500, los resultados de cinco redes se enumeran en la Tabla 2. Table 2: The grouping results of five networks with n = 1500 Net MIND ICQA MIND ICQA Group Number Group Number Average ι Average ι 1 34 31 0.145514 0.031702 2 33 30 0.145036 0.036649 3 33 31 0.156483 0.033578 4 32 31 0.152671 0.029030 5 33 32 0.1465600.033109 La diferencia entre el promedio ι de los grupos en cada red muestra que los grupos formados por la mente dan como resultado topologías con ι más grandes. Demuestra que ι es un buen indicador de redundancia en diferentes redes.5.2 El rendimiento de los grupos resultantes Aunque la mente forma más grupos que ICQA, lo que implica una vida útil más larga de las redes, otra consideración de importancia es cómo funcionan estos grupos formados por Mind e ICQA. Dejamos que 10000 eventos ocurran aleatoriamente en el área de la red, excepto en el margen. Comparamos cuántos eventos ocurren en los lugares donde la calidad es menor que el requisito S = 0.6 cuando cada grupo resultante está realizando trabajo de vigilancia (llamamos el número de tales eventos el número de falla del grupo). La Figura 3 muestra los números de falla promedio de los grupos resultantes cuando se establecen diferentes números de nodos. Podemos ver que los grupos formados por la mente superan a los formados por ICQA porque los grupos formados por la mente dan como resultado números de falla más bajos. Esto demuestra además que la mente es un buen enfoque para el problema de grupos de sensores.1175 500 1000 1500 2000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Número de nodo total en el NEDE NÚMERO promedio de los números de medidas de información ICQA MMNP Figura 3: Los números de falla de la mente e ICQA 6. Conclusión Este documento propone ι, un nuevo índice para la evaluación de la distribución de puntos.ι es la distancia mínima entre cada par de puntos normalizados por la distancia promedio entre cada par de puntos. Encontramos que un conjunto de puntos que logran un valor máximo de ι dan como resultado una estructura de panal. Proponemos que puede servir como un buen índice para evaluar la distribución de los puntos, que pueden emplearse en problemas relacionados con la cobertura en redes de sensores inalámbricos (WSN). Nos propusimos validar esta idea empleando ι a un problema de agrupación de sensores. Formulamos un problema general de grupos de sensores para WSN y proporcionamos un modelo de detección general. Con un algoritmo llamado Deducción de nodo Maximizing-ι, mostramos que maximizar ι en los nodos sensores es un buen enfoque para resolver este problema. Los resultados de la simulación verifican que la mente supera un algoritmo codicioso que explota la redundancia del sensor que diseñamos en términos del número y el rendimiento de los grupos formados. Esto demuestra una buena aplicación del empleo de ι en problemas relacionados con la cobertura.7.

        "A WSN can collect the data about physical phenomena of interest [1].",
        "There are many potential applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring and surveillance, etc. [1][11].",
        "In many application scenarios, WSNs are employed to conduct surveillance tasks in adverse, or even worse, in hostile working environments.",
        "One major problem caused is that sensor nodes are subjected to failures.",
        "Therefore, fault tolerance of a WSN is critical.",
        "One way to achieve fault tolerance is that a WSN should contain a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures.",
        "It is vital to provide a mechanism that redundant nodes can be working in sleeping mode (i.e., major power-consuming units such as the transceiver of a redundant sensor node can be shut off) to save energy, and thus to prolong the network lifetime.",
        "Redundancy should be exploited as much as possible for the set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area [6].",
        "We find that the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points serves as a good index to evaluate the distribution of the points.",
        "We call this index, denoted by ι, the normalized minimum distance.",
        "If points are moveable, we find that maximizing ι results in a honeycomb structure.",
        "The honeycomb structure poses that the coverage efficiency is the best if each point represents a sensor node that is providing surveillance work.",
        "Employing ι in coverage-related problems is thus deemed promising.",
        "This enlightens us that maximizing ι is a good approach to select a set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.",
        "To explore the effectiveness of employing ι in coverage-related problems, we formulate a sensorgrouping problem for high-redundancy WSNs.",
        "An algorithm called Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction (MIND) is proposed in which redundant sensor nodes are removed to obtain a large ι for each set of sensors that are currently taking charge in the surveillance work of the network area.",
        "We also introduce another greedy solution called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) for this problem, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate MIND.",

        "First, we introduce a novel index ι for evaluation of point-distribution.",
        "We show that maximizing ι of a WSN results in low redundancy of the network.",
        "Second, we formulate a general sensor-grouping problem for WSNs and provide a general sensing model.",

        "The coordinates of these points are denoted by xi (i = 1, ..., n).",
        "It may be necessary to evaluate how the distribution of these points is.",
        "There are many metrics to achieve this goal.",
        "For example, the Mean Square Error from these points to their mean value can be employed to calculate how these points deviate from their mean (i.e., their central).",
        "In resource-sharing evaluation, the Global Fairness Index (GFI) is often employed to measure how even the resource distributes among these points [8], when xi represents the amount of resource that belong to point i.",
        "In WSNs, GFI is usually used to calculate how even the remaining energy of sensor nodes is.",
        "When n is larger than 2 and the points do not all overlap (That points all overlap means xi = xj, ∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n).",
        "We propose a novel index called the normalized minimum distance, namely ι, to evaluate the distribution of the points. ι is the minimum distance between each pair of points normalized by the average distance between each pair of points.",
        "It is calculated by: ι = min(||xi − xj||) µ (∀ i, j = 1, 2, ..., n; and i = j) (1) where ||xi − xj|| denotes the Euclidean distance between point i and point j in Ω, the min(·) function calculates the minimum distance between each pair of points, and µ is the average distance between each pair of points, which is: µ = ( Pn i=1 Pn j=1,j=i ||xi − xj||) n(n − 1) (2) ι measures how well the points separate from one another.",
        "Obviously, ι is in interval [0, 1]. ι is equal to 1 if and only if n is equal to 3 and these three points forms an equilateral triangle. ι is equal to zero if any two points overlap. ι is a very interesting value of a set of points.",
        "If we consider each xi (∀i = 1, ..., n) is a variable in Ω, how these n points would look like if ι is maximized?",
        "An algorithm is implemented to generate the topology in which ι is locally maximized (The algorithm can be found in [19]).",
        "We consider a 2-dimensional space.",
        "We select n = 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 and perform this algorithm.",
        "In order to avoid that the algorithm converge to local optimum, we select different random seeds to generate the initial points for 1000 time and obtain the best one that results in the largest ι when the algorithm converges.",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates what the resulting topology looks like when n = 20 as an example.",
        "Suppose each point represents a sensor node.",
        "If the sensor coverage model is the Boolean coverage model [15][17][18][14] and the coverage radius of each node is the same.",
        "It is exciting to see that this topology results in lowest redundancy because the Vonoroi diagram [2] formed by these nodes (A Vonoroi diagram formed by a set of nodes partitions a space into a set of convex polygons such that points inside a polygon are closest to only one particular node) is a honeycomb-like structure1 .",
        "This enlightens us that ι may be employed to solve problems related to sensor-coverage of an area.",

        "Under the constraint that the sensing area should be covered, the more each node separates from the others, the less the redundancy of the coverage is. ι indicates the quality of such separation.",
        "It should be useful for approaches on sensor-coverage related problems.",
        "In our following discussions, we will show the effectiveness of employing ι in sensor-grouping problem. 3.",
        "THE SENSOR-GROUPING PROBLEM In many application scenarios, to achieve fault tolerance, a WSN contains a large number of redundant nodes in order to tolerate node failures.",
        "A node sleeping-working schedule scheme is therefore highly desired to exploit the redundancy of working sensors and let as many nodes as possible sleep.",
        "Much work in the literature is on this issue [6].",
        "Yan et al introduced a differentiated service in which a sensor node finds out its responsible working duration with cooperation of its neighbors to ensure the coverage of sampled points [17].",
        "Ye et al developed PEAS in which sensor nodes wake up randomly over time, probe their neighboring nodes, and decide whether they should begin to take charge of surveillance work [18].",
        "Xing et al exploited a probabilistic distributed detection model with a protocol called Coordinating Grid (Co-Grid) [16].",
        "Wang et al designed an approach called Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) which introduced the notion that the coverage degree of intersection-points of the neighboring nodes sensing-perimeters indicates the coverage of a convex region [15].",
        "In our recent work [7], we also provided a sleeping configuration protocol, namely SSCP, in which sleeping eligibility of a sensor node is determined by a local Voronoi diagram.",
        "SSCP can provide different levels of redundancy to maintain different requirements of fault tolerance.",
        "The major feature of the aforementioned protocols is that they employ online distributed and localized algorithms in which a sensor node determines its sleeping eligibility and/or sleeping time based on the coverage requirement of its sensing area with some information provided by its neighbors.",
        "Another major approach for sensor node sleeping-working scheduling issue is to group sensor nodes.",
        "Sensor nodes in a network are divided into several disjoint sets.",
        "Each set of sensor nodes are able to maintain the required area surveillance work.",
        "The sensor nodes are scheduled according to which set they belong to.",
        "These sets work successively.",
        "Only one set of sensor nodes work at any time.",
        "We call the issue sensor-grouping problem.",
        "The major advantage of this approach is that it avoids the overhead caused by the processes of coordination of sensor nodes to make decision on whether a sensor node is a candidate to sleep or 1172 work and how long it should sleep or work.",
        "Such processes should be performed from time to time during the lifetime of a network in many online distributed and localized algorithms.",
        "The large overhead caused by such processes is the main drawback of the online distributed and localized algorithms.",
        "On the contrary, roughly speaking, this approach groups sensor nodes in one time and schedules when each set of sensor nodes should be on duty.",
        "It does not require frequent decision-making on working/sleeping eligibility2 .",
        "In [13] by Slijepcevic et al, the sensing area is divided into regions.",
        "Sensor nodes are grouped with the most-constrained leastconstraining algorithm.",
        "It is a greedy algorithm in which the priority of selecting a given sensor is determined by how many uncovered regions this sensor covers and the redundancy caused by this sensor.",
        "In [5] by Cardei et al, disjoint sensor sets are modeled as disjoint dominating sets.",
        "Although maximum dominating sets computation is NP-complete, the authors proposed a graphcoloring based algorithm.",
        "Cardei et al also studied similar problem in the domain of covering target points in [4].",
        "The NP-completeness of the problem is proved and a heuristic that computes the sets are proposed.",
        "These algorithms are centralized solutions of sensorgrouping problem.",
        "However, global information (e.g., the location of each in-network sensor node) of a large scale WSN is also very expensive to obtained online.",
        "Also it is usually infeasible to obtain such information before sensor nodes are deployed.",
        "For example, sensor nodes are usually deployed in a random manner and the location of each in-network sensor node is determined only after a node is deployed.",
        "The solution of sensor-grouping problem should only base on locally obtainable information of a sensor node.",
        "That is to say, nodes should determine which group they should join in a fully distributed way.",
        "Here locally obtainable information refers to a nodes local information and the information that can be directly obtained from its adjacent nodes, i.e., nodes within its communication range.",
        "In Subsection 3.1, we provide a general problem formulation of the sensor-grouping problem.",
        "Distributed-solution requirement is formulated in this problem.",
        "It is followed by discussion in Subsection 3.2 on a general sensing model, which serves as a given condition of the sensor-grouping problem formulation.",
        "To facilitate our discussions, the notations in our following discussions are described as follows. • n: The number in-network sensor nodes. • S(j) (j = 1, 2, ..., m): The jth set of sensor nodes where m is the number of sets. • L(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., n): The physical location of node i. • φ: The area monitored by the network: i.e., the sensing area of the network. • R: The sensing radius of a sensor node.",
        "We assume that a sensor node can only be responsible to monitor a circular area centered at the node with a radius equal to R. This is a usual assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.",
        "We call this circular area the sensing area of a node. 3.1 Problem Formulation We assume that each sensor node can know its approximate physical location.",
        "The approximate location information is obtainable if each sensor node carries a GPS receiver or if some localization algorithms are employed (e.g., [3]). 2 Note that if some nodes die, a re-grouping process might also be performed to exploit the remaining nodes in a set of sensor nodes.",
        "How to provide this mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper and yet to be explored.",
        "Problem 1.",
        "Given: • The set of each sensor node is sensing neighbors N(i) and the location of each member in N(i); • A sensing model which quantitatively describes how a point P in area φ is covered by sensor nodes that are responsible to monitor this point.",
        "We call this quantity the coverage quality of P. • The coverage quality requirement in φ, denoted by s. When the coverage of a point is larger than this threshold, we say this point is covered.",
        "For each sensor node i, make a decision on which group S(j) it should join so that: • Area φ can be covered by sensor nodes in each set S(j) • m, the number of sets S(j) is maximized.",
        "In this formulation, we call sensor nodes within a circular area centered at a sensor node i with a radius equal to 2 · R the sensing neighbors of node i.",
        "This is because sensors nodes in this area, together with node i, may be cooperative to ensure the coverage of a point inside node is sensing area.",
        "We assume that the communication range of a sensor node is larger than 2 · R, which is also a general assumption in work that addresses sensor-coverage related problems.",
        "That is to say, the first given condition in Problem 1 is the information that can be obtained directly from a nodes adjacent nodes.",
        "It is therefore locally obtainable information.",
        "The last two given conditions in this problem formulation can be programmed into a node before it is deployed or by a node-programming protocol (e.g., [9]) during network runtime.",
        "Therefore, the given conditions can all be easily obtained by a sensor-grouping scheme with fully distributed implementation.",
        "We reify this problem with a realistic sensing model in next subsection. 3.2 A General Sensing Model As WSNs are usually employed to monitor possible events in a given area, it is therefore a design requirement that an event occurring in the network area must/may be successfully detected by sensors.",
        "This issue is usually formulated as how to ensure that an event signal omitted in an arbitrary point in the network area can be detected by sensor nodes.",
        "Obviously, a sensing model is required to address this problem so that how a point in the network area is covered can be modeled and quantified.",
        "Thus the coverage quality of a WSN can be evaluated.",
        "Different applications of WSNs employ different types of sensors, which surely have widely different theoretical and physical characteristics.",
        "Therefore, to fulfill different application requirements, different sensing models should be constructed based on the characteristics of the sensors employed.",
        "A simple theoretical sensing model is the Boolean sensing model [15][18][17][14].",
        "Boolean sensing model assumes that a sensor node can always detect an event occurring in its responsible sensing area.",
        "But most sensors detect events according to the signal strength sensed.",
        "Event signals usually fade in relation to the physical distance between an event and the sensor.",
        "The larger the distance, the weaker the event signals that can be sensed by the sensor, which results in a reduction of the probability that the event can be successfully detected by the sensor.",
        "As in WSNs, event signals are usually electromagnetic, acoustic, or photic signals, they fade exponentially with the increasing of 1173 their transmit distance.",
        "Specifically, the signal strength E(d) of an event that is received by a sensor node satisfies: E(d) = α dβ (3) where d is the physical distance from the event to the sensor node; α is related to the signal strength omitted by the event; and β is signal fading factor which is typically a positive number larger than or equal to 2.",
        "Usually, α and β are considered as constants.",
        "Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12]. ∀j = 1, ..., i; L(kj) − L < R. (4) C(L) = iX j=1 (E( L(kj) − L ) > s. (5) C(L) is regarded as the coverage quality of location L in the network area [7][10][12].",
        "However, we notice that defining the sensibility as the sum of the sensed signal strength by each collaborative sensor implies a very special application: Applications must employ the sum of the signal strength to achieve decision-making.",
        "To capture generally realistic application requirement, we modify the definition described in Equation (5).",
        "The model we adopt in this paper is described in details as follows.",
        "We consider the probability P(L, kj ) that an event located at L can be detected by sensor kj is related to the signal strength sensed by kj.",
        "Formally, P(L, kj) = γE(d) = δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β , (6) where γ is a constant and δ = γα is a constant too. normalizes the distance to a proper scale and the +1 item is to avoid infinite value of P(L, kj).",
        "The probability that an event located at L can be detected by any collaborative sensors that satisfied Equation (4) is: P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 (1 − P(L, kj )). (7) As the detection probability P (L) reasonably determines how an event occurring at location L can be detected by the networks, it is a good measure of the coverage quality of location L in a WSN.",
        "Specifically, Equation (5) is modified to: C(L) = P (L) = 1 − iY j=1 [1 − δ ( L(kj) − L / + 1)β ] > s. (8) To sum it up, we consider a point at location L is covered if Equation (4) and (8) hold. 4.",
        "MAXIMIZING-ι NODE-DEDUCTION ALGORITHM FOR SENSOR-GROUPING PROBLEM Before we process to introduce algorithms to solve the sensor grouping problem, let us define the margin (denoted by θ) of an area φ monitored by the network as the band-like marginal area of φ and all the points on the outer perimeter of θ is ρ distance away from all the points on the inner perimeter of θ. ρ is called the margin length.",
        "In a practical network, sensor nodes are usually evenly deployed in the network area.",
        "Obviously, the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring in the margin of the network is smaller than the number of sensor nodes that can sense an event occurring in other area of the network.",
        "Based on this consideration, in our algorithm design, we ensure the coverage quality of the network area except the margin.",
        "The information on φ and ρ is networkbased.",
        "Each in-network sensor node can be pre-programmed or on-line informed about φ and ρ, and thus calculate whether a point in its sensing area is in the margin or not. 4.1 Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction Algorithm The node-deduction process of our Maximizing-ι Node-Deduction Algorithm (MIND) is simple.",
        "A node i greedily maximizes ι of the sub-network composed by itself, its ungrouped sensing neighbors, and the neighbors that are in the same group of itself.",
        "Under the constraint that the coverage quality of its sensing area should be ensured, node i deletes nodes in this sub-network one by one.",
        "The candidate to be pruned satisfies that: • It is an ungrouped node. • The deletion of the node will not result in uncovered-points inside the sensing area of i.",
        "A candidate is deleted if the deletion of the candidate results in largest ι of the sub-network compared to the deletion of other candidates.",
        "This node-deduction process continues until no candidate can be found.",
        "Then all the ungrouped sensing neighbors that are not deleted are grouped into the same group of node i.",
        "We call the sensing neighbors that are in the same group of node i the group sensing neighbors of node i.",
        "We then call node i a finished node, meaning that it has finished the above procedure and the sensing area of the node is covered.",
        "Those nodes that have not yet finished this procedure are called unfinished nodes.",
        "The above procedure initiates at a random-selected node that is not in the margin.",
        "The node is grouped to the first group.",
        "It calculates the resulting group sensing neighbors of it based on the above procedure.",
        "It informs these group sensing neighbors that they are selected in the group.",
        "Then it hands over the above procedure to an unfinished group sensing neighbors that is the farthest from itself.",
        "This group sensing neighbor continues this procedure until no unfinished neighbor can be found.",
        "Then the first group is formed (Algorithmic description of this procedure can be found at [19]).",
        "After a group is formed, another random-selected ungrouped node begins to group itself to the second group and initiates the above procedure.",
        "In this way, groups are formed one by one.",
        "When a node that involves in this algorithm found out that the coverage quality if its sensing area, except what overlaps the network margin, cannot be ensured even if all its ungrouped sensing neighbors are grouped into the same group as itself, the algorithm stops.",
        "MIND is based on locally obtainable information of sensor nodes.",
        "It is a distributed algorithm that serves as an approximate solution of Problem 1. 4.2 Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm: A Benchmark for MIND To evaluate the effectiveness of introducing ι in the sensor-group problem, another algorithm for sensor-group problem called Incremental Coverage Quality Algorithm (ICQA) is designed.",
        "Our aim 1174 is to evaluate how an idea, i.e., MIND, based on locally maximize ι performs.",
        "In ICQA, a node-selecting process is as follows.",
        "A node i greedily selects an ungrouped sensing neighbor in the same group as itself one by one, and informs the neighbor it is selected in the group.",

                "Boolean sensing model assumes that a sensor node can always detect an event occurring in its responsible sensing area.",

                "The larger the distance, the weaker the event signals that can be sensed by the sensor, which results in a reduction of the probability that the event can be successfully detected by the sensor.",
                "As in WSNs, event signals are usually electromagnetic, acoustic, or photic signals, they fade exponentially with the increasing of 1173 their transmit distance.",
                "Specifically, the signal strength E(d) of an event that is received by a sensor node satisfies: E(d) = α dβ (3) where d is the physical distance from the event to the sensor node; α is related to the signal strength omitted by the event; and β is signal fading factor which is typically a positive number larger than or equal to 2.",
                "Usually, α and β are considered as constants.",
                "Based on this notion, to be more reasonable, researchers propose collaborative sensing model to capture application requirements: Area coverage can be maintained by a set of collaborative sensor nodes: For a point with physical location L, the point is considered covered by the collaboration of i sensors (denoted by k1, ..., ki) if and only if the following two equations holds [7][10][12]. ∀j = 1, ..., i; L(kj) − L < R. (4) C(L) = iX j=1 (E( L(kj) − L ) > s. (5) C(L) is regarded as the coverage quality of location L in the network area [7][10][12].",
