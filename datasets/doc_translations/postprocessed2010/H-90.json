In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting. We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents. We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set. Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1. INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents. From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need. An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available. Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2]. There are many kinds of context that we can exploit. Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy. However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents. Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information. Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications. For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8]. For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied. In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading). We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results. A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort. For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia. As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island. However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents. Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information. For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for. Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works. In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people. In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated. In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user. Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6]. While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval. Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy. We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information. We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model. One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation. We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback. We evaluate the proposed models using this data set. The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user. The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later. In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models. In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments. In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set. Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback. One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session. A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need. The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context. Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search. In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session. The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time. Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session. In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context. In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times. During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query. Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session. Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper. In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16]. Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval. But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section. Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy. In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available. For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view. We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history. The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document. Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need. Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval. In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1. We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk. Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17]. Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them. In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3. LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk. An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively. We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method. According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document. One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model. Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk. Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history. Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally. Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC . We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k). We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text. We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ). Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H). Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk). These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information. If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries. But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history. To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator. The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ). We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length. Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±. Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries. This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries. However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better. Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable. Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries. Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way. In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents. In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need. In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query. A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general. Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary). To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior. We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions. With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation. In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment. As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model. Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user. For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past. We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0. After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1. The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1. As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1. As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2. In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model. Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci. In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data. Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary. If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci). On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model. Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence. In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i. For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi. But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j. Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents. This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen. To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight. This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document. One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries. The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries. As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value. And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4. DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic. Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one. There are two choices. One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine). But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data. The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file. Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data. We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data. We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments. There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words. Most articles have titles. If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title. For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming. We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150. These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20]. The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user. In real applications, we may also expect our models to be most useful for such difficult topics, so our data collection strategy reflects the real world applications well. We index the TREC AP data set and set up a search engine and web interface for TREC AP news articles. We use 3 subjects to do experiments to collect query history and clickthrough history data. Each subject is assigned 10 topics and given the topic descriptions provided by TREC. For each topic, the first query is the title of the topic given in the original TREC topic description. After the subject submits the query, the search engine will do retrieval and return a ranked list of search results to the subject. The subject will browse the results and maybe click one or more results to browse the full text of article(s). The subject may also modify the query to do another search. For each topic, the subject composes at least 4 queries. In our experiment, only the first 4 queries for each topic are used. The user needs to select the topic number from a selection menu before submitting the query to the search engine so that we can easily detect the session boundary, which is not the focus of our study. We use a relational database to store user interactions, including the submitted queries and clicked documents. For each query, we store the query terms and the associated result pages. And for each clicked document, we store the summary as shown on the search result page. The summary of the article is query dependent and is computed online using fixed-length passage retrieval (KL divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing). Among 120 (4 for each of 30 topics) queries which we study in the experiment, the average query length is 3.71 words. Altogether there are 91 documents clicked to view. So on average, there are around 3 clicks per topic.

EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experiment design Our major hypothesis is that using search context (i.e., query history and clickthrough information) can help improve search accuracy. In particular, the search context can provide extra information to help us estimate a better query model than using just the current query. So most of our experiments involve comparing the retrieval performance using the current query only (thus ignoring any context) with that using the current query as well as the search context. Since we collected four versions of queries for each topic, we make such comparisons for each version of queries. We use two performance measures: (1) Mean Average Precision (MAP): This is the standard non-interpolated average precision and serves as a good measure of the overall ranking accuracy. (2) Precision at 20 documents (pr@20docs): This measure does not average well, but it is more meaningful than MAP and reflects the utility for users who only read the top 20 documents. In all cases, the reported figure is the average over all of the 30 topics. We evaluate the four models for exploiting search context (i.e., FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp, and BatchUp). Each model has precisely two parameters (Î± and Î² for FixInt; Âµ and Î½ for others). Note that Âµ and Î½ may need to be interpreted differently for different methods. We vary these parameters and identify the optimal performance for each method. We also vary the parameters to study the sensitivity of our algorithms to the setting of the parameters. 5.2 Result analysis 5.2.1 Overall effect of search context We compare the optimal performances of four models with those using the current query only in Table 1. A row labeled with qi is the baseline performance and a row labeled with qi + HQ + HC is the performance of using search context. We can make several observations from this table: 1. Comparing the baseline performances indicates that on average reformulated queries are better than the previous queries with the performance of q4 being the best. Users generally formulate better and better queries. 2. Using search context generally has positive effect, especially when the context is rich. This can be seen from the fact that the 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip improvement for q4 and q3 is generally more substantial compared with q2. Actually, in many cases with q2, using the context may hurt the performance, probably because the history at that point is sparse. When the search context is rich, the performance improvement can be quite substantial. For example, BatchUp achieves 92.4% improvement in the mean average precision over q3 and 77.2% improvement over q4. (The generally low precisions also make the relative improvement deceptively high, though.) 3. Among the four models using search context, the performances of FixInt and OnlineUp are clearly worse than those of BayesInt and BatchUp. Since BayesInt performs better than FixInt and the main difference between BayesInt and FixInt is that the former uses an adaptive coefficient for interpolation, the results suggest that using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a Bayesian style interpolation makes sense. The main difference between OnlineUp and BatchUp is that OnlineUp uses decaying coefficients to combine the multiple clicked summaries, while BatchUp simply concatenates all clicked summaries. Therefore the fact that BatchUp is consistently better than OnlineUp indicates that the weights for combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying. While OnlineUp is theoretically appealing, its performance is inferior to BayesInt and BatchUp, likely because of the decaying coefficient. Overall, BatchUp appears to be the best method when we vary the parameter settings. We have two different kinds of search context - query history and clickthrough data. We now look into the contribution of each kind of context. 5.2.2 Using query history only In each of four models, we can turn off the clickthrough history data by setting parameters appropriately. This allows us to evaluate the effect of using query history alone. We use the same parameter setting for query history as in Table 1. The results are shown in Table 2. Here we see that in general, the benefit of using query history is very limited with mixed results. This is different from what is reported in a previous study [15], where using query history is consistently helpful. Another observation is that the context runs perform poorly at q2, but generally perform (slightly) better than the baselines for q3 and q4. This is again likely because at the beginning the initial query, which is the title in the original TREC topic description, may not be a good query; indeed, on average, performances of these first-generation queries are clearly poorer than those of all other user-formulated queries in the later generations. Yet another observation is that when using query history only, the BayesInt model appears to be better than other models. Since the clickthrough data is ignored, OnlineUp and BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (Î± = 0.1, Î² = 0) (Âµ = 0.2,Î½ = 0) (Âµ = 5.0,Î½ = +âˆž) (Âµ = 2.0, Î½ = +âˆž) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Improve. -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Improve -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Improve -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Table 2: Effect of using query history only for document ranking.

The displayed results thus reflect the variation caused by parameter Âµ. A smaller setting of 2.0 is seen better than a larger value of 5.0. A more complete picture of the influence of the setting of Âµ can be seen from Table 3, where we show the performance figures for a wider range of values of Âµ. The value of Âµ can be interpreted as how many words we regard the query history is worth. A larger value thus puts more weight on the history and is seen to hurt the performance more when the history information is not rich. Thus while for q4 the best performance tends to be achieved for Âµ âˆˆ [2, 5], only when Âµ = 0.5 we see some small benefit for q2. As we would expect, an excessively large Âµ would hurt the performance in general, but q2 is hurt most and q4 is barely hurt, indicating that as we accumulate more and more query history information, we can put more and more weight on the history information. This also suggests that a better strategy should probably dynamically adjust parameters according to how much history information we have. The mixed query history results suggest that the positive effect of using implicit feedback information may have largely come from the use of clickthrough history, which is indeed true as we discuss in the next subsection. 5.2.3 Using clickthrough history only We now turn off the query history and only use the clicked summaries plus the current query. The results are shown in Table 4. We see that the benefit of using clickthrough information is much more significant than that of using query history. We see an overall positive effect, often with significant improvement over the baseline. It is also clear that the richer the context data is, the more improvement using clicked summaries can achieve. Other than some occasional degradation of precision at 20 documents, the improvement is fairly consistent and often quite substantial. These results show that the clicked summary text is in general quite useful for inferring a users information need. Intuitively, using the summary text, rather than the actual content of the document, makes more sense, as it is quite possible that the document behind a seemingly relevant summary is actually non-relevant. 29 out of the 91 clicked documents are relevant. Updating the query model based on such summaries would bring up the ranks of these relevant documents, causing performance improvement. However, such improvement is really not beneficial for the user as the user has already seen these relevant documents. To see how much improvement we have achieved on improving the ranks of the unseen relevant documents, we exclude these 29 relevant documents from our judgment file and recompute the performance of BayesInt and the baseline using the new judgment file. The results are shown in Table 5. Note that the performance of the baseline method is lower due to the removal of the 29 relevant documents, which would have been generally ranked high in the results. From Table 5, we see clearly that using clicked summaries also helps improve the ranks of unseen relevant documents significantly.

To answer this question, we took out the 29 relevant summaries from our clickthrough history data HC to obtain a smaller set of clicked summaries HC , and re-evaluated the performance of the BayesInt method using HC with the same setting of parameters as in Table 4. The results are shown in Table 6. We see that although the improvement is not as substantial as in Table 4, the average precision is improved across all generations of queries. These results should be interpreted as very encouraging as they are based on only 62 non-relevant clickthroughs. In reality, a user would more likely click some relevant summaries, which would help bring up more relevant documents as we have seen in Table 4 and Table 5.

In Table 7, we show this effect for the BatchUp method. 5.2.5 Parameter sensitivity All four models have two parameters to control the relative weights of HQ, HC , and Qk, though the parameterization is different from model to model. In this subsection, we study the parameter sensitivity for BatchUp, which appears to perform relatively better than others. BatchUp has two parameters Âµ and Î½. We first look at Âµ. When Âµ is set to 0, the query history is not used at all, and we essentially just use the clickthrough data combined with the current query. If we increase Âµ, we will gradually incorporate more information from the previous queries. In Table 8, we show how the average precision of BatchUp changes as we vary Âµ with Î½ fixed to 15.0, where the best performance of BatchUp is achieved. We see that the performance is mostly insensitive to the change of Âµ for q3 and q4, but is decreasing as Âµ increases for q2. The pattern is also similar when we set Î½ to other values. In addition to the fact that q1 is generally worse than q2, q3, and q4, another possible reason why the sensitivity is lower for q3 and q4 may be that we generally have more clickthrough data available for q3 and q4 than for q2, and the dominating influence of the clickthrough data has made the small differences caused by Âµ less visible for q3 and q4. The best performance is generally achieved when Âµ is around 2.0, which means that the past query information is as useful as about 2 words in the current query. Except for q2, there is clearly some tradeoff between the current query and the previous queries Query MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Improve. -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Improve. 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Improve. 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Improve 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Improve 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Improve 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Improve 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Improve 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Improve 77.2% 16.4% Table 7: Additive benefit of context information and using a balanced combination of them achieves better performance than using each of them alone. We now turn to the other parameter Î½. When Î½ is set to 0, we only use the clickthrough data; When Î½ is set to +âˆž, we only use the query history and the current query. With Âµ set to 2.0, where the best performance of BatchUp is achieved, we vary Î½ and show the results in Table 9. We see that the performance is also not very sensitive when Î½ â‰¤ 30, with the best performance often achieved at Î½ = 15. This means that the combined information of query history and the current query is as useful as about 15 words in the clickthrough data, indicating that the clickthrough information is highly valuable. Overall, these sensitivity results show that BatchUp not only performs better than other methods, but also is quite robust. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have explored how to exploit implicit feedback information, including query history and clickthrough history within the same search session, to improve information retrieval performance. Using the KL-divergence retrieval model as the basis, we proposed and studied four statistical language models for context-sensitive information retrieval, i.e., FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp and BatchUp.

Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially clickthrough history, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring any additional user effort. The current work can be extended in several ways: First, we have only explored some very simple language models for incorporating implicit feedback information. It would be interesting to develop more sophisticated models to better exploit query history and clickthrough history. For example, we may treat a clicked summary differently depending on whether the current query is a generalization or refinement of the previous query. Second, the proposed models can be implemented in any practical systems. We are currently developing a client-side personalized search agent, which will incorporate some of the proposed algorithms. We will also do a user study to evaluate effectiveness of these models in the real web search. Finally, we should further study a general retrieval framework for sequential decision making in interactive information retrieval and study how to optimize some of the parameters in the context-sensitive retrieval models. 7.

En este documento, estudiamos cÃ³mo explotar la informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, incluidas consultas anteriores e informaciÃ³n de clics, para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n en un entorno de recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperaciÃ³n sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadÃ­stico para combinar las consultas anteriores y hacer clic en resÃºmenes de documentos con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificaciÃ³n de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una recopilaciÃ³n de pruebas con informaciÃ³n de contexto de bÃºsqueda y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, especialmente los resÃºmenes de documentos haciendo clic, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n. CategorÃ­as y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [BÃºsqueda y recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n]: Modelos de recuperaciÃ³n TÃ©rminos generales Algoritmos 1. IntroducciÃ³n En la mayorÃ­a de los modelos de recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n existentes, el problema de recuperaciÃ³n se trata como que involucra una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. Sin embargo, de una sola consulta, el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de la informaciÃ³n de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, un sistema de recuperaciÃ³n Ã³ptimo debe tratar de explotar la mayor cantidad de informaciÃ³n de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n, siempre que estÃ© disponible. De hecho, la recuperaciÃ³n sensible al contexto se ha identificado como un desafÃ­o importante en la investigaciÃ³n de recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n [2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos explotar. La retroalimentaciÃ³n de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione mÃ¡s contexto de bÃºsqueda y se sabe que es efectivo para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, la retroalimentaciÃ³n de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explÃ­citamente informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n, como especificar la categorÃ­a de la necesidad de informaciÃ³n o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a involucrar actividades adicionales, mientras que los beneficios no siempre son obvios para el usuario, un usuario a menudo es reacio a proporcionar dicha informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentaciÃ³n de relevancia puede ser limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razÃ³n, la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita ha atraÃ­do mucha atenciÃ³n recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperaciÃ³n utilizando la consulta inicial de los usuarios pueden no ser satisfactorios;A menudo, el usuario necesitarÃ­a revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de recuperaciÃ³n/clasificaciÃ³n [8]. Para una necesidad de informaciÃ³n compleja o difÃ­cil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de informaciÃ³n estÃ© completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperaciÃ³n tan interactivo, la informaciÃ³n naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n es mÃ¡s que solo la consulta de usuario actual y la recopilaciÃ³n de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacciÃ³n puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n, incluidas las consultas anteriores, informaciÃ³n sobre la cualDocumentos El usuario ha elegido ver, e incluso cÃ³mo un usuario ha leÃ­do un documento (por ejemplo, que parte de un documento que el usuario pasa mucho tiempo en lectura). Definimos la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita en tÃ©rminos generales como explotando todo el historial de interacciÃ³n naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de la recuperaciÃ³n. Una ventaja importante de la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita es que podemos mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n sin requerir ningÃºn esfuerzo del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es Java, sin conocer ninguna informaciÃ³n adicional, serÃ­a imposible saber si estÃ¡ destinado a significar el lenguaje de programaciÃ³n de Java o la isla Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, los documentos recuperados probablemente tendrÃ¡n ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programaciÃ³n y otros pueden estar sobre la isla. Sin embargo, cualquier usuario en particular es poco probable que busque ambos tipos de documentos. Tal ambigÃ¼edad se puede resolver explotando la informaciÃ³n del historial. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es la programaciÃ³n CGI, sugerirÃ­a fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programaciÃ³n que el usuario estÃ¡ buscando. La retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita se estudiÃ³ en varios trabajos anteriores. En [11], Joachims explorÃ³ cÃ³mo capturar y explotar la informaciÃ³n de clics y demostrÃ³ que dicha informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita puede mejorar la precisiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizÃ³ un estudio de simulaciÃ³n de la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperaciÃ³n diseÃ±ados para explotar la informaciÃ³n de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperaciÃ³n existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de bÃºsqueda en funciÃ³n del historial de navegaciÃ³n de un usuario. Otro trabajo relacionado sobre el uso del contexto incluye bÃºsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], anÃ¡lisis de registro de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implÃ­citas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en usar informaciÃ³n de clics, en este documento, utilizamos informaciÃ³n de clics y consultas anteriores, y nos centramos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperaciÃ³n. EspecÃ­ficamente, desarrollamos modelos para usar informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, como consulta e historial de clics de la sesiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda actual para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperaciÃ³n de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperaciÃ³n sensible al contexto como estimaciÃ³n de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier informaciÃ³n de contexto de bÃºsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos de lenguaje estadÃ­stico para incorporar la consulta y el historial de clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafÃ­o en el estudio de modelos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos es que no existe una recopilaciÃ³n de pruebas adecuada para la evaluaciÃ³n. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una recopilaciÃ³n de pruebas con informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, que puede usarse para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos. Hasta donde sabemos, esta es la primera prueba establecida para la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n sin requerir un esfuerzo adicional del usuario. Las secciones restantes se organizan de la siguiente manera. En la SecciÃ³n 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita e introducir algunos tÃ©rminos que usaremos mÃ¡s adelante. En la SecciÃ³n 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos basados en modelos de lenguaje estadÃ­stico. En la SecciÃ³n 4, describimos cÃ³mo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos. En la SecciÃ³n 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­citos en el conjunto de datos creado. La SecciÃ³n 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro.2. DefiniciÃ³n del problema Hay dos tipos de informaciÃ³n de contexto que podemos usar para la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la informaciÃ³n circundante inmediata que arroja luz sobre la necesidad actual de la informaciÃ³n actual de los usuarios en una sola sesiÃ³n. Una sesiÃ³n puede considerarse como un perÃ­odo que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de informaciÃ³n. La categorÃ­a de informaciÃ³n de los usuarios necesita (por ejemplo, niÃ±os o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha informaciÃ³n se relaciona mÃ¡s directamente con la necesidad de informaciÃ³n actual del usuario y, por lo tanto, se puede esperar que sea mÃ¡s Ãºtil para mejorar la bÃºsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es mÃ¡s Ãºtil para mejorar la bÃºsqueda en la sesiÃ³n actual, pero puede no ser tan Ãºtil para las actividades de bÃºsqueda en una sesiÃ³n diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a informaciÃ³n como un nivel educativo de usuarios e interÃ©s general, el historial de consultas de usuarios acumulados e informaciÃ³n de clics de los usuarios anteriores;Dicha informaciÃ³n es generalmente estable durante mucho tiempo y a menudo se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda para una sesiÃ³n en particular. En este artÃ­culo, nos centramos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros mÃ©todos tambiÃ©n se pueden usar para incorporar naturalmente algÃºn contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de bÃºsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificarÃ­a continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual QK (a excepciÃ³n de la primera consulta de una sesiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda), hay un historial de consulta, HQ = (Q1, ..., QK - 1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores dadas por elmismo usuario en la sesiÃ³n actual. Tenga en cuenta que suponemos que los lÃ­mites de la sesiÃ³n se conocen en este documento. En la prÃ¡ctica, necesitamos tÃ©cnicas para descubrir automÃ¡ticamente los lÃ­mites de las sesiones, que se han estudiado en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n solo utiliza la consulta actual QK para hacer la recuperaciÃ³n. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas Ãºtiles sobre la necesidad actual de la informaciÃ³n actual de los usuarios como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la secciÃ³n anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo anterior [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es Ãºtil para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la recuperaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s del historial de consultas, puede haber otra informaciÃ³n de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente frecuentemente hace clic en algunos documentos para ver. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el tÃ­tulo, el resumen y quizÃ¡s tambiÃ©n el contenido y la ubicaciÃ³n (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento hecho hecho. Aunque no estÃ¡ claro si un documento visto es realmente relevante para la necesidad de la informaciÃ³n del usuario, podemos asumir de manera segura que la informaciÃ³n de resumen/tÃ­tulo mostrada sobre el documento es atractiva para el usuario, por lo que transmite informaciÃ³n sobre la necesidad de la informaciÃ³n de los usuarios. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la informaciÃ³n de texto que se muestra sobre un documento (generalmente tÃ­tulo y resumen) juntos, tambiÃ©n tendremos un resumen CI en cada ronda de recuperaciÃ³n. En general, podemos tener un historial de resÃºmenes c1, ..., CK - 1. TambiÃ©n explotaremos dicho historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., CK - 1) para mejorar nuestra precisiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda para la consulta actual QK. El trabajo anterior tambiÃ©n ha mostrado resultados positivos utilizando informaciÃ³n de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, que naturalmente existe en la recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n interactiva, por lo tanto, no se necesita ningÃºn esfuerzo adicional para el usuario para recopilarlos. En este documento, estudiamos cÃ³mo explotar dicha informaciÃ³n (HQ y HC), desarrollamos modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una funciÃ³n de clasificaciÃ³n de recuperaciÃ³n y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos.3. Los modelos de lenguaje para contextenciales de informaciÃ³n sensible a la prueba intuitiva de la consulta HQ y el historial de clics HC son Ãºtiles para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda para la consulta actual QK. Una pregunta de investigaciÃ³n importante es cÃ³mo podemos explotar dicha informaciÃ³n de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadÃ­stico para modelar una necesidad de informaciÃ³n de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto especÃ­ficos para incorporar informaciÃ³n de contexto en un modelo de recuperaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica.3.1 Modelo de recuperaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica Usamos el mÃ©todo de divergencia Kullback-Leibbler (KL) [19] como nuestro mÃ©todo de recuperaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica. SegÃºn este modelo, la tarea de recuperaciÃ³n implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta Î¸q para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento Î¸d para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL d (Î¸q || Î¸d), que sirve como la puntuaciÃ³n del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar naturalmente el contexto de bÃºsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimaciÃ³n del modelo de lenguaje de consulta. Formalmente, deje que HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk - 1) sea el historial de consulta y la consulta actual sea QK. Deje que HC = (C1, ..., CK - 1) sea el historial de clics. Tenga en cuenta que CI es la concatenaciÃ³n de todos los resÃºmenes de documentos en la ronda de recuperaciÃ³n, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resÃºmenes por igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos mediante P (W | Î¸k), basado en la consulta actual QK, asÃ­ como en el Histor de la consulta HQ e History History HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de idiomas diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar P (W | Î¸k). Usaremos C (w, x) para denotar el recuento de la palabra w en el texto x, que podrÃ­a ser una consulta o un resumen de documentos haciendo clic o cualquier otro texto. Usaremos | x |para denotar la longitud del texto x o el nÃºmero total de palabras en X. 3.2 InterpolaciÃ³n de coeficiente fijo (fijaciÃ³n) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el HQ del historial de consultas con un modelo de lenguaje unigram P (W | HQ) y la historia de clic HC conOtro modelo de lenguaje unigram P (W | HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos de historia para obtener el modelo de historia P (W | H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia P (W | H) con el modelo de consulta actual P (W | QK). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera.p (w | qi) = c (w, qi) | qi |p (w | hq) = 1 k - 1 i = k - 1 i = 1 p (w | qi) p (w | ci) = c (w, ci) | ci |p (w | hc) = 1 k - 1 i = k - 1 i = 1 p (w | ci) p (w | h) = Î²p (w | hc) + (1 - Î²) p (w | hq)p (w | Î¸k) = Î±p (w | qk) + (1 - Î±) p (w | h) donde Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] es un parÃ¡metro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historia, y donde Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] es un parÃ¡metro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la informaciÃ³n del historial. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p (w | Î¸k) = Î±p (w | qk) + (1 - Î±) [Î²p (w | hc) + (1 - Î²) p (w | hq)] es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es solo una interpolaciÃ³n de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos P (W | QK), P (W | HQ) y P (W | HC).3.3 InterpolaciÃ³n bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque de fijaciÃ³n es que los coeficientes, especialmente Î±, se fijan en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual QK es muy larga, deberÃ­amos confiar mÃ¡s en la consulta actual, mientras que si QK solo tiene una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner mÃ¡s peso en la historia. Para capturar esta intuiciÃ³n, tratamos P (W | HQ) y P (W | HC) como Dirichlet Priors y QK como datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado viene dado por p (w | Î¸k) = c (w, qk) + Âµp (w | hq) + Î½p (w | hc) | qk |+ Âµ + Î½ = | qk || QK |+ Âµ + Î½ p (w | qk) + Âµ + Î½ | qk |+ Âµ + Î½ [Âµ Âµ + Î½ p (w | hq) + Î½ Âµ + Î½ p (w | hc)] donde Âµ es el tamaÃ±o de muestra anterior para p (w | hq) y Î½ es el tamaÃ±o de muestra anterior para p(W | HC). Vemos que la Ãºnica diferencia entre Bayesint y Fixint es que los coeficientes de interpolaciÃ³n ahora se adaptan a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver Bayesint como fijaciÃ³n, vemos que Î± = | qk || QK |+Âµ+Î½, Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ, por lo tanto con Âµ y Î½ fijo, tendremos un Î± dependiente de la consulta. MÃ¡s tarde mostraremos que un Î± tan adaptativo funciona empÃ­ricamente mejor que un Î± fijo.3.4 ActualizaciÃ³n bayesiana en lÃ­nea (en lÃ­nea) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resuman la informaciÃ³n del historial promediando los modelos de idiomas unigram estimados en funciÃ³n de consultas anteriores o resÃºmenes. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual y, por lo tanto, se hacen clic en los resÃºmenes. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactÃºa con el sistema y adquiere mÃ¡s conocimiento sobre la informaciÃ³n en la recopilaciÃ³n, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarÃ¡n cada vez mÃ¡s. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos en descomposiciÃ³n a las consultas anteriores para confiar en una consulta reciente mÃ¡s que una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Curiosamente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de la informaciÃ³n de los usuarios despuÃ©s de ver cada consulta, naturalmente podrÃ­amos obtener pesos en descomposiciÃ³n en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualizaciÃ³n en lÃ­nea incremental puede usarse para explotar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperaciÃ³n interactivo, la presentamos de una manera mÃ¡s general. En un sistema de recuperaciÃ³n tÃ­pico, el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar los documentos, el sistema debe tener algÃºn modelo para la necesidad de informaciÃ³n de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperaciÃ³n de divergencia KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta siempre que un usuario ingrese una consulta (nueva). Una forma principalmente de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimaciÃ³n bayesiana, que discutimos a continuaciÃ³n.3.4.1 ActualizaciÃ³n bayesiana Primero discutimos cÃ³mo aplicamos la estimaciÃ³n bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea P (W | Ï†) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y t sea una nueva evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen en el que se hace clic). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en t, usamos Ï† para definir un Dirichlet previamente parametrizado como Dir (Âµt p (w1 | Ï†), ..., Âµt p (wn | Ï†)) donde Âµt es el tamaÃ±o de muestra equivalente delprevio. Usamos Dirichlet Prior porque es un conjugado anterior para distribuciones multinomiales. Con tal conjugado anterior, la distribuciÃ³n predictiva de Ï† (o de manera equivalente, la media de la distribuciÃ³n posterior de Ï† viene dada por p (w | Ï†) = c (w, t) + Âµt p (w | Ï†) | t |+ Âµt (1) donde c (w, t) es el recuento de w en t y | t | es la longitud de T. parÃ¡metro Âµt indica nuestra confianza en el anterior expresado en tÃ©rminos de una muestra de texto equivalente comparable con T. para T.Ejemplo, Âµt = 1 indica que la influencia del anterior es equivalente a agregar una palabra adicional a T. 3.4.2 ActualizaciÃ³n del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cÃ³mo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta a lo largo del tiempo durante un proceso de recuperaciÃ³n interactivo utilizando la estimaciÃ³n bayesiana. En general, suponemos que el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n mantiene un modelo de consulta actual Ï†i en cualquier momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita en forma de una pieza de texto TI, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos informaciÃ³n sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener informaciÃ³n sobre quÃ© documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha informaciÃ³n para definir un anterior en el modelo de consulta, que se denota por Ï†0. DespuÃ©s de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado Ï†1 se puede usar para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario ve algunos documentos, el texto de resumen mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resÃºmenes en los que se hace clic) puede servir como algunos datos nuevos para que actualicemos aÃºn mÃ¡s el modelo de consulta para obtener Ï†1. A medida que obtenemos la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar Ï†1 para obtener un nuevo modelo Ï†2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualizaciÃ³n para actualizar iterativamente el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualizaciÃ³n: (1) actualizaciÃ³n basada en una nueva consulta Qi;(2) ActualizaciÃ³n basada en un nuevo resumen de CI. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como un modelo previo del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o hacer clic en el resumen como datos observados. Por lo tanto, tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualizaciÃ³n: P (W | Ï†i) = C (W, Qi) + ÂµIP (W | Ï†i - 1) | Qi |+ Âµi p (w | Ï†i) = c (w, ci) + Î½ip (w | Ï†i) | Ci |+ Î½i donde ÂµI es el tamaÃ±o de muestra equivalente para el anterior cuando se actualiza el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que Î½i es el tamaÃ±o de muestra equivalente para el anterior cuando se actualiza el modelo basado en un resumen haciendo clic. Si establecemos Âµi = 0 (o Î½i = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo anterior, por lo tanto, iniciarÃ­a un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen de resumen hecho). Por otro lado, si establecemos Âµi = +âˆž (o Î½i = +âˆž) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen haciendo clic) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo sigue siendo el mismo que si no observamos ninguna evidencia de texto nueva. En general, los parÃ¡metros ÂµI y Î½i pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, podemos tener un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo que podrÃ­amos usar un ÂµI mÃ¡s pequeÃ±o, pero mÃ¡s tarde como el historial de consultas es mÃ¡s rico, podemos considerar usar un ÂµI mÃ¡s grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indiquen lo contrario, los colocamos en las mismas constantes, es decir, âˆ€i, j, Âµi = ÂµJ, Î½i = Î½J. Tenga en cuenta que podemos tomar P (W | Ï†i) o P (W | Ï†i) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para documentos de clasificaciÃ³n. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar hasta que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperaciÃ³n;En su lugar, tan pronto como recolectamos un resumen de CI, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar P (w | Ï†i) para volver a relacionar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aÃºn no haya visto. Para calificar documentos despuÃ©s de ver la consulta QK, usamos P (W | Ï†k), es decir, P (W | Î¸k) = P (W | Ï†k) 3.5 ActualizaciÃ³n bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp) Si establecemos los parÃ¡metros de tamaÃ±o de muestra equivalentes en constante fijo., el algoritmo en lÃ­nea introducirÃ­a un factor en descomposiciÃ³n: la interpolaciÃ³n repetida harÃ­a que los datos tempranos tengan un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario se vuelve cada vez mejor en la formulaciÃ³n de la consulta a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la informaciÃ³n de clics, especialmente porque usamos el resumen mostrado, en lugar deEl contenido real de un documento haciendo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolaciÃ³n en descomposiciÃ³n a los datos de clics es hacer en lÃ­nea solo para el historial de consulta Q = (Q1, ..., Qi - 1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero amortamos todos los datos de clics.Juntos y usen toda la parte de los datos de clic para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecuciÃ³n de OnlineUP en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualizaciÃ³n son las siguientes.p (w | Ï†i) = c (w, qi) + Âµip (w | Ï†i - 1) | qi |+ Âµi p (w | Ïˆi) = i - 1 j = 1 c (w, cj) + Î½ip (w | Ï†i) i - 1 j = 1 | cj |+ Î½i donde ÂµI tiene la misma interpretaciÃ³n que en onlineup, pero ahora indica en quÃ© medida queremos confiar en los resÃºmenes haciendo clic. Como en OnlineUP, establecemos todos los Âµis y Î½is al mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos despuÃ©s de ver la consulta actual QK, usamos P (W | Î¸k) = P (W | Ïˆk) 4. RecopilaciÃ³n de datos Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino tambiÃ©n el historial de consulta y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no hay dicho conjunto de datos disponible para nosotros, tenemos que crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Una es extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado e historial de clic para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperaciÃ³n (por ejemplo, motor de bÃºsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre dichos datos. La otra opciÃ³n es usar un conjunto de datos TREC, que tiene una base de datos de texto, descripciÃ³n del tema y archivo de juicio de relevancia. Desafortunadamente, no hay historial de consultas ni datos de historial de clics. Decidimos aumentar un conjunto de datos TREC recopilando el historial de consultas y los datos del historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de datos de texto, porque los datos AP se han utilizado en varias tareas TREC y tiene juicios relativamente completos. Hay artÃ­culos de noticias en total 242918 y la longitud promedio del documento es de 416 palabras. La mayorÃ­a de los artÃ­culos tienen tÃ­tulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oraciÃ³n del texto como tÃ­tulo. Para el preprocesamiento, solo hacemos plegamiento de casos y no hacemos la eliminaciÃ³n de la palabra de parada o las derivaciones. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difÃ­ciles de TREC TEMICS 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisiÃ³n entre los temas de TREC 1-150 de acuerdo con algunos experimentos de lÃ­nea de base utilizando el modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado bayesiano [20]. La razÃ³n por la que seleccionamos temas difÃ­ciles es que el usuario tendrÃ­a que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperaciÃ³n para obtener resultados satisfactorios para que podamos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas relativamente mÃ¡s rico y los datos del historial de clics del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, tambiÃ©n podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean mÃ¡s Ãºtiles para temas tan difÃ­ciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recopilaciÃ³n de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexemos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de bÃºsqueda y una interfaz web para artÃ­culos de noticias TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para hacer experimentos para recopilar el historial de consultas y los datos del historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asigna 10 temas y dadas las descripciones del tema proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el tÃ­tulo del tema dado en la descripciÃ³n original del tema TREC. DespuÃ©s de que el sujeto presente la consulta, el motor de bÃºsqueda harÃ¡ recuperaciÃ³n y devolverÃ¡ una lista clasificada de resultados de bÃºsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto navegarÃ¡ por los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o mÃ¡s resultados para explorar el texto completo de los artÃ­culos. El sujeto tambiÃ©n puede modificar la consulta para hacer otra bÃºsqueda. Para cada tema, el tema compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el nÃºmero de tema de un menÃº de selecciÃ³n antes de enviar la consulta al motor de bÃºsqueda para que podamos detectar fÃ¡cilmente el lÃ­mite de la sesiÃ³n, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones del usuario, incluidas las consultas enviadas y los documentos haciendo clic. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los tÃ©rminos de consulta y las pÃ¡ginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento haciendo clic, almacenamos el resumen como se muestra en la pÃ¡gina de resultados de bÃºsqueda. El resumen del artÃ­culo depende de la consulta y se calcula en lÃ­nea utilizando la recuperaciÃ³n de pasaje de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado bayesiano). Entre las 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de la consulta es de 3.71 palabras. En total, hay 91 documentos que se hacen clic para ver. Entonces, en promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema. La longitud promedio de la consulta de resumen de resumen en lÃ­nea en lÃ­nea de la consulta de lotes (Î± = 0.1, Î² = 1.0) (Âµ = 0.2, Î½ = 5.0) (Âµ = 5.0, Î½ = 15.0) (Âµ = 2.0, Î½ = 15.0) Map@20docs mapa pr@20docs mapa pr@20 docs map pr@20docs Q1 0.0095 0.0317 0.0095 0.0317 0.0095 0.0317 0.0095 0.0317 Q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + hc 0.0311117 0.031110 0.03110 0.031110 0.031110 0.031141110 0.031110 0.031110 0.0311411141110 0.03114111111 215 0.0733 0.0342 0.1100 Mejorar.3.8% -2.9% 10.6% -2.9% -31.1% -36.3% 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ + HC 0.0726 0.1967 0.0816 0.2067 0.0706 0.1783 0.0810 0.2067 Improve 72.4% 32.6% 93.8%39.4% 67.7% 20.2% 92.4% 39.4% Q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 Q4 + HQ + HC 0.0891 0.2233 0.0955 0.2317 0.0792 0.2067 0.0950 0.2250. 9% 47.8% 6.9% 77.2% 16.4% Tabla1: Efecto del uso del historial de consultas y los datos de clic para la clasificaciÃ³n de documentos.son 34.4 palabras. Entre 91 documentos haciendo clic, 29 documentos se juzgan relevantes de acuerdo con el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos estÃ¡ disponible pÃºblicamente 1.5. Experimentos 5.1 DiseÃ±o del experimento Nuestra hipÃ³tesis principal es que el uso del contexto de bÃºsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas e informaciÃ³n de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisiÃ³n de la bÃºsqueda. En particular, el contexto de bÃºsqueda puede proporcionar informaciÃ³n adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un mejor modelo de consulta que usar solo la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayorÃ­a de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando asÃ­ cualquier contexto) con eso utilizando la consulta actual y el contexto de bÃºsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, hacemos tales comparaciones para cada versiÃ³n de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) PrecisiÃ³n promedio media (MAP): esta es la precisiÃ³n promedio no interpolada estÃ¡ndar y sirve como una buena medida de la precisiÃ³n general de clasificaciÃ³n.(2) PrecisiÃ³n a 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es mÃ¡s significativa que el mapa y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los 20 documentos principales. En todos los casos, la cifra informada es el promedio sobre los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de bÃºsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, Onlineup y Batchup). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parÃ¡metros (Î± y Î² para fijaciÃ³n; Âµ y Î½ para otros). Tenga en cuenta que Âµ y Î½ pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes mÃ©todos. Varimos estos parÃ¡metros e identificamos el rendimiento Ã³ptimo para cada mÃ©todo. TambiÃ©n variamos los parÃ¡metros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuraciÃ³n de los parÃ¡metros.5.2 AnÃ¡lisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de bÃºsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento Ã³ptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que usan la consulta actual solo en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con Qi es el rendimiento de lÃ­nea de base y una fila etiquetada con Qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento de usar el contexto de bÃºsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones de esta tabla: 1. La comparaciÃ³n de las actuaciones de referencia indica que en promedio las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores con el desempeÃ±o de que Q4 es el mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan mejores y mejores consultas.2. El uso del contexto de bÃºsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede ver por el hecho de que la 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/qchistory.zip, la mejora para Q4 y Q3 es generalmente mÃ¡s sustancial en comparaciÃ³n con Q2. En realidad, en muchos casos con Q2, usar el contexto puede daÃ±ar el rendimiento, probablemente porque la historia en ese punto es escasa. Cuando el contexto de bÃºsqueda es rico, la mejora del rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, Batchup logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisiÃ³n promedio media sobre el Q3 y el 77.2% de mejora con respecto a Q4.(Sin embargo, las precisiones generalmente bajas tambiÃ©n hacen que la mejora relativa sea engaÃ±osamente alta, sin embargo.) 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que usan el contexto de bÃºsqueda, las actuaciones de FixTint y Onlineup son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y Batchup. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que la fijaciÃ³n y la principal diferencia entre Bayesint y Fixint es que el primero usa un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolaciÃ³n, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y una interpolaciÃ³n de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre Onlineup y Batchup es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes de descomposiciÃ³n para combinar los mÃºltiples resÃºmenes haciendo clic, mientras que Batchup simplemente concatena todos los resÃºmenes haciendo clic. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que en lÃ­nea indica que los pesos para combinar los resÃºmenes haciendo clic en realidad no deberÃ­an estar en descomposiciÃ³n. Si bien OnlineUp es teÃ³ricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior a Bayesint y Batchup, probablemente debido al coeficiente en descomposiciÃ³n. En general, Batchup parece ser el mejor mÃ©todo cuando variamos la configuraciÃ³n de los parÃ¡metros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de bÃºsqueda: el historial de consultas y los datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribuciÃ³n de cada tipo de contexto.5.2.2 Utilizando el historial de consultas solo en cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos del historial de clics configurando los parÃ¡metros de manera adecuada. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de usar el historial de consultas solo. Utilizamos la misma configuraciÃ³n de parÃ¡metros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. AquÃ­ vemos que, en general, el beneficio de usar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto es diferente de lo que se informa en un estudio anterior [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas es consistentemente Ãºtil. Otra observaciÃ³n es que las ejecuciones de contexto funcionan mal en Q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que las lÃ­neas de base para Q3 y Q4. Esto es nuevamente probable porque al principio la consulta inicial, que es el tÃ­tulo en la descripciÃ³n del tema original de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta;De hecho, en promedio, las actuaciones de estas consultas de primera generaciÃ³n son claramente mÃ¡s pobres que las de todas las demÃ¡s consultas formuladas por el usuario en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observaciÃ³n mÃ¡s es que cuando se usa el historial de consultas solamente, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, en lÃ­nea y la consulta de Batchint Batchint Bayesint en lÃ­nea (Î± = 0.1, Î² = 0) (Âµ = 0.2, Î½ = 0) (Âµ = 5.0, Î½ = +âˆž) (Âµ = 2.0, Î½ = =+ âˆž) Map PR@20Docs Map PR@20Docs Map PR@20Docs Map PR@20Docs Q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 Q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 mejora.-68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Improve -38.2% -38.2%7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% Q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 Q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 mejoran % 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto del uso del historial de consultas solo para la clasificaciÃ³n de documentos.Âµ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.05520.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: PrecisiÃ³n promedio de Batchup usando el historial de consultas Solo son esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan asÃ­ la variaciÃ³n causada por el parÃ¡metro Âµ. Una configuraciÃ³n mÃ¡s pequeÃ±a de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor mayor de 5.0. Se puede ver una imagen mÃ¡s completa de la influencia de la configuraciÃ³n de Âµ en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango mÃ¡s amplio de valores de Âµ. El valor de Âµ se puede interpretar como cuÃ¡ntas palabras consideramos el historial de consultas. Un valor mayor, por lo tanto, pone mÃ¡s peso en la historia y se considera que duele mÃ¡s el rendimiento cuando la informaciÃ³n del historial no es rica. Por lo tanto, mientras que para Q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para Âµ âˆˆ [2, 5], solo cuando Âµ = 0.5 vemos un pequeÃ±o beneficio para Q2. Como es de esperar, un Âµ excesivamente grande daÃ±arÃ­a el rendimiento en general, pero el Q2 se duele mÃ¡s y Q4 apenas se duele, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos mÃ¡s y mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre el historial de consultas, podemos poner mÃ¡s y mÃ¡s peso sobre la informaciÃ³n del historial. Esto tambiÃ©n sugiere que una mejor estrategia probablemente deberÃ­a ajustar dinÃ¡micamente los parÃ¡metros de acuerdo con la cantidad de informaciÃ³n del historial que tenemos. Los resultados del historial de consultas mixtas sugieren que el efecto positivo del uso de la informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita puede provenir en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto como discutimos en la prÃ³xima subsecciÃ³n.5.2.3 Usando el historial de clics solo ahora apagamos el historial de consultas y solo usamos los resÃºmenes haciendo clic mÃ¡s la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de usar informaciÃ³n de clics es mucho mÃ¡s significativo que el de usar el historial de consultas. Vemos un efecto positivo general, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre la lÃ­nea de base. TambiÃ©n estÃ¡ claro que cuanto mÃ¡s ricos sean los datos del contexto, mÃ¡s mejora utilizando resÃºmenes haciendo clic. Aparte de una degradaciÃ³n ocasional de precisiÃ³n en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y, a menudo, bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto de resumen hecho hecho es en general bastante Ãºtil para inferir una necesidad de la informaciÃ³n del usuario. Intuitivamente, utilizando el texto resumido, en lugar del contenido real del documento, tiene mÃ¡s sentido, ya que es muy posible que el documento detrÃ¡s de un resumen aparentemente relevante sea realmente no relevante.29 de los 91 documentos haciendo clic son relevantes. La actualizaciÃ³n del modelo de consulta basado en tales resÃºmenes elevarÃ­a los rangos de estos documentos relevantes, causando una mejora del rendimiento. Sin embargo, dicha mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuÃ¡nta mejora hemos logrado para mejorar los rangos de los documentos relevantes invisibles, excluyimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recomputamos el desempeÃ±o de BayesInt y la lÃ­nea de base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Tenga en cuenta que el rendimiento del mÃ©todo de referencia es menor debido a la eliminaciÃ³n de los 29 documentos relevantes, que generalmente se habrÃ­an clasificado en los resultados. De la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resÃºmenes haciendo clic tambiÃ©n ayuda a mejorar significativamente las filas de documentos relevantes invisibles.

Para responder a esta pregunta, sacamos los 29 resÃºmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto mÃ¡s pequeÃ±o de resÃºmenes HC y reevaluamos el rendimiento del mÃ©todo BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuraciÃ³n de parÃ¡metros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisiÃ³n promedio se mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan en solo 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, un usuario es mÃ¡s probable que haga clic en algunos resÃºmenes relevantes, lo que ayudarÃ­a a traer documentos mÃ¡s relevantes como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5.

En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el mÃ©todo Batchup.5.2.5 Sensibilidad de parÃ¡metros Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parÃ¡metros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y QK, aunque la parametrizaciÃ³n es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsecciÃ³n, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parÃ¡metros para Batchup, que parece funcionar relativamente mejor que otros. Batchup tiene dos parÃ¡metros Âµ y Î½. Primero miramos Âµ. Cuando Âµ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se usa en absoluto, y esencialmente usamos los datos de clic combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos Âµ, incorporaremos gradualmente mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cÃ³mo cambia la precisiÃ³n promedio de Batchup a medida que variamos Âµ con Î½ fijado a 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de Batchup. Vemos que el rendimiento es mayormente insensible al cambio de Âµ para Q3 y Q4, pero estÃ¡ disminuyendo a medida que Âµ aumenta para Q2. El patrÃ³n tambiÃ©n es similar cuando establecemos Î½ en otros valores. AdemÃ¡s del hecho de que Q1 es generalmente peor que Q2, Q3 y Q4, otra posible razÃ³n por la cual la sensibilidad es menor para Q3 y Q4 puede ser que generalmente tenemos mÃ¡s datos de clic disponibles para Q3 y Q4 que para Q2 y elLa influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho las pequeÃ±as diferencias causadas por Âµ menos visibles para Q3 y Q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando Âµ es alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la informaciÃ³n de consulta pasada es tan Ãºtil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por Q2, claramente existe cierta compensaciÃ³n entre la consulta actual y el mapa de consultas de consultas anteriores PR@20DOCS Q2 0.0312 0.1150 Q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora.-8.0% -15.9% Q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora.10.3% 1.5% Q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejorar.9.6% -4.3% Q3 0.0421 0.1483 Q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejorar 8.1% -2.2% Q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejorar 21.9% 11.3% Q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejorar 92.4% 39.4% Q4 0.0536 0.1930 Q4 + HQ + HQ + HQ + HQ3.0% -0.8% Q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% Q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: beneficio aditivo de la informaciÃ³n de contexto y el uso de una combinaciÃ³n equilibrada de ellos logran un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno de ellossolo. Ahora pasamos al otro parÃ¡metro Î½. Cuando Î½ estÃ¡ configurado en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics;Cuando Î½ se establece en +âˆž, solo usamos el historial de consulta y la consulta actual. Con Âµ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de Batchup, variamos Î½ y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando Î½ â‰¤ 30, con el mejor rendimiento a menudo logrado en Î½ = 15. Esto significa que la informaciÃ³n combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan Ãºtil como unas 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la informaciÃ³n de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que Batchup no solo funciona mejor que otros mÃ©todos, sino que tambiÃ©n es bastante robusto.6. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento, hemos explorado cÃ³mo explotar la informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, incluido el historial de consultas y el historial de clics dentro de la misma sesiÃ³n de bÃºsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n de la informaciÃ³n. Utilizando el modelo de recuperaciÃ³n de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos de lenguaje estadÃ­stico para la recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, Onlineup y Batchup.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de la retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n sin requerir ningÃºn esfuerzo adicional del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede extender de varias maneras: primero, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar informaciÃ³n de retroalimentaciÃ³n implÃ­cita. SerÃ­a interesante desarrollar modelos mÃ¡s sofisticados para explotar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar un resumen hecho de manera diferente dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalizaciÃ³n o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. En segundo lugar, los modelos propuestos se pueden implementar en cualquier sistema prÃ¡ctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de bÃºsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporarÃ¡ algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. TambiÃ©n haremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la bÃºsqueda web real. Finalmente, debemos estudiar mÃ¡s a fondo un marco de recuperaciÃ³n general para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n interactiva y estudiar cÃ³mo optimizar algunos de los parÃ¡metros en los modelos de recuperaciÃ³n sensibles al contexto.7.

        "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
        "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
        "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
        "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
        "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
        "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
        "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
        "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
        "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
        "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
        "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
        "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
        "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
        "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
        "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
        "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
        "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
        "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
        "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
        "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
        "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
        "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
        "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
        "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
        "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
        "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
        "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
        "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
        "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
        "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
        "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
        "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
        "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
        "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
        "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
        "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
        "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
        "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
        "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
        "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
        "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
        "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
        "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
        "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
        "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
        "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
        "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
        "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
        "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
        "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
        "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
        "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
        "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
        "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
        "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
        "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
        "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
        "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
        "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
        "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
        "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
        "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
        "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
        "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
        "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
        "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
        "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
        "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
        "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
        "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
        "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
        "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
        "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
        "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
        "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
        "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
        "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
        "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
        "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
        "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
        "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
        "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
        "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
        "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
        "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
        "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
        "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
        "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
        "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
        "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
        "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
        "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
        "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
        "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
        "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
        "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
        "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
        "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
        "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
        "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
        "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
        "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
        "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
        "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
        "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
        "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
        "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
        "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
        "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
        "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
        "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
        "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
        "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
        "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
        "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
        "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
        "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
        "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
        "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
        "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
        "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
        "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
        "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
        "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
        "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
        "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
        "There are two choices.",
        "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
        "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
        "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
        "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",
        "There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words.",
        "Most articles have titles.",
        "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
        "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",
        "We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150.",
        "These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20].",
        "The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user.",
        "In real applications, we may also expect our models to be most useful for such difficult topics, so our data collection strategy reflects the real world applications well.",
        "We index the TREC AP data set and set up a search engine and web interface for TREC AP news articles.",
        "We use 3 subjects to do experiments to collect query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "Each subject is assigned 10 topics and given the topic descriptions provided by TREC.",
        "For each topic, the first query is the title of the topic given in the original TREC topic description.",
        "After the subject submits the query, the search engine will do retrieval and return a ranked list of search results to the subject.",
        "The subject will browse the results and maybe click one or more results to browse the full text of article(s).",
        "The subject may also modify the query to do another search.",
        "For each topic, the subject composes at least 4 queries.",
        "In our experiment, only the first 4 queries for each topic are used.",
        "The user needs to select the topic number from a selection menu before submitting the query to the search engine so that we can easily detect the session boundary, which is not the focus of our study.",
        "We use a relational database to store user interactions, including the submitted queries and clicked documents.",
        "For each query, we store the query terms and the associated result pages.",
        "And for each clicked document, we store the summary as shown on the search result page.",

        "Each model has precisely two parameters (Î± and Î² for FixInt; Âµ and Î½ for others).",
        "Note that Âµ and Î½ may need to be interpreted differently for different methods.",
        "We vary these parameters and identify the optimal performance for each method.",
        "We also vary the parameters to study the sensitivity of our algorithms to the setting of the parameters. 5.2 Result analysis 5.2.1 Overall effect of search context We compare the optimal performances of four models with those using the current query only in Table 1.",
        "A row labeled with qi is the baseline performance and a row labeled with qi + HQ + HC is the performance of using search context.",
        "We can make several observations from this table: 1.",
        "Comparing the baseline performances indicates that on average reformulated queries are better than the previous queries with the performance of q4 being the best.",
        "Users generally formulate better and better queries. 2.",
        "Using search context generally has positive effect, especially when the context is rich.",
        "This can be seen from the fact that the 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip improvement for q4 and q3 is generally more substantial compared with q2.",
        "Actually, in many cases with q2, using the context may hurt the performance, probably because the history at that point is sparse.",
        "When the search context is rich, the performance improvement can be quite substantial.",
        "For example, BatchUp achieves 92.4% improvement in the mean average precision over q3 and 77.2% improvement over q4. (The generally low precisions also make the relative improvement deceptively high, though.) 3.",
        "Among the four models using search context, the performances of FixInt and OnlineUp are clearly worse than those of BayesInt and BatchUp.",
        "Since BayesInt performs better than FixInt and the main difference between BayesInt and FixInt is that the former uses an adaptive coefficient for interpolation, the results suggest that using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a Bayesian style interpolation makes sense.",
        "The main difference between OnlineUp and BatchUp is that OnlineUp uses decaying coefficients to combine the multiple clicked summaries, while BatchUp simply concatenates all clicked summaries.",
        "Therefore the fact that BatchUp is consistently better than OnlineUp indicates that the weights for combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying.",
        "While OnlineUp is theoretically appealing, its performance is inferior to BayesInt and BatchUp, likely because of the decaying coefficient.",
        "Overall, BatchUp appears to be the best method when we vary the parameter settings.",
        "We have two different kinds of search context - query history and clickthrough data.",
        "We now look into the contribution of each kind of context. 5.2.2 Using query history only In each of four models, we can turn off the clickthrough history data by setting parameters appropriately.",
        "This allows us to evaluate the effect of using query history alone.",
        "We use the same parameter setting for query history as in Table 1.",
        "The results are shown in Table 2.",
        "Here we see that in general, the benefit of using query history is very limited with mixed results.",
        "This is different from what is reported in a previous study [15], where using query history is consistently helpful.",
        "Another observation is that the context runs perform poorly at q2, but generally perform (slightly) better than the baselines for q3 and q4.",
        "This is again likely because at the beginning the initial query, which is the title in the original TREC topic description, may not be a good query; indeed, on average, performances of these first-generation queries are clearly poorer than those of all other user-formulated queries in the later generations.",

        "In addition to the fact that q1 is generally worse than q2, q3, and q4, another possible reason why the sensitivity is lower for q3 and q4 may be that we generally have more clickthrough data available for q3 and q4 than for q2, and the dominating influence of the clickthrough data has made the small differences caused by Âµ less visible for q3 and q4.",

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve <br>retrieval accuracy</br> in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve <br>retrieval accuracy</br>, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving <br>retrieval accuracy</br>.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the <br>retrieval accuracy</br> without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve <br>retrieval accuracy</br>.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving <br>retrieval accuracy</br>.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",
                "There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words.",
                "Most articles have titles.",
                "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
                "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",

                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",

                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",

                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are <br>implicit feedback information</br>, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "<br>relevance feedback</br> [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, <br>relevance feedback</br> requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of <br>relevance feedback</br> may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",

                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",

                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",

                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",

                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an <br>interactive retrieval</br> system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an <br>interactive retrieval</br> process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",

                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",

                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",

                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",

                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",

                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific <br>context-sensitive language</br> models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is <br>long-term context</br>, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "<br>long-term context</br> can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some <br>long-term context</br>.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",

                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",

                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",

                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of <br>short-term context</br>.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, <br>short-term context</br> is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the <br>short-term context</br> in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the <br>short-term context</br>, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other <br>short-term context</br> information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",

                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",

                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",

                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 <br>fixed coefficient interpolation</br> (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a <br>fixed coefficient interpolation</br> of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",

                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",

                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use <br>bayesian estimation</br>, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply <br>bayesian estimation</br> to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using <br>bayesian estimation</br>.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "Most articles have titles.",
                "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
                "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",

                "The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user.",

                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",

                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",

                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",

                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",

                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",

                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the <br>current query</br> Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the <br>current query</br> Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the <br>current query</br> Qk.",

                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",

                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the <br>current query</br> model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the <br>current query</br> and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our <br>current query</br> Qk is very long, we should trust the <br>current query</br> more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our <br>current query</br> model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a <br>current query</br> model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the <br>current query</br> Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user <br>clickthrough information</br>; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the <br>clickthrough information</br>, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",

                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user <br>query history</br> and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a <br>query history</br>, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term <br>query history</br> clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term <br>query history</br> is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the <br>query history</br>, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the <br>query history</br> HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the <br>query history</br> and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the <br>query history</br> HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the <br>query history</br> HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse <br>query history</br>, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the <br>query history</br> is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the <br>query history</br> as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the <br>query history</br> Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",

                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional <br>context</br> information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, <br>context</br>-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of <br>context</br> that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more <br>context</br> of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using <br>context</br> includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], <br>context</br> factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new <br>context</br>-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat <br>context</br>-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search <br>context</br> information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",

                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term <br>context</br>.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term <br>context</br> is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of <br>context</br> is long-term <br>context</br>, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term <br>context</br> can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term <br>context</br> in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term <br>context</br>, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term <br>context</br>.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term <br>context</br> information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific <br>context</br>-sensitive language models to incorporate <br>context</br> information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model Î¸Q for a given query and a document language model Î¸D for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(Î¸Q||Î¸D), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search <br>context</br> as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qkâˆ’1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ckâˆ’1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a <br>context</br> query model, which we denote by p(w|Î¸k), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|Î¸k).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k âˆ’ 1 i=kâˆ’1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ) p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)p(w|H) where Î² âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|Î¸k) = Î±p(w|Qk) + (1 âˆ’ Î±)[Î²p(w|HC ) + (1 âˆ’ Î²)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated <br>context</br> query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially Î±, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a <br>context</br> query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|Î¸k) = c(w, Qk) + Âµp(w|HQ) + Î½p(w|HC ) |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ = |Qk| |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ p(w|Qk)+ Âµ + Î½ |Qk| + Âµ + Î½ [ Âµ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HQ)+ Î½ Âµ + Î½ p(w|HC )] where Âµ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and Î½ is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that Î± = |Qk| |Qk|+Âµ+Î½ , Î² = Î½ Î½+Âµ , thus with fixed Âµ and Î½, we will have a query-dependent Î±.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive Î± empirically performs better than a fixed Î±. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|Ï†) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use Ï† to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(ÂµT p(w1|Ï†), ..., ÂµT p(wN |Ï†)) where ÂµT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of Ï† (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of Ï† is given by p(w|Ï†) = c(w, T) + ÂµT p(w|Ï†) |T| + ÂµT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter ÂµT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, ÂµT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model Ï†i at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by Ï†0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model Ï†1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain Ï†1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update Ï†1 to obtain a new model Ï†2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the <br>context</br> query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Ci) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) |Ci| + Î½i where Âµi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while Î½i is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set Âµi = 0 (or Î½i = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set Âµi = +âˆž (or Î½i = +âˆž) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters Âµi and Î½i may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller Âµi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger Âµi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., âˆ€i, j, Âµi = Âµj, Î½i = Î½j.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|Ï†i) or p(w|Ï†i) as our <br>context</br> query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|Ï†i) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|Ï†k), i.e., p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ï†k) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qiâˆ’1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|Ï†i) = c(w, Qi) + Âµip(w|Ï†iâˆ’1) |Qi| + Âµi p(w|Ïˆi) = iâˆ’1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + Î½ip(w|Ï†i) iâˆ’1 j=1 |Cj| + Î½i where Âµi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but Î½i now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all Âµis and Î½is to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|Î¸k) = p(w|Ïˆk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",
                "There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words.",
                "Most articles have titles.",
                "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
                "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",
                "We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150.",
                "These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20].",
                "The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user.",
