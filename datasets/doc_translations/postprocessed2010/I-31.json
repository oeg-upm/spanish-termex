The recently emerging field of judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective, and considers how multiple sets of logical formulae can be aggregated to a single consistent set. As a special case, judgment aggregation can be seen to subsume classical preference aggregation. We present a modal logic that is intended to support reasoning about judgment aggregation scenarios (and hence, as a special case, about preference aggregation): the logical language is interpreted directly in judgment aggregation rules. We present a sound and complete axiomatisation of such rules. We show that the logic can express aggregation rules such as majority voting; rule properties such as independence; and results such as the discursive paradox, Arrows theorem and Condorcets paradox - which are derivable as formal theorems of the logic. The logic is parameterised in such a way that it can be used as a general framework for comparing the logical properties of different types of aggregation - including classical preference aggregation.

INTRODUCTION In this paper, we are interested in knowledge representation formalisms for systems in which agents need to aggregate their preferences, judgments, beliefs, etc. For example, an agent may need to reason about majority voting in a group he is a member of. Preference aggregation - combining individuals preference relations over some set of alternatives into a preference relation which represents the joint preferences of the group by so-called social welfare functions - has been extensively studied in social choice theory [2]. The recently emerging field of judgment aggregation studies aggregation from a logical perspective, and discusses how, given a consistent set of logical formulae for each agent, representing the agents beliefs or judgments, we can aggregate these to a single consistent set of formulae. A variety of judgment aggregation rules have been developed to this end. As a special case, judgment aggregation can be seen to subsume preference aggregation [5]. In this paper we present a logic, called Judgment Aggregation Logic (jal), for reasoning about judgment aggregation. The formulae of the logic are interpreted as statements about judgment aggregation rules, and we give a sound and complete axiomatisation of all such rules. The axiomatisation is parameterised in such a way that we can instantiate it to get a range of different judgment aggregation logics. For example, one instance is an axiomatisation, in our language, of all social welfare functions - thus we get a logic of classical preference aggregation as well. And this is one of the main contributions of this paper: we identify the logical properties of judgment aggregation, and we can compare the logical properties of different classes of judgment aggregation - and of general judgment aggregation and preference aggregation in particular. Of course, a logic is only interesting as long as it is expressive. One of the goals of this paper is to investigate the representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and preference aggregation; that is, what kind of logical language might be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation? An agents knowledge representation language should be able to express: common aggregation rules such as majority voting; commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and social welfare functions such as independence; paradoxes commonly used to illustrate judgment aggregation and preference aggregation, viz. the discursive paradox and Condorcets paradox respectively; and other important properties such as Arrows theorem. In order to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be able to express, take the example of a potential property of social welfare functions (SWFs) called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): given two preference profiles (each consisting of one preference relation for each agent) and two alternatives, if for each agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference profiles, then the two alternatives must have the same order in the two preference relations resulting from applying the SWF to the two preference profiles, respectively. From this example it seems that a formal language for SWFs should be able to express: 566 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS • Quantification on several levels: over alternatives; over preference profiles, i.e., over relations over alternatives (secondorder quantification); and over agents. • Properties of preference relations for different agents, and properties of several different preference relations for the same agent in the same formula. • Comparison of different preference relations. • The preference relation resulting from applying a SWF to other preference relations. From these points it might seem that such a language would be rather complex (in particular, these requirements seem to rule out a standard propositional modal logic). Perhaps surprisingly, the language of jal is syntactically and semantically rather simple; and yet the language is, nevertheless, expressive enough to give elegant and succinct expressions of, e.g., IIA, majority voting, the discursive dilemma, Condorcets paradox and Arrows theorem. This means, for example, that Arrows theorem is a formal theorem of jal, i.e., a derivable formula; we thus have a formal proof theory for social choice. The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. In the next section we review the basics of judgment aggregation as well as preference aggregation, and mention some commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules and social welfare functions. In Section 3 we introduce the syntax and semantics of jal, and study the complexity of the model checking problem. Formulae of jal are interpreted directly by, and thus represent properties of, judgment aggregation rules. In Section 4 we demonstrate that the logic can express commonly discussed properties of judgment aggregation rules, such as the discursive paradox. We give a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic in Section 5, under the assumption that the agenda the agents make judgments over is finite. As mentioned above, preference aggregation can be seen as a special case of judgment aggregation, and in Section 6 we introduce an alternative interpretation of jal formulae directly in social welfare functions. We obtain a sound and complete axiomatisation of the logic for preference aggregation as well. Sections 7 and 8 discusses related work and concludes. 2. JUDGMENT AND PREFERENCE AGGREGATION Judgment aggregation is concerned with judgment aggregation rules aggregating sets of logical formulae; preference aggregation is concerned with social welfare functions aggregating preferences over some set of alternatives. Let n be a number of agents; we write Σ for the set {1, . . . , n}. 2.1 Judgment Aggregation Rules Let L be a logic with language L(L). We require that the language has negation and material implication, with the usual semantics. We will sometimes refer to L as the underlying logic. An agenda over L is a non-empty set A ⊆ L(L), where for every formula φ that does not start with a negation, φ ∈ A iff ¬φ ∈ A. We sometimes call a member of A an agenda item. A subset A ⊆ A is consistent unless A entails both ¬φ and φ in L for some φ ∈ L(L); A is complete if either φ ∈ A or ¬φ ∈ A for every φ ∈ A which does not start with negation. An (admissible) individual judgment set is a complete and consistent subset Ai ⊆ A of the agenda. The idea here is that a judgment set Ai represents the choices from A made by agent i. Two rationality criteria demand that an agents choices at least be internally consistent, and that each agent makes a decision between every item and its negation. An (admissible) judgment profile is an n-tuple A1, . . . , An , where Ai is the individual judgment set of agent i. J(A, L) denotes the set of all individual (complete and L-consistent) judgment sets over A, and J(A, L)n the set of all judgment profiles over A. When γ ∈ J(A, L)n , we use γi to denote the ith element of γ, i.e., agent is individual judgment set in judgment profile γ. A judgment aggregation rule (JAR) is a function f that maps each judgment profile A1, . . . , An to a complete and consistent collective judgment set f(A1, . . . , An) ∈ J(A, L). Such a rule hence is a recipe to enforce a rational group decision, given an tuple of rational choices by the individual agents. Of course, such a rule should to a certain extent be fair. Some possible properties of a judgment aggregation rule f over an agenda A: Non-dictatorship (ND1) There is no agent i such that for every judgment profile A1, . . . , An , f(A1, . . . , An) = Ai Independence (IND) For any p ∈ A and judgment profiles A1, . . . , An and B1, . . . , Bn , if for all agents i (p ∈ Ai iff p ∈ Bi), then p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An) iff p ∈ f(B1, . . . , Bn) Unanimity (UNA) For any judgment profile A1, . . . , An and any p ∈ A, if p ∈ Ai for all agents i, then p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An) 2.2 Social Welfare Functions Social welfare functions (SWFs) are usually defined in terms of ordinal preference structures, rather than cardinal structures such as utility functions. An SWF takes a preference relation, a binary relation over some set of alternatives, for each agent, and outputs another preference relation representing the aggregated preferences. The most well known result about SWFs is Arrows theorem [1]. Many variants of the theorem appear in the literature, differing in assumptions about the preference relations. In this paper, we take the assumption that all preference relations are linear orders, i.e., that neither agents nor the aggregated preference can be indifferent between distinct alternatives. This gives one of the simplest formulations of Arrows theorem (Theorem 1 below). Cf., e.g., [2] for a discussion and more general formulations. Formally, let K be a set of alternatives. We henceforth implicitly assume that there are always at least two alternatives. A preference relation (over K) is, here, a total (linear) order on K, i.e., a relation R over K which is antisymmetric (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R implies that a = b), transitive (i.e., (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R implies that (a, c) ∈ R), and total (i.e., either (a, b) ∈ R or (b, a) ∈ R). We sometimes use the infix notation aRb for (a, b) ∈ R. The set of preference relations over alternatives K is denoted L(K). Alternatively, we can view L(K) as the set of all permutations of K. Thus, we shall sometimes use a permutation of K to denote a member of L(K). For example, when K = {a, b, c}, we will sometimes use the expression acb to denote the relation {(a, c), (a, b), (c, b), (a, a), (b, b), (c, c)}. aRb means that b is preferred over a if a and b are different. Rs denotes the irreflexive version of R, i.e., Rs = R \\ {(a, a) : a ∈ K}. aRs b means that b is preferred over a and that a b. A preference profile for Σ over alternatives K is a tuple (R1, . . . , Rn) ∈ L(K)n , consisting of one preference relation Ri for each agent i. A social welfare function (SWF) is a function F : L(K)n → L(K) mapping each preference profile to an aggregated preference relation. The class of all SWFs over alternatives K is denoted F (K). Properties of SWFs F corresponding to the judgment aggregation rule properties discussed in Section 2.1 are: The Sixth Intl.

Theorem 1 (Arrow). If there are more than two alternatives, no SWF has all the properties PO, ND2 and IIA. 3. JUDGMENT AGGREGATION LOGIC: SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS The language of Judgment Aggregation Logic (jal) is parameterised by a set of agents Σ = {1, 2, . . . , n} (we will assume that there are at least two agents) and an agenda A. The following atomic propositions are used: Π = {i, σ, hp | p ∈ A, i ∈ Σ} The language L(Σ, A) of jal is defined by the following grammar: φ ::= α | φ | φ | φ ∧ φ | ¬φ where α ∈ Π. This language will be formally interpreted in structures consisting of an agenda item, a judgment profile and a judgment aggregation function; informally, i means that the agenda item is in agent is judgment set in the current judgment profile; σ means that the agenda item is in the aggregated judgment set of the current judgment profile; hp means that the agenda item is p; φ means that φ is true in every judgment profile; φ means that φ is true in every agenda item. We define ψ = ¬ ¬ψ, intuitively meaning ψ is true for some judgment profile, and ψ = ¬ ¬ψ, intuitively meaning ψ is true for some agenda item, as usual, in addition to the usual derived propositional connectives. We now define the formal semantics of L(Σ, A). A model wrt. L(Σ, A) and underlying logic L is a judgment aggregation rule f over A. Recall that J(A, L)n denotes the set of complete and Lconsistent judgment profiles over A. A table is a tuple T = f, γ, p such that f is a model, γ ∈ J(A, L)n and p ∈ A. A formula is interpreted on a table as follows. f, γ, p |=L hq ⇔ p = q f, γ, p |=L i ⇔ p ∈ γi f, γ, p |=L σ ⇔ p ∈ f(γ) f, γ, p |=L ψ ⇔ ∀γ ∈ J(A, L)n f, γ , p |=L ψ f, γ, p |=L ψ ⇔ ∀p ∈ A f, γ, p |=L ψ f, γ, p |=L φ ∧ ψ ⇔ f, γ, p |=L φ and f, γ, p |=L ψ f, γ, p |=L ¬φ ⇔ f, γ, p |=L φ So, e.g., we have that f, γ, p |=L i∈Σ i if everybody chooses p in γ. Example 1. A committee of three agents are voting on the following three propositions: the candidate is qualified (p), if the candidate is qualified he will get an offer (p → q), and the candidate will get an offer (q). One possible voting scenario is illustrated in the left part of Table 1. In the table, the results of proposition-wise majority voting, i.e., the JAR fmaj accepting a proposition iff it is accepted by a majority of the agents, are also p p → q q 1 yes yes yes 2 no yes yes 3 yes no no fmaj yes yes yes 1 mdc 2 mcd 3 cmd Fmaj mcd Table 1: Examples shown. This example can be modelled by taking the agenda to be A = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q} (recall that agendas are closed under single negation) and L to be propositional logic. The agents votes can be modelled by the following judgment profile: γ = γ1, γ2, γ3 , where γ1 = {p, p → q, q}, γ2 = {¬p, p → q, q}, γ3 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q}. We then have that: • fmaj, γ, p |=L 1 ∧ ¬2 ∧ 3 (agents 1 and 3 judges p to be true in the profile γ, while agent 2 does not) • fmaj, γ, p |=L σ (majority voting on p given the preference profile γ leads to acceptance of p) • fmaj, γ, p |=L (1 ∧ 2) (agents 1 and 2 agree on some agenda item, under the judgment profile γ. Note that this formula does not depend on which agenda item is on the table.) • fmaj, γ, p |=L ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1 ↔ 3)) (there is some judgment profile on which all agents agree on p. Note that this formula does not depend on which judgment profile is on the table.) • fmaj, γ, p |=L ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1 ↔ 3)) (there is some judgment profile on which all agents agree on all agenda items. Note that this formula does not depend on any of the elements on the table.) • fmaj, γ, p |=L σ ↔ G⊆{1,2,3},|G|≥2 i∈G i (the JAR fmaj implements majority voting) We write f |=L φ iff f, γ, p |=L φ for every γ over A and p ∈ A; |=L φ iff f |=L φ for all models f. Given a possible property of a JAR, such as, e.g., independence, we say that a formula expresses the property if the formula is true in an aggregation rule f iff f has the property. Note that when we are given a formula φ ∈ L(Σ, A), validity, i.e., |=L φ, is defined with respect to models of the particular language L(Σ, A) defined over the particular agenda A (and similar for validity with respect to a JAR, i.e., f |=L φ). The agenda, like the set of agents Σ, is given when we define the language, and is thus implicit in the interpretation of the language1 . Let an outcome o be a maximal conjunction of literals (¬)1, . . . , (¬)n. The set O is the set of all possible outcomes. Note that the decision of the society is not incorporated here: an outcome only collects votes of agents from Σ. 3.1 Model Checking Model checking is currently one of the most active areas of research with respect to reasoning in modal logics [4], and it is natural to investigate the complexity of this problem for judgment aggregation logic. Intuitively, the model checking problem for judgment aggregation logic is as follows: Given f, γ, p and formula φ of jal, is it the case that f, γ, p |= φ or not? 1 Likewise, in classical modal logic the language is parameterised with a set of primitive propositions, and validity is defined with respect to all models with valuations over that particular set. 568 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) While this problem is easy to understand mathematically, it presents some difficulties if we want to analyse it from a computational point of view. Specifically, the problem lies in the representation of the judgment aggregation rule, f. Recall that this function maps judgment profiles to complete and consistent judgment sets. A JAR must be defined for all judgment profiles over some agenda, i.e., it must produce an output for all these possible inputs. But how are we to represent such a rule? The simplest representation of a function f : X → Y is as the set of ordered pairs {(x, y) | x ∈ X & y = f(x)}. However, this is not a feasible representation for JARs, as there will be exponentially many judgment profiles in the size of the agenda, and so the representation would be unfeasibly large in practice. If we did assume this representation for JARs, then it is not hard to see that model checking for our logic would be decidable in polynomial time: the naive algorithm, derivable from semantics, serves this purpose. However, we emphasise that this result is of no practical significance, since it assumes an unreasonable representation for models - a representation that simply could not be used in practice for examples of anything other than trivial size. So, what is a more realistic representation for JARs? Let us say a representation Rf of a JAR f is reasonable if: (i) the size of Rf is polynomial in the size of the agenda; and (ii) there is a polynomial time algorithm A, which takes as input a representation Rf and a judgment profile γ, and produces as output f(γ). There are, of course, many such representations Rf for JARs f. Here, we will look at one very general one: where the JAR is represented as a polynomially bounded two-tape Turing machine Tf , which takes on its first tape a judgment profile, and writes on its second tape the resulting judgment set. The requirement that the Turing machine should be polynomially bounded roughly corresponds to the requirement that a JAR is reasonable to compute; if there is some JAR that cannot be represented by such a machine, then it is arguably of little value, since it could not be used in practice2 . With such a representation, we can investigate the complexity of our model checking problem. In modal logics, the usual source of complexity, over and above the classical logic connectives, is the modal operators. With respect to judgment aggregation logic, the operator quantifies over all judgment profiles, and hence over all consistent subsets of the agenda. It follows that this is a rather powerful operator: as we will see, it can be used as an np oracle [9, p.339]. In contrast, the operator quantifies over members of the agenda, and is hence much weaker, from a computational perspective (we can think of it as a conjunction over elements of the agenda). The power of the quantifier suggests that the complexity of model checking judgment aggregation logic over relatively succinct representations of JAR is going to be relatively high; we now prove that the complexity of model checking judgment aggregation logic is as hard as solving a polynomial number of np-hard problems [9, pp.424-429]. Theorem 2. The model checking problem for judgment aggregation logic, assuming the representation of JARs described above, is Δp 2-hard; it is np-hard even if the formula to be checked is of the form ψ, where ψ contains no further or operators. Proof. For Δp 2-hardness, we reduce snsat (sequentially nested 2 Of course, we have no general way of checking whether any given Turing machine is guaranteed to terminate in polynomial time; the problem is undecidable. As a consequence, we cannot always check whether a particular Turing machine representation of a JAR meets our requirements. However, this does not prevent specific JARs being so represented, with corresponding proofs that they terminate in polynomial time. satisfiability). An instance is given by a series of equations of the form z1 = ∃X1.φ1(X1) z2 = ∃X2.φ2(X2, z1) z3 = ∃X3.φ3(X3, z1, z2) . . . zk = ∃Xk.φk(Xk, z1, . . . , zk−1) where X1, . . . , Xk are disjoint sets of variables, and each φi(Y) is a propositional logic formula over the variables Y; the idea is we first check whether φ1(X1) is satisfiable, and if it is, we assign z1 the value true, otherwise assign it false; we then check whether φ2 is satisfiable under the assumption that z1 takes the value just derived, and so on. Thus the result of each equation depends on the value of the previous one. The goal is to determine whether zk is true. To reduce this problem to judgment aggregation logic model checking, we first fix the JAR: this rule simply copies whatever agent 1s judgment set is. (Clearly this can be implemented by a polynomially bounded Turing machine.) The agenda is assumed to contain the variables X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xk ∪ {z1, . . . , zk} and their negations. We fix the initial judgment profile γ to be X1 ∪· · ·∪Xk ∪{z1, . . . , zk}, and fix p = x1. Given a variable xi, define x∗ i to be (hxi ∧1). If φi is one of the formulae φ1, . . . , φk, define φ∗ i to be the formula obtained from φi by systematically substituting x∗ i for each variable xi and z∗ i similarly. Now, we define the function ξi for natural numbers i > 0 as: ξk = z∗ 1 ↔ (φ∗ 1) if i = 1 z∗ i ↔ (φ∗ i ∧i−1 j=1 ξj) otherwise. And we define the formula to be model checked as: φ∗ k ∧k−1 j=1 ξj It is now straightforward from construction that this formula is true under the interpretation iff zk is true in the snsat instance. The proof of the latter half of the theorem is immediate from the special case where k = 1. 3.2 Some Properties We have thus defined a language which can be used to express properties of judgment aggregation rules. An interesting question is then: what are the universal properties of aggregation rules expressible in the language; which formulae are valid? Here, in order to illustrate the logic, we discuss some of these logical properties. In Section 5 we give a complete axiomatisation of all of them. Recall that we defined the set O of outcomes as the set of all conjunctions with exactly one, possibly negated, atom from Σ. Let P = {o ∧ σ, o ∧ ¬σ : o ∈ O}; p ∈ P completely describes the decisions of the agents and the aggregation function. Let denote exclusive or. We have that: |=L p∈Pp - any agent and the JAR always have to make a decision |=L (i ∧ ¬j) → ¬i - if some agent can think differently about an item than i does, then also i can change his mind about it. In fact this principle can be strengthened to |=L ( i ∧ ¬j) → (¬i ∧ j) |=L x - for any x ∈ {i, ¬i, σ, ¬σ : i ∈ Σ} - both the individual agents and the JAR will always judge some agenda item to be true, and conversely, some agenda item to be false |=L (i ∧ j) - there exist admissible judgment sets such that agents i and j agree on some judgment. |=L (i ↔ j) - there exist admissible judgment sets such that agents i and j always agree. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 569 The interpretation of formulae depends on the agenda A and the underlying logic L, in the quantification over the set J(A, L)n of admissible, e.g., complete and L-consistent, judgment profiles. Note that this means that some jal formula might be valid under one underlying logic, while not under another. For example, if the agenda contains some formula which is inconsistent in the underlying logic (and, by implication, some tautology), then the following hold: |=L (i ∧ σ) - for every judgment profile, there is some agenda item (take a tautology) which both agent i and the JAR judges to be true But this property does not hold when every agenda item is consistent with respect to the underlying logic. One such agenda and underlying logic will be discussed in Section 6. 4. EXPRESSIVITY EXAMPLES Non-dictatorship can be expressed as follows: ND = i∈Σ ¬(σ ↔ i) (1) Lemma 1. f |=L ND iff f has the property ND1. Independence can be expressed as follows: IND = o∈O ((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2) Lemma 2. f |=L IND iff f has the property IND. Unanimity can be expressed as follows: UNA = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3) Lemma 3. f |=L UNA iff f has the property UNA. 4.1 The Discursive Paradox As illustrated in Example 1, the following formula expresses proposition-wise majority voting over some proposition p MV = σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i (4) i.e., the following property of a JAR f and admissible profile A1, . . . , An : p ∈ f(A1, . . . , An) ⇔ |{i : p ∈ Ai}| > |{i : p Ai}| f |= MV exactly iff f has the above property for all judgment profiles and propositions. However, we have the following in our logic. Assume that the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication (i.e., A contains p, q, p → q for some p, q ∈ L(L)). Proposition 1 (Discursive Paradox). |=L (( MV) → ⊥) when there are at least three agents and the agenda contains at least two distinct formulae and their material implication. Proof. Assume the opposite, e.g., that A = {p, p → q, q, ¬p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and there exists an aggregation rule f over A such that f |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i). Let γ be the judgment profile γ = A1, A2, A3 where A1 = {p, p → q, q, . . .}, A2 = {p, ¬(p → q), ¬q, . . .} and A3 = {¬p, p → q, ¬q, . . .}. We have that f, γ, p |=L (σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i) for any p , so f, γ, p |=L σ ↔ G⊆Σ,|G|> n 2 i∈G i. Because f, γ, p |=L 1 ∧ 2, it follows that f, γ, p |=L σ. In a similar manner it follows that f, γ, p → q |=L σ and f, γ, q |=L ¬σ. In other words, p ∈ f(γ), p → q ∈ f(γ) and q f(γ). Since f(γ) is complete, ¬q ∈ f(γ). But that contradicts the fact that f(γ) is required to be consistent. Proposition 1 is a logical statement of a variant of the well-known discursive dilemma: if three agents are voting on propositions p, q and p → q, proposition-wise majority voting might not yield a consistent result. 5. AXIOMATISATION Given an underlying logic L, a finite agenda A over L, and a set of agents Σ, Judgment Aggregation Logic (jal(L), or just jal when L is understood) for the language L(Σ, A), is defined in Table 2. ¬(hp ∧ hq) if p q Atmost p∈A hp Atleast hp p ∈ A Agenda (hp ∧ ϕ) → (hp → ϕ) Once (hp ∧ x) ∨ (hp ∧ x) CpJS all instantiations of propositional tautologies taut (ψ1 → ψ2) → ( ψ1 → ψ2) K ψ → ψ T ψ → ψ 4 ¬ ψ → ¬ ψ 5 ( i ∧ ¬j) → o∈O o C ψ ↔ ψ (COMM) From p1, . . . pn L q infer (hp1 ∧ x) ∧ · · · ∧ (hpn ∧ x) → (hq → x) ∧ (hq → ¬x) Closure From ϕ → ψ and ϕ infer ψ MP From ψ infer ψ Nec Table 2: The logic jal(L) for the language L(Σ, A). p, pi, q range over the agenda A; φ,ψ,ψi over L(Σ, A); x over {σ, i : i ∈ Σ}; over { , }; i, j over Σ; o over the set of outcomes O. hp means hq when p = ¬q for some q, otherwise it means h¬p. L is the underlying logic. The first 5 axioms represent properties of a table and of judgment sets. Axiom Atmost says that there is at most one item on the table at a time, and Atleast says that we always have an item on the table. Axiom Agenda says that every agenda item will appear on the table, whereas Once says that every item of the agenda only appears on the table once. Note that a conjunction hp ∧ x reads: item p is on the agenda, and x is in favour of it, or x judges it true. Axiom CpJS corresponds to the requirement that judgment sets are complete. Note that from Agenda, CsJS and CpJS we derive the scheme x ∧ ¬x, which says that everybody should at least express one opinion in favour of something, and against something. The axioms taut − 5 are well familiar from modal logic: they directly reflect the unrestricted quantification in the truth definition of and . Axiom C says that for any agenda item for which it is possible to have opposing opinions, every possible outcome for that item should be achievable. COMM says that everything that is true for an arbitrary profile and item, is also true for an arbitrary item and profile. Closure guarantees that agents behave consistently with respect to consequence in the logic L. MP and Nec are standard. We use JAL(L) to denote derivability in jal(L). Theorem 3. If the agenda is finite, we have that for any formula ψ ∈ L(Σ, A), JAL(L) ψ iff |=L ψ. Proof. Soundness is straightforward. For completeness (we focus on the main idea here and leave out trivial details), we build a 570 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) jal table for a consistent formula ψ as follows. In fact, our axiomatisation completely determines a table, except for the behaviour of f. To be more precise, let a table description be a conjunction of the form hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. It is easy to see that table descriptions are mutually exclusive, and, moreover, we can derive τ∈T τ, where T is the set of all table descriptions. Let D be the set of all maximal consistent sets Δ. We dont want all of those: it might well be that ψ requires σ to be in a certain way, which is incompatible with some Δs. We define two accessibility relations in the standard way: R Δ1Δ2 iff for all ψ: ψ ∈ Δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ Δ2. Similarly for R with respect to . Both relations are equivalences (due to taut-5), and moreover, when R Δ1Δ2 and R Δ2Δ3 then for some Δ2, also R Δ1Δ2 and R Δ2Δ3 (because of axiom COMM). Let Δ0 be a MCS containing ψ. We now define the set Tables = {Δ0} ∪ {Δ1, Δ2 | (R Δ0Δ1 and R Δ1Δ2) or (R Δ0Δ1 and R Δ1Δ2)} Every Δ ∈ Tables can be conceived as a pair γ, p, since every Δ contains a unique (hq ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ) for every hq and a unique hp. It is then easy to verify that, for every Δ ∈ Tables, and every formula ϕ, Δ |= ϕ iff ϕ ∈ Δ, where |= here means truth in the ordinary modal logic sense when the set of states is taken to be Tables. Now, we extract an aggregation function f and pairs γ, p as follows: For every Δ ∈ Tables, find a conjunction hp ∧ o ∧ (¬)σ. There will be exactly one such p. This defines the p we are looking for. Furthermore, the γ is obtained, for every agent i, by finding all q for which (hq ∧ i) is currently true. Finally, the function f is a table of all tuples hp, o(p), σ for which (hp ∧ o(o) ∧ σ) is contained in some set in Tables. We point out that jal has all the axioms taut, K, T, 4, 5 and the rules MP and Nec of the modal logic S5. However, uniform substitution, a principle of all normal modal logics (cf., e.g., [3]), does not hold. A counter example is the fact that the following is valid: σ (5) - no matter what preferences the agents have, the JAR will always make some judgment - while this is not valid: (σ ∧ i) (6) - the JAR will not necessarily make the same judgments as agent i. So, for example, we have that the discursive paradox is provable in jal(L): JAL(L) (( MV) → ⊥). An example of a derivation of the less complicated (valid) property (i ∧ j) is shown in Table 3. 6. PREFERENCE AGGREGATION Recently, Dietrich and List [5] showed that preference aggregation can be embedded in judgment aggregation. In this section we show that our judgment aggregation logic also can be used to reason about preference aggregation. Given a set K of alternatives, [5] defines a simple predicate logic LK with language L(LK ) as follows: • L(LK ) has one constant a for each alternative a ∈ K, variables v1, v2, . . ., a binary identity predicate =, a binary predicate P for strict preference, and the usual propositional and first order connectives • Z is the collection of the following axioms: - ∀v1 ∀v2 (v1Pv2 → ¬v2Pv1) - ∀v1 ∀v2 ∀v3 ((v1Pv2 ∧ v2Pv3) → v1Pv3) - ∀v1 ∀v2 (¬v1 = v2 → (v1Pv2 ∨ v2Pv1)) • When Γ ⊆ L(LK ) and φ is a formula, Γ |= φ is defined to hold iff Γ ∪ Z entails φ in the standard sense of predicate logic 1 (hp ∧ i) ∨ (hp ∧ i) CpJS(i) 2 (hp ∧ j) ∨ (hp ∧ j) CpJS(j) 3 Call 1 A ∨ B and 2 C ∨ D abbreviation, 1, 2 4 (A ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ D) ∨ (B ∧ C) ∨ (B ∧ D) taut, 3 5 derive (i ∧ j) from every disjunct of 4 strategy is ∨ elim 6 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume A ∧ C 7 (hp → (i ∧ j)) Once, 6, K( ) 8 (i ∧ j) 7, Agenda 9 (i ∧ j) 8, T( ) 10 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume A ∧ D 11 (hp ∧ x) ↔ (hp ∧ ¬x) Agenda, Closure 12 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ ¬j) 10, 11 13 (hp ∧ i ∧ ¬j) 12, Once, K( ) 14 (i ∧ ¬j) 13, taut 15 (i ∧ ¬j) 14, K( ) 16 (i ∧ ¬j) 15, COMM 17 ( i ∧ D¬j) 16, K( ) 18 (i ∧ j) 17, C 19 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume B ∧ D 20 goes as 6-9 21 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume B ∧ C 22 goes as 10 - 18 23 (i ∧ j) ∨-elim, 1, 2, 9, 18, 20, 22 Table 3: jar derivation of (i ∧ j) It is easy to see that there is an one-to-one correspondence between the set of preference relations (total linear orders) over K and the set of LK -consistent and complete judgment sets over the preference agenda AK = {aPb, ¬aPb : a, b ∈ K, a b} Given a SWF F over K, the corresponding JAR fF over the preference agenda AK is defined as follows fF (A1, . . . , An) = A, where A is the consistent and complete judgment set corresponding to F(L1, . . . , Ln) where Li is the preference relation corresponding to the consistent and complete judgment set Ai. Thus we can use jal to reason about preference aggregation as follows. Take the logical language L(Σ, AK ), for some set of agents Σ, and take the underlying logic to be LK . We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K, a preference profile L ∈ L(K) and a pair (a, b) ⊆ K × K, a b, as follows: F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ ⇔ fF , γL , aPb |=LK φ where γL is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile L. While in the general judgment aggregation case a formula is interpreted in the context of an agenda item, in the preference aggregation case a formula is thus interpreted in the context of a pair of alternatives. Example 2. Three agents must decide between going to dinner (d), a movie (m) or a concert (c). Their individual preferences are illustrated on the right in Table 1 in Section 3, along with the result of a SWF Fmaj implementing pair-wise majority voting. Let L = mdc, mcd, cmd be the preference profile corresponding to the preferences in the example. We have the following: • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf 1 ∧ 2 ∧ 3 (all agents agree, under the individual rankings L, on the relative ranking of m and dthey agree that d is better than m) • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf ¬(1 ↔ 2) (under the individual rankings L, there is some pair of alternatives on which agents 1 and 2 disagree) The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 571 • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf (1 ∧ 2) (agents 1 and 2 can choose their preferences such that they will agree on some pair of alternatives) • Fmaj, L, (m, d) |=swf σ ↔ G⊆{1,2,3},|G|≥2 i∈G i (the SWF Fmaj implements pair-wise majority voting) As usual, we write F |=swf φ when F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ for any L and (a, b), and so on. Thus, our formulae can be seen as expressing properties of social welfare functions. Example 3. Take the formula (i ↔ σ). When this formula is interpreted as a statement about a social welfare function, it says that there exists a preference profile such that for all pairs (a, b) of alternatives, b is preferred over a in the aggregation (by the SWF) of the preference profile if and only if agent i prefers b over a. 6.1 Expressivity Examples We make precise the claim in Section 2.2 that the three mentioned SWF properties correspond to the three mentioned JAR properties, respectively. Recall the formulae defined in Section 4. Proposition 2. F |=swf ND iff F has the property ND2 F |=swf IND iff F has the property IIA F |=swf UNA iff F has the property PO The properties expressed above are properties of SWFs. Let us now look at properties of the set of alternatives K we can express. Properties involving cardinality is often of interest, for example in Arrows theorem. Let: MT2 = ( (1 ∧ 2) ∧ (1 ∧ ¬2)) Proposition 3. Let F ∈ F (K). |K| > 2 iff F |=swf MT2. Proof. For the direction to the left, let F |=swf MT2. Thus, there is a γ such that there exists (a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ) ∈ K × K, where a1 b1 , and a2 b2 , such that (i) a1 Pb1 ∈ γ1, (ii) a1 Pb1 ∈ γ2, (iii) a2 Pb2 ∈ γ1 and (iv) a2 Pb2 γ2. From (ii) and (iv) we get that (a1 , b1 ) (a2 , b2 ), and from that and (i) and (iii) it follows that γ1 contains two different pairs a1 Pb1 and a2 Pb2 each having two different elements. But that is not possible if |K| = 2, because if K = {a, b} then AK = {aPb, ¬aPb, bPa, ¬bPa} and thus it is impossible that γ1 ⊆ AK since we cannot have aPb, bPa ∈ γ1. For the direction to the right, let |K| > 2; let a, b, c be three distinct elements of K. Let γ1 be the judgment set corresponding to the ranking abc and γ2 the judgment set corresponding to acb. Now, for any aggregation rule f, f, γ, aPb |= 1 ∧ 2 and f, γ, bPc |= 1 ∧ ¬2. Thus, F |=swf MT2, for any SWF F. We now have everything we need to express Arrows statement as a formula. It follows from his theorem that the formula is valid on the class of all social welfare functions. Theorem 4. |=swf MT2 → ¬(PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA) Proof. Note that MT2, PO, ND and IIA are true SWF properties, their truth value wrt. a table is determined solely by the SWF. For example, F, L, (a, b) |=swf MT2 iff F |= MT2, for any F, L, a, b. Let F ∈ F (K), and F, L, (a, b) |=swf MT2 for some L and a, b. By Proposition 3, K has more than two alternatives. By Arrows theorem, F cannot have all the properties PO, ND2 and IIA. W.l.o.g assume that F does not have the PO property. By Proposition 2, F |=swf PO. Since PO is a SWF property, this means that F, L, (a, b) |=swf PO (satisfaction of PO is independent of L, a, b), and thus that F, L, (a, b) |=swf ¬PO ∨ ¬ND ∨ ¬IIA. Note that the formula in Theorem 4 does not mention any agenda items (i.e., pairs of alternatives) such as haPb directly in an expression. This means that the formula is a member of L(Σ, AK ) for any set of alternatives K, and is valid no matter which set of alternatives we assume. The formula MV which in the general judgment aggregation case expresses proposition-wise majority voting, expresses in the preference aggregation case pair-wise majority voting, as illustrated in Example 2. The preference aggregation correspondent to the discursive paradox of judgment aggregation is the well known Condorcets voting paradox, stating that pair-wise majority voting can lead to aggregated preferences which are cyclic (even if the individual preferences are not). We can express Condorcets paradox as follows, again as a universally valid logical property of SWFs. Proposition 4. |=swf MT2 → ¬MV, when there are at least three agents. Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the discursive paradox. Let fF , γ, aPb |=LK MT2; there are thus three distinct elements a, b, c ∈ K. Assume that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV. Let γ be the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile X = (abc, cab, bca). We have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK 1 ∧ 2 and, since fF , γ , aPb |=LK MV, we have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK σ and thus that aPb ∈ fF (γ ) and (a, b) ∈ F(X). In a similar manner we get that (c, a) ∈ F(X) and (b, c) ∈ F(X). But that is impossible, since by transitivity we would also have that (a, c) ∈ F(X) which contradicts the fact that F(X) is antisymmetric. Thus, it follows that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV. 6.2 Axiomatisation and Logical Properties We immediately get, from Theorem 3, a sound and complete axiomatisation of preference aggregation over a finite set of alternatives. Corollary 1. If the set of alternatives K is finite, we have that for any formula ψ ∈ L(Σ, AK ), JAL(LK ) ψ iff |=swf ψ. Proof. Follows immediately from Theorem 3 and the fact that for any JAR f, there is a SWF F such that f = fF . So, for example, Arrows theorem is provable in jal(LK ): JAL(LK ) MT2 → ¬(PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA). Every formula which is valid with respect to judgment aggregation rules is also valid with respect to social welfare functions, so all general logical properties of JARs are also properties of SWFs. Depending on the agenda, SWFs may have additional properties, induced by the logic LK , which are not always shared by JARs with other underlying logics. One such property is i. While we have |=swf i, for other agendas there are underlying logics L such that |=L i To see the latter, take an agenda with a formula p which is inconsistent in the underlying logic L - p can never be included in a judgment set. To see the former, take an arbitrary pair of alternatives (a, b). There exists some preference profile in which agent i prefers b over a. Technically speaking, the formula i holds in SWFs because the agenda AK does not contain a formula which (alone) is inconsistent wrt. the underlying logic LK . By the same reason, the following properties also hold in SWFs but not in JARs in general. |=swf o∈O o 572 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) - for any pair of alternatives (a, b), any possible combination of the relative ranking of a and b among the agents is possible. |=swf i → ¬i - given an alternative b which is preferred over some other alternative a by agent i, there is some other pair of alternatives c and d such that d is not preferred over c - namely (c, d) = (b, a). |=swf ( (i ∨ j) → (i ∧ ¬j)) - if, given preferences of agents and a SWF, for any two alternatives it is always the case that either agent i or agent j prefers the second alternative over the first, then there must exist a pair of alternatives for which the two agents disagree. A justification is that no single agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair of alternatives, so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer a over b. Again, this property does not necessarily hold for other agendas, because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the agents could not possibly disagree upon. Proof theoretically, these additional properties of SWFs are derived using the Closure rule. 7. RELATED WORK Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8]. A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different judgment aggregation rules. While the motivation is similar to the work in this paper, the approaches are fundamentally different: in [10], the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically; in our approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs, i.e., judgment profiles, are taken as primary and described axiomatically. The two approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the sense that one can be embedded in the other. The modal logic arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows. In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows. Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic. However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper. Nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investigated further in future work. In particular, arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt. an algebra. This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and collective preferences. Then, changing the preference profile takes us from one algebra to another, and a SWF determines the collective preference, in each of the algebras. 8. DISCUSSION We have presented a sound and complete logic jal for representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation. jal is expressive: it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting; complicated properties such as independence; and important results such as the discursive paradox, Arrows theorem and Condorcets paradox. We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about judgment aggregation. It is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities. jal provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 . The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian preference aggregation. Thus our framework sheds light on the differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other. In future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets, and try to characterise these in the logical language, as properties of general judgment sets, instead. 9.

Introducción En este documento, estamos interesados en formalismos de representación del conocimiento para sistemas en los que los agentes necesitan agregar sus preferencias, juicios, creencias, etc. Por ejemplo, un agente puede necesitar razonar sobre la votación mayoritaria en un grupo del que es miembro. La agregación de preferencias: combinando las relaciones de preferencia de los individuos sobre algún conjunto de alternativas en una relación de preferencia que representa las preferencias conjuntas del grupo por las llamadas funciones de bienestar social, se ha estudiado ampliamente en la teoría de la elección social [2]. El campo recientemente emergente de la agregación de juicio estudia la agregación desde una perspectiva lógica, y analiza cómo, dado un conjunto consistente de fórmulas lógicas para cada agente, que representa las creencias o juicios de los agentes, podemos agregarlas a un solo conjunto consistente de fórmulas. Una variedad de reglas de agregación de juicio se han desarrollado para este fin. Como caso especial, se puede ver que la agregación de juicio subsume la agregación de preferencias [5]. En este artículo presentamos una lógica, llamada Lógica de agregación de juicio (JAL), para razonar sobre la agregación del juicio. Las fórmulas de la lógica se interpretan como declaraciones sobre las reglas de agregación del juicio, y damos una axiomatización sólida y completa de todas esas reglas. La axiomatización se parametriza de tal manera que podamos instanciarla para obtener una variedad de lógicas de agregación de juicio diferentes. Por ejemplo, una instancia es una axiomatización, en nuestro idioma, de todas las funciones de bienestar social, por lo tanto, también obtenemos una lógica de la agregación de preferencias clásicas. Y esta es una de las principales contribuciones de este documento: identificamos las propiedades lógicas de la agregación del juicio, y podemos comparar las propiedades lógicas de las diferentes clases de agregación del juicio, y de la agregación general del juicio y la agregación de preferencias en particular. Por supuesto, una lógica solo es interesante siempre que sea expresiva. Uno de los objetivos de este documento es investigar las capacidades representativas y lógicas que un agente necesita para la agregación de juicio y preferencia;Es decir, ¿qué tipo de lenguaje lógico podría usarse para representar y razonar sobre la agregación del juicio? El lenguaje de representación del conocimiento de los agentes debería poder expresar: reglas de agregación comunes, como la votación mayoritaria;Las propiedades comúnmente discutidas de las reglas de agregación de juicio y las funciones de bienestar social, como la independencia;Paradojas comúnmente utilizadas para ilustrar la agregación del juicio y la agregación de preferencias, a saber.la paradoja discursiva y la paradoja de los condorcetos respectivamente;y otras propiedades importantes, como el teorema de flechas. Para ilustrar con más detalle lo que tal lenguaje necesitaría ser capaz de expresar, tome el ejemplo de una propiedad potencial de las funciones de bienestar social (SWFS) llamadas independencia de alternativas irrelevantes (IIA): dados dos perfiles de preferencia (cada uno que consiste enUna relación de preferencia para cada agente) y dos alternativas, si para cada agente las dos alternativas tienen el mismo orden en los dos perfiles de preferencia, entonces las dos alternativas deben tener el mismo orden en las dos relaciones de preferencia resultantes de aplicar el SWF a los dosPerfiles de preferencias, respectivamente. A partir de este ejemplo, parece que un lenguaje formal para SWFS debería poder expresar: 566 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas • Cuantificación en varios niveles: sobre alternativas;sobre perfiles de preferencia, es decir, sobre las relaciones sobre alternativas (cuantificación de segundo orden);y sobre agentes.• Propiedades de las relaciones de preferencia para diferentes agentes, y propiedades de varias relaciones de preferencia diferentes para el mismo agente en la misma fórmula.• Comparación de diferentes relaciones de preferencia.• La relación de preferencia resultante de aplicar un SWF a otras relaciones de preferencia. Desde estos puntos, puede parecer que dicho lenguaje sería bastante complejo (en particular, estos requisitos parecen descartar una lógica modal proposicional estándar). Quizás sorprendentemente, el lenguaje de Jal es sintáctica y semánticamente bastante simple;Y, sin embargo, el lenguaje es, sin embargo, lo suficientemente expresivo como para dar expresiones elegantes y sucintas de, por ejemplo, IIA, la mayoría de votación, el dilema discursivo, la paradoja de los condorcetos y el teorema de flechas. Esto significa, por ejemplo, que el teorema de las flechas es un teorema formal de Jal, es decir, una fórmula derivable;Por lo tanto, tenemos una teoría de prueba formal para la elección social. La estructura del resto del papel es la siguiente. En la siguiente sección revisamos los conceptos básicos de la agregación del juicio, así como la agregación de preferencias, y mencionamos algunas propiedades comúnmente discutidas de las reglas de agregación de juicio y las funciones de bienestar social. En la Sección 3 presentamos la sintaxis y la semántica de JAL, y estudiamos la complejidad del problema de verificación del modelo. Las fórmulas de Jal se interpretan directamente por y, por lo tanto, representan propiedades de las reglas de agregación de juicio. En la Sección 4 demostramos que la lógica puede expresar propiedades comúnmente discutidas de las reglas de agregación del juicio, como la paradoja discursiva. Damos una axiomatización sólida y completa de la lógica en la Sección 5, bajo el supuesto de que la agenda que los agentes emiten juicios es finita. Como se mencionó anteriormente, la agregación de preferencias puede verse como un caso especial de agregación de juicio, y en la Sección 6 presentamos una interpretación alternativa de las fórmulas JAL directamente en las funciones de bienestar social. Obtenemos una axiomatización sólida y completa de la lógica para la agregación de preferencias también. Las secciones 7 y 8 analizan el trabajo relacionado y concluyen.2. La agregación de juicio de juicio y preferencia se refiere a las reglas de agregación de juicio que agregan conjuntos de fórmulas lógicas;La agregación de preferencias se refiere a las funciones de bienestar social que agregan preferencias sobre algún conjunto de alternativas. Sea n varios agentes;Escribimos σ para el conjunto {1 ,..., n}.2.1 Reglas de agregación de juicio Sea L una lógica con el lenguaje L (l). Requerimos que el lenguaje tenga negación y implicación material, con la semántica habitual. A veces nos referiremos a L como la lógica subyacente. Una agenda sobre L es un conjunto no vacío A ⊆ L (L), donde para cada fórmula φ que no comienza con una negación, φ ∈ A Iff ¬φ ∈ A. A veces llamamos a un miembro de un artículo de agenda. Un subconjunto a ⊆ a es consistente a menos que A implique tanto ¬nos como φ en L para algunos φ ∈ L (l);A está completo si φ ∈ A o ¬φ ∈ A para cada φ ∈ A que no comienza con la negación. Un conjunto de juicio individual (admisible) es un subconjunto completo y consistente ai ⊆ A de la agenda. La idea aquí es que un juicio establecido AI representa las opciones de un agente realizado por. Dos criterios de racionalidad exigen que las elecciones de los agentes al menos sean internamente consistentes, y que cada agente tome una decisión entre cada ítem y su negación. Un perfil de juicio (admisible) es un N-Tuple A1 ,..., An, donde AI es el conjunto de juicio individual del agente i.J (A, L) denota el conjunto de todos los conjuntos individuales (completos y consistentes) sobre A, y J (A, L) n el conjunto de todos los perfiles de juicio sobre A. Cuando γ ∈ J (a, l) n, usamos γi para denotar el elemento ésimo de γ, es decir, el agente es un juicio individual establecido en el perfil de juicio γ. Una regla de agregación de juicio (JAR) es una función F que mapea cada perfil de juicio A1 ,..., Y a un juicio colectivo completo y consistente establecido f (a1, ..., an) ∈ J (a, l). Tal regla, por lo tanto, es una receta para hacer cumplir una decisión grupal racional, dada una tupla de elecciones racionales de los agentes individuales. Por supuesto, dicha regla debería ser justa en cierta medida. Algunas propiedades posibles de una regla de agregación de juicio F sobre una agenda A: no dictadura (ND1) No hay agente I tal que para cada perfil de juicio A1 ,..., An, f (a1, ..., an) = ai independencia (ind) para cualquier p ∈ A y perfiles de juicio a1 ,..., AN y B1 ,..., Bn, si para todos los agentes i (p ∈ Ai iff p ∈ Bi), entonces p ∈ F (a1, ..., an) iff p ∈ F (b1, ..., bn) unanimidad (un) para cualquieraPerfil de juicio A1 ,..., Y cualquier p ∈ A, si p ∈ Ai para todos los agentes i, entonces p ∈ F (a1, ..., AN) 2.2 Funciones de bienestar social Las funciones de bienestar social (SWFS) generalmente se definen en términos de estructuras de preferencias ordinales,en lugar de estructuras cardinales, como funciones de utilidad. Un SWF toma una relación de preferencia, una relación binaria sobre algún conjunto de alternativas, para cada agente, y genera otra relación de preferencia que representa las preferencias agregadas. El resultado más conocido de SWFS es el teorema de flechas [1]. Muchas variantes del teorema aparecen en la literatura, que difieren en suposiciones sobre las relaciones de preferencia. En este documento, supuse que todas las relaciones de preferencia son órdenes lineales, es decir, que ni los agentes ni la preferencia agregada pueden ser indiferentes entre alternativas distintas. Esto proporciona una de las formulaciones más simples del teorema de flechas (Teorema 1 a continuación). Cf., por ejemplo, [2] para una discusión y formulaciones más generales. Formalmente, sea K un conjunto de alternativas. En adelante, suponemos implícitamente que siempre hay al menos dos alternativas. Una relación de preferencia (sobre k) es, aquí, un orden total (lineal) en k, es decir, una relación r sobre k que es antisimétrica (es decir, (a, b) ∈ R y (b, a) ∈ R implica quea = b), transitivo (es decir, (a, b) ∈ R y (b, c) ∈ R implica que (a, c) ∈ R) y total (es decir, (a, b) ∈ R o (b, a) ∈ R). A veces usamos el ARB de notación infijo para (a, b) ∈ R. El conjunto de relaciones de preferencia sobre las alternativas k se denota l (k). Alternativamente, podemos ver L (k) como el conjunto de todas las permutaciones de K. Por lo tanto, a veces usaremos una permutación de k para denotar un miembro de L (k). Por ejemplo, cuando k = {a, b, c}, a veces usaremos la expresión acb para denotar la relación {(a, c), (a, b), (c, b), (a, a)(b, b), (c, c)}.ARB significa que se prefiere B sobre A si A y B son diferentes. RS denota la versión irreflexiva de R, es decir, rs = r \\ {(a, a): a ∈ K}.ARS B significa que B se prefiere sobre A y que A B. Un perfil de preferencia para σ sobre las alternativas k es una tupla (R1, ..., rn) ∈ L (k) n, que consiste en una relación de preferencia Ri para cada agente i. Una función de bienestar social (SWF) es una función F: L (k) n → L (k) mapeo de cada perfil de preferencia a una relación de preferencia agregada. La clase de todos los SWF sobre alternativas k se denota f (k). Las propiedades de SWFS F correspondientes a la regla de agregación del juicio Las propiedades discutidas en la Sección 2.1 son: El Sexto INTL.

Lógica de agregación de juicio: Sintaxis y semántica El lenguaje de la lógica de agregación del juicio (JAL) es parametrizado por un conjunto de agentes σ = {1, 2 ,..., n} (asumiremos que hay al menos dos agentes) y una agenda A. Se usan las siguientes proposiciones atómicas: π = {i, σ, hp |p ∈ A, I ∈ σ} El lenguaje l (σ, a) de Jal se define por la siguiente gramática: φ :: = α |φ |φ |φ ∧ φ |¬φ donde α ∈ π. Este lenguaje se interpretará formalmente en estructuras que consisten en un elemento de la agenda, un perfil de juicio y una función de agregación de juicio;Informalmente, me refiero a que el elemento de la agenda está en el agente está establecido en el perfil de juicio actual;σ significa que el elemento de la agenda está en el conjunto de juicio agregado del perfil de juicio actual;HP significa que el elemento de la agenda es P;φ significa que φ es cierto en cada perfil de juicio;φ significa que φ es cierto en cada elemento de la agenda. Definimos ψ = ¬ ¬ψ, intuitivamente un significado ψ es cierto para algún perfil de juicio, y ψ = ¬ ψ, intuitivamente un significado ψ es cierto para algún elemento de agenda, como de costumbre, además de las conectivas proposicionales derivadas habituales. Ahora definimos la semántica formal de L (σ, a). Un modelo WRT. L (σ, a) y la lógica subyacente L es una regla de agregación de juicio F sobre A. Recuerde que J (A, L) n denota el conjunto de perfiles de juicio completos y lconsistentes sobre A. Una tabla es una tupla t = f, γ, p tal que F es un modelo, γ ∈ J (a, l) n y p ∈ A. Una fórmula se interpreta en una tabla de la siguiente manera.F, γ, P | = L HQ ⇔ P = Q F, γ, P | = L I ⇔ P ∈ γi F, γ, P | = L σ ⇔ P ∈ F (γ) F, γ, P | = L ψ⇔ ∀γ ∈ J (A, L) N F, γ, P | = L ψ F, γ, P | = L ψ ⇔ ∀p ∈ A F, γ, P | = L ψ F, γ, P | = Lφ ∧ ψ ⇔ F, γ, P | = L φ y F, γ, P | = L ψ F, γ, P | = L ¬φ ⇔ F, γ, P | = L φ So, por ejemplo, tenemos que esoF, γ, p | = l i∈σ I Si todos eligen P en γ. Ejemplo 1. Un comité de tres agentes está votando sobre las siguientes tres propuestas: el candidato está calificado (P), si el candidato está calificado, obtendrá una oferta (P → Q), y el candidato recibirá una oferta (Q). Un posible escenario de votación se ilustra en la parte izquierda de la Tabla 1. En la tabla, los resultados de la votación de la mayoría en cuanto a la proposición, es decir, el jar fmaj aceptando una proposición si es aceptada por la mayoría de los agentes, también son p p p p → q q 1 sí sí sí 2 no sí sí 3 sí no fmajSí sí Sí 1 MDC 2 MCD 3 CMD FMAJ MCD Tabla 1: Se muestran ejemplos. Este ejemplo puede modelarse tomando la agenda para que sea A = {P, P → Q, Q, ¬P, ¬ (P → Q), ¬q} (recuerde que las agendas están cerradas bajo negación única) y L es proposicionallógica. Los votos de los agentes se pueden modelar mediante el siguiente perfil de juicio: γ = γ1, γ2, γ3, donde γ1 = {p, p → q, q}, γ2 = {¬P, p → q, q}, γ3 = {p, ¬ (P → Q), ¬Q}. Luego tenemos eso: • fmaj, γ, p | = l 1 ∧ ¬2 ∧ 3 (agentes 1 y 3 jueces P para ser verdaderos en el perfil γ, mientras que el agente 2 no) • fmaj, γ, p | = lσ (Votación mayoritaria en P Dado el perfil de preferencia γ conduce a la aceptación de P) • FMAJ, γ, P | = L (1 ∧ 2) (los agentes 1 y 2 acuerdan algún elemento de la agenda, bajo el perfil de juicio γ. Tenga en cuenta que esta fórmula no depende de qué elemento de la agenda esté en la tabla.) • FMAJ, γ, P | = L ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1 ↔ 3)) (Hay algún juicioPerfil en el que todos los agentes están de acuerdo en p. Tenga en cuenta que esta fórmula no depende de qué perfil del juicio está en la tabla). • FMAJ, γ, P | = L ((1 ↔ 2) ∧ (2 ↔ 3) ∧ (1↔ 3)) (Hay algún perfil de juicio sobre el cual todos los agentes acuerdan todos los elementos de la agenda. Tenga en cuenta que esta fórmula no depende de ninguno de los elementos de la tabla.) • FMAJ, γ, P | = L σ ↔ G⊆ {1,2,3}, | G | ≥2 i∈G I (el jarFMAJ implementa el voto mayoritario) Escribimos f | = l φ iff f, γ, p | = l φ para cada γ sobre a y p ∈ A;| = L φ iff f | = l φ para todos los modelos f.Dada una posible propiedad de un frasco, como, por ejemplo, la independencia, decimos que una fórmula expresa la propiedad si la fórmula es verdadera en una regla de agregación f iff f tiene la propiedad. Tenga en cuenta que cuando se nos da una fórmula φ ∈ L (σ, a), validez, es decir, | = l φ, se define con respecto a los modelos del lenguaje particular l (σ, a) definido sobre la agenda particular A (ysimilar para la validez con respecto a un frasco, es decir, f | = l φ). La agenda, como el conjunto de agentes σ, se da cuando definimos el lenguaje y, por lo tanto, está implícito en la interpretación del lenguaje1. Deje que un resultado sea una conjunción máxima de literales (¬) 1 ,..., (¬) n.El conjunto O es el conjunto de todos los resultados posibles. Tenga en cuenta que la decisión de la sociedad no se incorpora aquí: un resultado solo recopila votos de agentes de σ.3.1 Comprobación del modelo La verificación del modelo es actualmente una de las áreas de investigación más activas con respecto al razonamiento en lógicas modales [4], y es natural investigar la complejidad de este problema para la lógica de agregación de juicio. Intuitivamente, el problema de verificación del modelo para la lógica de agregación del juicio es la siguiente: Dado F, γ, P y Fórmula φ de Jal, ¿es el caso que F, γ, P | = φ o no?1 Del mismo modo, en la lógica modal clásica, el lenguaje se parametriza con un conjunto de proposiciones primitivas, y la validez se define con respecto a todos los modelos con valoraciones sobre ese conjunto en particular.568 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Si bien este problema es fácil de entender matemáticamente, presenta algunas dificultades si queremos analizarlo desde un punto de vista computacional. Específicamente, el problema radica en la representación de la regla de agregación del juicio, f.Recuerde que esta función mapea los perfiles de juicio para conjuntos de juicio completos y consistentes. Se debe definir un frasco para todos los perfiles de juicio en alguna agenda, es decir, debe producir una salida para todas estas entradas posibles. Pero, ¿cómo debemos representar tal regla? La representación más simple de una función f: x → y es como el conjunto de pares ordenados {(x, y) |x ∈ X & y = f (x)}. Sin embargo, esta no es una representación factible para los frascos, ya que habrá exponencialmente muchos perfiles de juicio en el tamaño de la agenda, por lo que la representación sería inviable en la práctica. Si asumimos esta representación para frascos, entonces no es difícil ver que la verificación del modelo para nuestra lógica sería decidible en el tiempo polinomial: el algoritmo ingenuo, derivable de la semántica, tiene este propósito. Sin embargo, enfatizamos que este resultado no tiene importancia práctica, ya que asume una representación irrazonable para los modelos, una representación que simplemente no podría usarse en la práctica para ejemplos de otra cosa que no sea el tamaño trivial. Entonces, ¿qué es una representación más realista para los frascos? Digamos que una representación RF de un jar f es razonable si: (i) el tamaño de RF es polinomial en el tamaño de la agenda;y (ii) hay un algoritmo de tiempo polinómico A, que toma como entrada una representación de RF y un perfil de juicio γ, y produce como salida F (γ). Hay, por supuesto, muchas de esas representaciones RF para frascos f.Aquí, veremos uno muy general: donde el frasco se representa como una máquina Turing Machine Turing de Turing Polinomialmente limitada, que adquiere su primera cinta un perfil de juicio, y escribe en su segunda cinta el conjunto de juicio resultante. El requisito de que la máquina Turing debe estar limitada polinomialmente corresponde al requisito de que un frasco sea razonable para calcular;Si hay algún frasco que no puede ser representado por dicha máquina, entonces podría decirse que es poco valor, ya que no podría usarse en la práctica2. Con tal representación, podemos investigar la complejidad de nuestro problema de verificación de modelos. En lógicas modales, la fuente habitual de complejidad, más allá de los conectivos lógicos clásicos, son los operadores modales. Con respecto a la lógica de agregación de juicio, el operador cuantifica sobre todos los perfiles de juicio y, por lo tanto, sobre todos los subconjuntos consistentes de la agenda. Se deduce que este es un operador bastante poderoso: como veremos, puede usarse como un oráculo NP [9, p.339]. En contraste, el operador cuantifica sobre los miembros de la agenda y, por lo tanto, es mucho más débil, desde una perspectiva computacional (podemos pensar que es una conjunción sobre los elementos de la agenda). El poder del cuantificador sugiere que la complejidad de la comprobación del modelo de la lógica de agregación del juicio sobre representaciones relativamente sucintas de JAR será relativamente alta;Ahora demostramos que la complejidad de la lógica de la agregación de juicio de comprobación del modelo es tan difícil como resolver un número polinomial de problemas np-duros [9, pp.424-429]. Teorema 2. El problema de verificación del modelo para la lógica de agregación de juicio, suponiendo la representación de los frascos descritos anteriormente, es ΔP 2-Hard;Es NP-Hard incluso si la fórmula a verificar es de la forma ψ, donde ψ no contiene más o operadores. Prueba. Para ΔP 2 dardness, reducimos el SNSAT (secuencialmente anidados 2, por supuesto, no tenemos una forma general de verificar si cualquier máquina de Turing dada está garantizada para terminar en tiempo polinómico; el problema es indecidible. Como consecuencia, no siempre podemos verificar si una representación de una máquina de Turing particular de un frasco cumple con nuestros requisitos. Sin embargo, esto no evita que los frascos específicos estén tan representados, con pruebas correspondientes que terminan en tiempo polinomial.satisfilidad). Una instancia está dada por una serie de ecuaciones de la forma z1 = ∃x1.φ1 (x1) z2 = ∃x2.φ2 (x2, z1) z3 = ∃x3.φ3 (x3, z1, z2)...zk = ∃xk.φk (xk, z1, ..., zk - 1) donde x1 ,..., Xk son conjuntos de variables disjuntos, y cada φi (y) es una fórmula lógica proposicional sobre las variables y;La idea es que primero verificamos si φ1 (x1) es satisfactable, y si es así, asignamos a Z1 el valor verdadero, de lo contrario, lo asigna falso;Luego verificamos si φ2 es satisfactable bajo el supuesto de que Z1 toma el valor que acaba de obtener, y así sucesivamente. Por lo tanto, el resultado de cada ecuación depende del valor del anterior. El objetivo es determinar si ZK es cierto. Para reducir este problema a la verificación del modelo de lógica de agregación de juicio, primero solucionamos el frasco: esta regla simplemente copia el conjunto de juicio del Agente 1.(Claramente, esto puede ser implementado mediante una máquina Turing delimitada polinomialmente). Se supone que la agenda contiene las variables x1 ∪ · · · ∪ xk ∪ {z1 ,..., zk} y sus negaciones. Corrigimos el perfil de juicio inicial γ para ser x1 ∪ · · · ∪xk ∪ {z1 ,..., zk} y arreglar p = x1. Dada una variable xi, defina x ∗ i para ser (hxi ∧1). Si φi es una de las fórmulas φ1 ,..., φk, define φ ∗ i para ser la fórmula obtenida de φi sustituyendo sistemáticamente x ∗ i por cada variable xi y z ∗ i de manera similar. Ahora, definimos la función ξi para los números naturales i> 0 como: ξk = z ∗ 1 ↔ (φ ∗ 1) si i = 1 z ∗ i ↔ (φ ∗ i ∧i - 1 j = 1 ξj) de lo contrario. Y definimos la fórmula para verificar el modelo como: φ ∗ k ∧k - 1 j = 1 ξj ahora es sencillo de la construcción que esta fórmula es verdadera bajo la interpretación sif Zk es verdadera en la instancia de SNSAT. La prueba de la segunda mitad del teorema es inmediata del caso especial donde k = 1. 3.2 Algunas propiedades hemos definido un lenguaje que puede usarse para expresar propiedades de las reglas de agregación del juicio. Una pregunta interesante es entonces: ¿Cuáles son las propiedades universales de las reglas de agregación expresables en el lenguaje?¿Qué fórmulas son válidas? Aquí, para ilustrar la lógica, discutimos algunas de estas propiedades lógicas. En la Sección 5 damos una axiomatización completa de todos ellos. Recuerde que definimos el conjunto de resultados como el conjunto de todas las conjunciones con exactamente uno, posiblemente negado, átomo de σ. Sea p = {o ∧ σ, o ∧ ¬σ: o ∈ O};P ∈ P describe completamente las decisiones de los agentes y la función de agregación. Deje denotar exclusivo o. Tenemos eso: | = l p∈PP - Cualquier agente y el frasco siempre tienen que tomar una decisión | = L (i ∧ ¬J) → ¬i - Si algún agente puede pensar de manera diferente sobre un elemento que yo, entonces tambiénPuedo cambiar de opinión al respecto. De hecho, este principio se puede fortalecer a | = l (i ∧ ¬j) → (¬i ∧ j) | = l x - para cualquier x ∈ {i, ¬i, σ, ¬σ: i ∈ σ} - ambosLos agentes individuales y el frasco siempre juzgarán que algún elemento de la agenda es verdadero y, por el contrario, algún elemento de la agenda es falso | = L (I ∧ J) - Existen un juicio admisible establece de tal manera que los agentes que yo y J estén de acuerdo en algún juicio.| = L (i ↔ j) - Existen conjuntos de juicio admisibles de modo que los agentes que yo y J siempre están de acuerdo. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 569 La interpretación de las fórmulas depende de la agenda A y la lógica subyacente L, en la cuantificación sobre el conjunto J (A, L) de admisible, por ejemplo, L-Consistentes, perfiles de juicio. Tenga en cuenta que esto significa que alguna fórmula JAL podría ser válida bajo una lógica subyacente, mientras que no está bajo otra. Por ejemplo, si la agenda contiene alguna fórmula que es inconsistente en la lógica subyacente (y, por implicación, algo de tautología), entonces el siguiente retención: | = L (i ∧ σ) - Para cada perfil de juicio, hay algún elemento de la agenda(Tome una tautología) que tanto el agente I como los jueces de JAR sean verdaderos, pero esta propiedad no se mantiene cuando cada elemento de la agenda es consistente con respecto a la lógica subyacente. Una de esas agenda y lógica subyacente se discutirán en la Sección 6. 4. Ejemplos de expresividad La no dictadura se puede expresar de la siguiente manera: nd = i∈σ ¬ (σ ↔ i) (1) lemma 1. f | = l nd iff f tiene la propiedad nd1. La independencia se puede expresar de la siguiente manera: ind = o∈O ((o ∧ σ) → (o → σ)) (2) lemma 2. f | = l ind iff f tiene la propiedad ind. La unanimidad se puede expresar de la siguiente manera: una = ((1 ∧ · · · ∧ n) → σ) (3) lemma 3. f | = l una iff f tiene la propiedad una.4.1 La paradoja discursiva como se ilustra en el Ejemplo 1, la siguiente fórmula expresa votación de la mayoría en cuanto a la proposición sobre alguna proposición P MV = σ ↔ G⊆σ, | G |> n 2 i∈G I (4) es decir, la siguiente propiedad deun jar f y perfil admisible A1 ,..., An: p ∈ F (a1, ..., an) ⇔ | {i: p ∈ Ai} |> | {i: p ai} |F | = MV exactamente si F F tiene la propiedad anterior para todos los perfiles y proposiciones de juicio. Sin embargo, tenemos lo siguiente en nuestra lógica. Suponga que la agenda contiene al menos dos fórmulas distintas y su implicación material (es decir, A contiene P, Q, P → Q para algunos P, Q ∈ L (L)). Proposición 1 (paradoja discursiva).| = L ((MV) → ⊥) Cuando hay al menos tres agentes y la agenda contiene al menos dos fórmulas distintas y su implicación material. Prueba. Suponga lo contrario, por ejemplo, que a = {P, P → Q, Q, ¬P, ¬ (P → Q), ¬Q ,...} y existe una regla de agregación F sobre un modo que f | = l (σ ↔ g⊆σ, | g |> n 2 i∈G i). Sea γ el perfil de juicio γ = a1, a2, a3 donde a1 = {p, p → q, q ,...}, A2 = {p, ¬ (p → q), ¬q ,...} y a3 = {¬P, P → Q, ¬Q ,...}. Tenemos que f, γ, p | = l (σ ↔ g⊆σ, | g |> n 2 i∈G i) para cualquier p, entonces f, γ, p | = l σ ↔ g⊆σ, | g|> n 2 i∈G i. Debido a que F, γ, P | = L 1 ∧ 2, se deduce que F, γ, P | = L σ. De manera similar, se deduce que F, γ, P → Q | = L σ y F, γ, Q | = L ¬σ. En otras palabras, p ∈ F (γ), P → Q ∈ F (γ) y Q F (γ). Ya que f (γ) está completo, ¬Q ∈ F (γ). Pero eso contradice el hecho de que F (γ) debe ser consistente. La Proposición 1 es una declaración lógica de una variante del dilema discursivo bien conocido: si tres agentes votan sobre las proposiciones P, Q y P → Q, la votación de la mayoría en cuanto a la proposición podría no producir un resultado consistente.5. Axiomatización dada una lógica subyacente L, una agenda finita A sobre L, y un conjunto de agentes σ, la lógica de agregación de juicio (Jal (L), o simplemente Jal cuando se entiende) para el lenguaje l (σ, a), se defineEn la Tabla 2. ¬ (HP ∧ HQ) si P Q Atmost P∈A HP al menos hp p ∈ A Agenda (HP ∧ ϕ) → (HP → ϕ) una vez (HP ∧ X) ∨ (HP ∧ X) CPJS Todas las instantes deTautologías proposicionales Taut (ψ1 → ψ2) → (ψ1 → ψ2) k ψ → ψ t ψ → ψ 4 ψ ψ → ¬ ψ 5 (i ∧ ¬j) → o∈O o c ψ ψ (com) de P1,...Pn L Q infer (hp1 ∧ x) ∧ · · · ∧ (hpn ∧ x) → (hq → x) ∧ (hq → ¬x) del cierre de ϕ → ψ e ϕ infer ψ mp de ψ infer ψ neclec tabla 2:La lógica Jal (l) para el lenguaje L (σ, a).P, PI, Q Range sobre la agenda a;φ, ψ, ψi sobre L (σ, a);x sobre {σ, i: i ∈ σ};encima { , };i, j sobre σ;o Sobre el conjunto de resultados O. HP significa HQ cuando P = ¬Q para algunas Q, de lo contrario significa H¬p. L es la lógica subyacente. Los primeros 5 axiomas representan propiedades de una tabla y de conjuntos de juicio. Axiom Atmost dice que hay como máximo un elemento en la mesa a la vez, y al menos dice que siempre tenemos un elemento en la mesa. La agenda de Axiom dice que cada elemento de la agenda aparecerá en la mesa, mientras que una vez dice que cada elemento de la agenda solo aparece en la mesa una vez. Tenga en cuenta que una conjunción HP ∧ x dice: El ítem P está en la agenda, y X está a favor de ella, o X juzga que es cierto. Axiom CPJS corresponde al requisito de que los conjuntos de juicio estén completos. Tenga en cuenta que de la agenda, los CSJ y los CPJs derivamos el esquema X ∧ ¬x, que dice que todos deberían expresar al menos una opinión a favor de algo y en contra de algo. Los axiomas tensos - 5 son bien familiarizados con la lógica modal: reflejan directamente la cuantificación sin restricciones en la definición de verdad de y. Axiom C dice que para cualquier elemento de la agenda para el cual es posible tener opiniones opuestas, todos los resultados posibles para ese elemento deberían ser alcanzables. Comm dice que todo lo que es cierto para un perfil y elemento arbitrarios, también es cierto para un elemento y perfil arbitrario. El cierre garantiza que los agentes se comporten constantemente con respecto a las consecuencias en la lógica L. MP y NEC son estándar. Usamos Jal (L) para denotar la derivabilidad en Jal (L). Teorema 3. Si la agenda es finita, tenemos eso para cualquier fórmula ψ ∈ L (σ, a), Jal (l) ψ iff | = l ψ. Prueba. La solidez es sencilla. Para completar (nos centramos en la idea principal aquí y dejamos de lado los detalles triviales), construimos un 570 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Tabla Jal para una fórmula consistente ψ de la siguiente manera. De hecho, nuestra axiomatización determina completamente una tabla, excepto por el comportamiento de f.Para ser más precisos, deje que una descripción de la tabla sea una conjunción de la forma HP ∧ O ∧ (¬) σ. Es fácil ver que las descripciones de la tabla son mutuamente excluyentes y, además, podemos derivar τ∈T τ, donde t es el conjunto de todas las descripciones de la tabla. Sea D el conjunto de todos los conjuntos consistentes máximos δ. No queremos todos esos: bien podría ser que ψ requiere que σ sea de cierta manera, lo cual es incompatible con algunos Δs. Definimos dos relaciones de accesibilidad de la manera estándar: R Δ1Δ2 IFF para todos ψ: ψ ∈ Δ1 ⇒ ψ ∈ Δ2. Del mismo modo para R con respecto a. Ambas relaciones son equivalencias (debido a Taut-5), y además, cuando R Δ1Δ2 y R Δ2Δ3 entonces para algunos Δ2, también R Δ1Δ2 y R Δ2Δ3 (debido a la comunicación del axioma). Sea Δ0 un MCS que contiene ψ. Ahora definimos las Tablas de establecimiento = {Δ0} ∪ {Δ1, Δ2 |(R Δ0Δ1 y R Δ1Δ2) o (R Δ0Δ1 y R Δ1Δ2)} Cada tablas δ ∈ puede concebirse como un par γ, P, ya que cada δ contiene un único (HQ ∧ O ∧ (¬) σ) para cada HQ y HQ yun HP único. Entonces es fácil de verificar que, para cada tablas Δ ∈, y cada fórmula ϕ, δ | = ϕ Iff ϕ ∈ δ, donde | = aquí significa la verdad en el sentido lógico modal ordinario cuando el conjunto de estados se toma como tablas. Ahora, extraemos una función de agregación F y los pares γ, P de la siguiente manera: para cada tablas Δ ∈, encuentre una conjunción HP ∧ O ∧ (¬) σ. Habrá exactamente uno de esos p.Esto define la P que estamos buscando. Además, se obtiene el γ, para cada agente I, al encontrar todo Q para el cual (HQ ∧ I) es actualmente cierto. Finalmente, la función F es una tabla de todas las tuplas HP, O (P), σ para la cual (HP ∧ O (O) ∧ σ) está contenida en algún conjunto en tablas. Señalamos que Jal tiene todos los axiomas tensos, k, t, 4, 5 y las reglas MP y NEC de la lógica modal S5. Sin embargo, la sustitución uniforme, un principio de todas las lógicas modales normales (cf., por ejemplo, [3]), no se mantiene. Un contador es el hecho de que lo siguiente es válido: σ (5) - No importa qué preferencias tienen los agentes, el frasno necesariamente hará los mismos juicios que el agente i. Entonces, por ejemplo, tenemos que la paradoja discursiva es demostrable en Jal (l): Jal (L) ((MV) → ⊥). En la Tabla 3. 6 se muestra un ejemplo de derivación de la propiedad menos complicada (válida) (i ∧ j). La agregación de preferencias recientemente, Dietrich y List [5] mostraron que la agregación de preferencias puede integrarse en la agregación del juicio. En esta sección mostramos que nuestra lógica de agregación de juicio también puede usarse para razonar sobre la agregación de preferencias. Dado un conjunto K de alternativas, [5] define una lógica de predicado simple LK con el lenguaje L (LK) de la siguiente manera: • L (LK) tiene una constante A para cada alternativa A ∈ K, Variables V1, V2 ,..., Un predicado de identidad binaria =, un predicado binario P para preferencia estricta, y los conectivos proposicionales y de primer orden∀V3 (((V1PV2 ∧ V2PV3) → V1PV3) - ∀V1 ∀V2 (¬V1 = V2 → (V1PV2 ∨ V2PV1)) • Cuando γ ⊆ L (LK) y φ es una fórmula, γ | = φ está definido para retenerIFF γ ∪ Z implica φ en el sentido estándar de lógica de predicado 1 (HP ∧ I) ∨ (HP ∧ I) CPJS (I) 2 (HP ∧ J) ∨ (HP ∧ J) CPJS (J) 3 Llama 1 A ∨B y 2 C ∨ D Abreviatura, 1, 2 4 (A ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ D) ∨ (B ∧ C) ∨ (B ∧ D) Taut, 3 5 Derive (I ∧ J) de cada disyuntamiento de 4La estrategia es ∨ Elim 6 (HP ∧ I) ∧ (HP ∧ J) Suponga A ∧ C 7 (HP → (I ∧ J)) Una vez, 6, K () 8 (I ∧ J) 7, Agenda 9 (I ∧j) 8, t () 10 (HP ∧ I) ∧ (HP ∧ J) Suponga A ∧ D 11 (HP ∧ X) ↔ (HP ∧ ¬ ¬x), Cierre 12 (HP ∧ I) ∧ (HP ∧ ¬J) 10, 11 13 (HP ∧ I ∧ ¬J) 12, una vez, k () 14 (i ∧ ¬j) 13, Taut 15 (i ∧ ¬j) 14, k () 16 (i ∧ ¬j)15, Comm 17 (I ∧ D¬j) 16, K () 18 (I ∧ J) 17, C 19 (HP ∧ I) ∧ (HP ∧ J) Suponga que B ∧ D 20 va como 6-9 21 (HP (HP∧ i) ∧ (HP ∧ J) Suponga que B ∧ C 22 va como 10 - 18 23 (I ∧ J) ∨ -ELIM, 1, 2, 9, 18, 20, 22 Tabla 3: Derivación de jarras de (I ∧ J) Es fácil ver que existe una correspondencia uno a uno entre el conjunto de relaciones de preferencia (órdenes lineales totales) sobre K y el conjunto de conjuntos de juicio con consistentes y completos de LK sobre la agenda de preferencias AK = {APB, ¬APB: A, B ∈ K, A B} Dado un SWF F sobre K, el jar correspondiente FF sobre la agenda de preferencia AK se define como sigue FF (A1 ,..., An) = a, donde a es el conjunto de juicio consistente y completo correspondiente a f (l1, ..., ln) donde li es la relación de preferencia correspondiente al conjunto de juicio consistente y completo AI. Por lo tanto, podemos usar JAL para razonar sobre la agregación de preferencias de la siguiente manera. Tome el lenguaje lógico L (σ, AK), para un conjunto de agentes σ, y tome la lógica subyacente como LK. Luego podemos interpretar nuestras fórmulas en un swf f sobre k, un perfil de preferencia l ∈ L (k) y un par (a, b) ⊆ k × k, a b, como sigue: f, l, (a, b) |= swf φ ⇔ ff, γl, apb | = lk φ donde γl es el perfil de juicio correspondiente al perfil de preferencia L., mientras que en el caso de agregación de juicio general, una fórmula se interpreta en el contexto de un elemento de la agenda, en el caso de la agregación de preferenciasUna fórmula se interpreta así en el contexto de un par de alternativas. Ejemplo 2. Tres agentes deben decidir entre ir a cenar (d), una película (M) o un concierto (c). Sus preferencias individuales se ilustran a la derecha en la Tabla 1 en la Sección 3, junto con el resultado de un SWF FMAJ que implementa la votación de la mayoría en pareja. Sea L = MDC, MCD, CMD el perfil de preferencia correspondiente a las preferencias en el ejemplo. Tenemos lo siguiente: • FMAJ, L, (M, D) | = SWF 1 ∧ 2 ∧ 3 (Todos los agentes están de acuerdo, bajo las clasificaciones individuales L, en la clasificación relativa de M y Dthey está de acuerdo en que D es mejor que M)• fmaj, l, (m, d) | = swf ¬ (1 ↔ 2) (bajo las clasificaciones individuales l, hay algunos par de alternativas en las que los agentes 1 y 2 no están de acuerdo) el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 571 • FMAJ, L, (M, D) | = SWF (1 ∧ 2) (los agentes 1 y 2 pueden elegir sus preferencias de manera que estén de acuerdo en algunos par de alternativas) • fmaj, l, (m, d) | = swf σ ↔ g⊆ {1,2,3}, | g | ≥2 i∈G I (el swf fmaj implementa la votación de la mayoría en cuanto a pares) Como de costumbre, nosotros, nosotros, nosotrosescribir f | = swf φ cuando f, l, (a, b) | = swf φ para cualquier l y (a, b), y así sucesivamente. Por lo tanto, nuestras fórmulas pueden verse como una expresión de propiedades de las funciones de bienestar social. Ejemplo 3. Tome la fórmula (i ↔ σ). Cuando esta fórmula se interpreta como una declaración sobre una función de bienestar social, dice que existe un perfil de preferencia de tal manera que para todos los pares (a, b) de alternativas, B se prefiera sobre A en la agregación (por el SWF) delPerfil de preferencia si y solo si el agente I prefiere B sobre a.6.1 Ejemplos de expresividad Hacemos preciso la afirmación en la Sección 2.2 que las tres propiedades SWF mencionadas corresponden a las tres propiedades de JAR mencionadas, respectivamente. Recuerde las fórmulas definidas en la Sección 4. Proposición 2. F | = swf nd iff f tiene la propiedad nd2 f | = swf ind iff f tiene la propiedad iia f | = swf una iff f tiene la propiedad PO Las propiedades expresadas anteriormente son propiedades de SWFS. Veamos ahora las propiedades del conjunto de alternativas k que podemos expresar. Las propiedades que involucran cardinalidad son a menudo de interés, por ejemplo, en el teorema de flechas. Sea: mt2 = ((1 ∧ 2) ∧ (1 ∧ ¬2)) Proposición 3. Sea f ∈ F (k).| K |> 2 iff f | = swf mt2. Prueba. Para la dirección a la izquierda, deje f | = swf mt2. Por lo tanto, hay un γ de tal manera que existe (A1, B1), (A2, B2) ∈ K × K, donde A1 B1 y A2 B2, de modo que (i) A1 Pb1 ∈ γ1, (ii) A1 Pb1 ∈γ2, (iii) A2 Pb2 ∈ γ1 y (IV) A2 PB2 γ2. De (ii) e (iv) obtenemos que (a1, b1) (a2, b2), y de eso y (i) y (iii) se deduce que γ1 contiene dos pares diferentes a1 pb1 y a2 pb2 cada uno con dos diferenteselementos. Pero eso no es posible si | K |= 2, porque si k = {a, b} entonces ak = {apb, ¬apb, bpa, ¬bpa} y, por lo tanto, es imposible que γ1 ⊆ ak ya que no podemos tener apb, bpa ∈ γ1. Para la dirección a la derecha, deje | K |> 2;Sea A, B, C tres elementos distintos de K. Sea γ1 el conjunto de juicio correspondiente a la clasificación ABC y γ2 El conjunto de juicio correspondiente a ACB. Ahora, para cualquier regla de agregación F, F, γ, APB | = 1 ∧ 2 y F, γ, BPC | = 1 ∧ ¬2. Por lo tanto, f | = swf mt2, para cualquier swf F. Ahora tenemos todo lo que necesitamos para expresar la declaración de flechas como una fórmula. De su teorema se deduce que la fórmula es válida en la clase de todas las funciones de bienestar social. Teorema 4. | = swf mt2 → ¬ (po ∧ nd ∧ iia) prueba. Tenga en cuenta que MT2, PO, ND e IIA son verdaderas propiedades SWF, su valor de verdad WRT.Una tabla está determinada únicamente por el SWF. Por ejemplo, F, L, (a, b) | = swf mt2 iff f | = mt2, para cualquier f, l, a, b. Deje f ∈ F (k) y f, l, (a, b) | = swf mt2 para algunos l y a, b. Por la Proposición 3, K tiene más de dos alternativas. Por el teorema de flechas, F no puede tener todas las propiedades PO, ND2 e IIA. W.L.O.G Suponga que F no tiene la propiedad PO. Por la Proposición 2, F | = SWF PO. Dado que PO es una propiedad SWF, esto significa que F, L, (a, b) | = swf po (la satisfacción de PO es independiente de L, a, b), y por lo tanto que f, l, (a, b) |= swf ¬po ∨ ¬nd ∨ ¬iia. Tenga en cuenta que la fórmula en el Teorema 4 no menciona ningún elemento de la agenda (es decir, pares de alternativas) como HAPB directamente en una expresión. Esto significa que la fórmula es un miembro de L (σ, AK) para cualquier conjunto de alternativas k, y es válida sin importar qué conjunto de alternativas supongamos. La fórmula MV que en el caso de la agregación de juicio general expresa la votación de la mayoría en cuanto a la proposición, expresa en la votación de la mayoría de pares de la agregación de preferencias, como se ilustra en el Ejemplo 2. El corresponsal de agregación de preferencias a la paradoja discursiva de la agregación de juicio es la conocida paradoja de votación de Condorcets, afirmando que la votación de la mayoría en cuanto a pares puede conducir a preferencias agregadas que son cíclicas (incluso si las preferencias individuales no lo son). Podemos expresar la paradoja de Condorcets de la siguiente manera, nuevamente como una propiedad lógica universalmente válida de SWFS. Proposición 4. | = SWF MT2 → ¬MV, cuando hay al menos tres agentes. Prueba. La prueba es similar a la prueba de la paradoja discursiva. Sea FF, γ, APB | = LK MT2;Por lo tanto, hay tres elementos distintos a, b, c ∈ K. Suponga que FF, γ, APB | = LK MV. Sea γ el perfil de juicio correspondiente al perfil de preferencia x = (ABC, CAB, BCA). Tenemos ese ff, γ, apb | = lk 1 ∧ 2 y, desde que ff, γ, apb | = lk mv, tenemos ese ff, γ, apb | = lk σ y, por lo tanto, apb ∈ Ff (γ) y ((a, b) ∈ F (x). De manera similar, obtenemos eso (c, a) ∈ F (x) y (b, c) ∈ F (x). Pero eso es imposible, ya que por transitividad también tendríamos que (a, c) ∈ F (x) lo que contradice el hecho de que F (x) es antisimétrico. Por lo tanto, se deduce que FF, γ, APB | = LK MV.6.2 Axiomatización y propiedades lógicas obtenemos inmediatamente, desde el teorema 3, una axiomatización sólida y completa de la agregación de preferencias sobre un conjunto finito de alternativas. Corolario 1. Si el conjunto de alternativas k es finito, tenemos eso para cualquier fórmula ψ ∈ L (σ, Ak), Jal (LK) ψ iff | = swf ψ. Prueba. Sigue inmediatamente desde el teorema 3 y del hecho de que para cualquier jar F, hay un swf f tal que f = ff. Entonces, por ejemplo, el teorema de flechas es demostrable en Jal (LK): Jal (LK) MT2 → ¬ (PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA). Cada fórmula que es válida con respecto a las reglas de agregación del juicio también es válida con respecto a las funciones de bienestar social, por lo que todas las propiedades lógicas generales de los frascos también son propiedades de SWF. Dependiendo de la agenda, los SWF pueden tener propiedades adicionales, inducidas por la lógica LK, que no siempre son compartidas por frascos con otras lógicas subyacentes. Una de esas propiedades es i. Si bien tenemos | = swf i, para otras agendas hay lógicas subyacentes que | = l i para ver a este último, tomar una agenda con una fórmula P que es inconsistente en la lógica subyacente que nunca se puede incluir en unjuicio establecido. Para ver el primero, tome un par de alternativas arbitrarias (A, B). Existe un perfil de preferencia en el que el agente I prefiere B sobre a.Técnicamente hablando, la fórmula I sostiene en SWFS porque la agenda AK no contiene una fórmula que (solo) es WRT inconsistente.La lógica subyacente lk. Por la misma razón, las siguientes propiedades también se mantienen en SWF pero no en frascos en general.| = swf o∈O o 572 el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07): para cualquier par de alternativas (a, b), es posible cualquier posible combinación de la clasificación relativa de A y B entre los agentes.| = swf I → ¬i - Dada una alternativa B que se prefiere sobre alguna otra alternativa A por el Agente I, hay algún otro par de alternativas C y D de modo que D no se prefiere sobre C - a saber (C, D) = = =(B, A).| = swf ((i ∨ j) → (i ∧ ¬j)) - Si, dadas las preferencias de los agentes y un SWF, para cualquiera de las dos alternativas, siempre es el caso que el agente I o el agente j prefieran la segunda alternativa sobre elPrimero, entonces debe existir un par de alternativas para las cuales los dos agentes no están de acuerdo. Una justificación es que ningún agente único puede preferir la segunda alternativa sobre la primera para cada par de alternativas, por lo que en este caso si prefiere B sobre una J debe preferir A Over B. Una vez más, esta propiedad no necesariamente se mantiene para otras agendas, porque la agenda podría contener una inconsistencia sobre las que los agentes no podrían estar en desacuerdo. Prueba teóricamente, estas propiedades adicionales de los SWF se derivan utilizando la regla de cierre.7. Trabajo relacionado Las lógicas formales relacionadas con la elección social se han centrado principalmente en la representación lógica de las preferencias cuando el conjunto de alternativas es grande y en las propiedades de cálculo de las preferencias agregadas informáticas para una representación dada [6, 7, 8]. Una excepción notable y reciente es un marco lógico para la agregación del juicio desarrollado por Marc Pauly en [10], para poder caracterizar las relaciones lógicas entre las diferentes reglas de agregación de juicio. Si bien la motivación es similar al trabajo en este documento, los enfoques son fundamentalmente diferentes: en [10], los posibles resultados de aplicar una regla a algún perfil de juicio se toman como primarios y se describen axiomáticamente;En nuestro enfoque, la regla de agregación y sus posibles insumos, es decir, los perfiles de juicio, se toman como primarios y se describen axiomáticamente. Los dos enfoques no parecen estar directamente relacionados entre sí en el sentido de que uno puede ser incrustado en el otro. La lógica de flecha de lógica modal [11] está diseñada para razonar sobre cualquier objeto que pueda representarse gráficamente como una flecha, y tiene varios operadores modales para expresar propiedades y relaciones entre estas flechas. En la lógica de agregación de preferencias Jal (LK) interpretamos fórmulas en pares de alternativas, que pueden verse como flechas. Por lo tanto, (al menos) la variante de agregación de preferencias de nuestra lógica está relacionada con la lógica de flecha. Sin embargo, si bien los operadores modales de la lógica de flecha pueden expresar propiedades de las relaciones de preferencia, como la transitividad, no pueden expresar directamente la mayoría de las propiedades que hemos discutido en este documento. Sin embargo, la relación con la lógica de Arrow podría investigarse más a fondo en el trabajo futuro. En particular, las lógicas de flecha generalmente se demuestran WRT.un álgebra. Esto podría significar que podría ser posible usar las álgebras como la estructura subyacente para representar las preferencias individuales y colectivas. Luego, cambiar el perfil de preferencia nos lleva de un álgebra a otro, y un SWF determina la preferencia colectiva, en cada una de las álgebras.8. Discusión Hemos presentado una lógica sólida y completa Jal para representar y razonar sobre la agregación del juicio.Jal es expresivo: puede expresar reglas de agregación de juicio, como la votación mayoritaria;propiedades complicadas como la independencia;y resultados importantes como la paradoja discursiva, el teorema de flechas y la paradoja de los condorcetos. Argumentamos que estos resultados muestran exactamente qué capacidades lógicas necesita un agente para poder razonar sobre la agregación del juicio. Quizás sea sorprendente que un lenguaje relativamente simple proporcione estas capacidades.Jal proporciona una teoría de prueba, en la cual los resultados como los mencionados anteriormente pueden derivarse3. La axiomatización describe los principios lógicos de la agregación del juicio, y también se puede instanciar para razonar sobre casos específicos de agregación del juicio, como la agregación clásica de preferencia de Arrovia. Por lo tanto, nuestro marco arroja luz sobre las diferencias entre los principios lógicos detrás de la agregación de juicio general, por un lado, y la agregación de preferencias clásicas por el otro. En el trabajo futuro, sería interesante relajar los requisitos de integridad y consistencia de los conjuntos de juicio, e intentar caracterizarlos en el lenguaje lógico, como propiedades de juicio general, en su lugar.9.

        "One of the goals of this paper is to investigate the representational and logical capabilities an agent needs for judgment and preference aggregation; that is, what kind of logical language might be used to represent and reason about judgment aggregation?",

        "In order to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be able to express, take the example of a potential property of social welfare functions (SWFs) called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): given two preference profiles (each consisting of one preference relation for each agent) and two alternatives, if for each agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference profiles, then the two alternatives must have the same order in the two preference relations resulting from applying the SWF to the two preference profiles, respectively.",

        "From (ii) and (iv) we get that (a1 , b1 ) (a2 , b2 ), and from that and (i) and (iii) it follows that γ1 contains two different pairs a1 Pb1 and a2 Pb2 each having two different elements.",

        "Let F ∈ F (K), and F, L, (a, b) |=swf MT2 for some L and a, b.",
        "By Proposition 3, K has more than two alternatives.",
        "By Arrows theorem, F cannot have all the properties PO, ND2 and IIA.",
        "W.l.o.g assume that F does not have the PO property.",
        "By Proposition 2, F |=swf PO.",
        "Since PO is a SWF property, this means that F, L, (a, b) |=swf PO (satisfaction of PO is independent of L, a, b), and thus that F, L, (a, b) |=swf ¬PO ∨ ¬ND ∨ ¬IIA.",
        "Note that the formula in Theorem 4 does not mention any agenda items (i.e., pairs of alternatives) such as haPb directly in an expression.",
        "This means that the formula is a member of L(Σ, AK ) for any set of alternatives K, and is valid no matter which set of alternatives we assume.",
        "The formula MV which in the general judgment aggregation case expresses proposition-wise majority voting, expresses in the preference aggregation case pair-wise majority voting, as illustrated in Example 2.",
        "The preference aggregation correspondent to the discursive paradox of judgment aggregation is the well known Condorcets voting paradox, stating that pair-wise majority voting can lead to aggregated preferences which are cyclic (even if the individual preferences are not).",
        "We can express Condorcets paradox as follows, again as a universally valid logical property of SWFs.",
        "Proposition 4. |=swf MT2 → ¬MV, when there are at least three agents.",
        "Proof.",
        "The proof is similar to the proof of the discursive paradox.",
        "Let fF , γ, aPb |=LK MT2; there are thus three distinct elements a, b, c ∈ K. Assume that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV.",
        "Let γ be the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile X = (abc, cab, bca).",
        "We have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK 1 ∧ 2 and, since fF , γ , aPb |=LK MV, we have that fF , γ , aPb |=LK σ and thus that aPb ∈ fF (γ ) and (a, b) ∈ F(X).",
        "In a similar manner we get that (c, a) ∈ F(X) and (b, c) ∈ F(X).",
        "But that is impossible, since by transitivity we would also have that (a, c) ∈ F(X) which contradicts the fact that F(X) is antisymmetric.",
        "Thus, it follows that fF , γ, aPb |=LK MV. 6.2 Axiomatisation and Logical Properties We immediately get, from Theorem 3, a sound and complete axiomatisation of preference aggregation over a finite set of alternatives.",
        "Corollary 1.",
        "If the set of alternatives K is finite, we have that for any formula ψ ∈ L(Σ, AK ), JAL(LK ) ψ iff |=swf ψ.",
        "Proof.",
        "Follows immediately from Theorem 3 and the fact that for any JAR f, there is a SWF F such that f = fF .",
        "So, for example, Arrows theorem is provable in jal(LK ): JAL(LK ) MT2 → ¬(PO ∧ ND ∧ IIA).",
        "Every formula which is valid with respect to judgment aggregation rules is also valid with respect to social welfare functions, so all general logical properties of JARs are also properties of SWFs.",
        "Depending on the agenda, SWFs may have additional properties, induced by the logic LK , which are not always shared by JARs with other underlying logics.",
        "One such property is i.",
        "While we have |=swf i, for other agendas there are underlying logics L such that |=L i To see the latter, take an agenda with a formula p which is inconsistent in the underlying logic L - p can never be included in a judgment set.",
        "To see the former, take an arbitrary pair of alternatives (a, b).",
        "There exists some preference profile in which agent i prefers b over a. Technically speaking, the formula i holds in SWFs because the agenda AK does not contain a formula which (alone) is inconsistent wrt. the underlying logic LK .",
        "By the same reason, the following properties also hold in SWFs but not in JARs in general. |=swf o∈O o 572 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) - for any pair of alternatives (a, b), any possible combination of the relative ranking of a and b among the agents is possible. |=swf i → ¬i - given an alternative b which is preferred over some other alternative a by agent i, there is some other pair of alternatives c and d such that d is not preferred over c - namely (c, d) = (b, a). |=swf ( (i ∨ j) → (i ∧ ¬j)) - if, given preferences of agents and a SWF, for any two alternatives it is always the case that either agent i or agent j prefers the second alternative over the first, then there must exist a pair of alternatives for which the two agents disagree.",
        "A justification is that no single agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair of alternatives, so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer a over b.",
        "Again, this property does not necessarily hold for other agendas, because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the agents could not possibly disagree upon.",
        "Proof theoretically, these additional properties of SWFs are derived using the Closure rule. 7.",
        "RELATED WORK Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8].",
        "A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different judgment aggregation rules.",
        "While the motivation is similar to the work in this paper, the approaches are fundamentally different: in [10], the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically; in our approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs, i.e., judgment profiles, are taken as primary and described axiomatically.",
        "The two approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the sense that one can be embedded in the other.",
        "The modal logic arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows.",
        "In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows.",
        "Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.",
        "However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.",
        "Nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investigated further in future work.",
        "In particular, arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt. an algebra.",
        "This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and collective preferences.",
        "Then, changing the preference profile takes us from one algebra to another, and a SWF determines the collective preference, in each of the algebras. 8.",
        "DISCUSSION We have presented a sound and complete logic jal for representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation. jal is expressive: it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting; complicated properties such as independence; and important results such as the discursive paradox, Arrows theorem and Condorcets paradox.",
        "We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about judgment aggregation.",
        "It is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities. jal provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 .",
        "The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian preference aggregation.",
        "Thus our framework sheds light on the differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other.",
        "In future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets, and try to characterise these in the logical language, as properties of general judgment sets, instead. 9.",

                "In order to illustrate in more detail what such a language would need to be able to express, take the example of a potential property of social welfare functions (SWFs) called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): given two preference profiles (each consisting of one preference relation for each agent) and two alternatives, if for each agent the two alternatives have the same order in the two preference profiles, then the two alternatives must have the same order in the two preference relations resulting from applying the SWF to the two preference profiles, respectively.",

                "Given a set K of alternatives, [5] defines a simple predicate logic LK with language L(LK ) as follows: • L(LK ) has one constant a for each alternative a ∈ K, variables v1, v2, . . ., a binary identity predicate =, a binary predicate P for strict preference, and the usual propositional and first order connectives • Z is the collection of the following axioms: - ∀v1 ∀v2 (v1Pv2 → ¬v2Pv1) - ∀v1 ∀v2 ∀v3 ((v1Pv2 ∧ v2Pv3) → v1Pv3) - ∀v1 ∀v2 (¬v1 = v2 → (v1Pv2 ∨ v2Pv1)) • When Γ ⊆ L(LK ) and φ is a formula, Γ |= φ is defined to hold iff Γ ∪ Z entails φ in the standard sense of predicate logic 1 (hp ∧ i) ∨ (hp ∧ i) CpJS(i) 2 (hp ∧ j) ∨ (hp ∧ j) CpJS(j) 3 Call 1 A ∨ B and 2 C ∨ D abbreviation, 1, 2 4 (A ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ D) ∨ (B ∧ C) ∨ (B ∧ D) taut, 3 5 derive (i ∧ j) from every disjunct of 4 strategy is ∨ elim 6 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume A ∧ C 7 (hp → (i ∧ j)) Once, 6, K( ) 8 (i ∧ j) 7, Agenda 9 (i ∧ j) 8, T( ) 10 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume A ∧ D 11 (hp ∧ x) ↔ (hp ∧ ¬x) Agenda, Closure 12 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ ¬j) 10, 11 13 (hp ∧ i ∧ ¬j) 12, Once, K( ) 14 (i ∧ ¬j) 13, taut 15 (i ∧ ¬j) 14, K( ) 16 (i ∧ ¬j) 15, COMM 17 ( i ∧ D¬j) 16, K( ) 18 (i ∧ j) 17, C 19 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume B ∧ D 20 goes as 6-9 21 (hp ∧ i) ∧ (hp ∧ j) assume B ∧ C 22 goes as 10 - 18 23 (i ∧ j) ∨-elim, 1, 2, 9, 18, 20, 22 Table 3: jar derivation of (i ∧ j) It is easy to see that there is an one-to-one correspondence between the set of preference relations (total linear orders) over K and the set of LK -consistent and complete judgment sets over the preference agenda AK = {aPb, ¬aPb : a, b ∈ K, a b} Given a SWF F over K, the corresponding JAR fF over the preference agenda AK is defined as follows fF (A1, . . . , An) = A, where A is the consistent and complete judgment set corresponding to F(L1, . . . , Ln) where Li is the preference relation corresponding to the consistent and complete judgment set Ai.",

                "We can then interpret our formulae in an SWF F over K, a preference profile L ∈ L(K) and a pair (a, b) ⊆ K × K, a b, as follows: F, L, (a, b) |=swf φ ⇔ fF , γL , aPb |=LK φ where γL is the judgment profile corresponding to the preference profile L. While in the general judgment aggregation case a formula is interpreted in the context of an agenda item, in the preference aggregation case a formula is thus interpreted in the context of a pair of alternatives.",

                "Every formula which is valid with respect to judgment aggregation rules is also valid with respect to social welfare functions, so all general logical properties of JARs are also properties of SWFs.",
                "Depending on the agenda, SWFs may have additional properties, induced by the logic LK , which are not always shared by JARs with other underlying logics.",
                "One such property is i.",
                "While we have |=swf i, for other agendas there are underlying logics L such that |=L i To see the latter, take an agenda with a formula p which is inconsistent in the underlying logic L - p can never be included in a judgment set.",
                "To see the former, take an arbitrary pair of alternatives (a, b).",
                "There exists some preference profile in which agent i prefers b over a. Technically speaking, the formula i holds in SWFs because the agenda AK does not contain a formula which (alone) is inconsistent wrt. the underlying logic LK .",
                "By the same reason, the following properties also hold in SWFs but not in JARs in general. |=swf o∈O o 572 The Sixth Intl.",

                "A justification is that no single agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair of alternatives, so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer a over b.",
                "Again, this property does not necessarily hold for other agendas, because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the agents could not possibly disagree upon.",
                "Proof theoretically, these additional properties of SWFs are derived using the Closure rule. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8].",
                "A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different judgment aggregation rules.",
                "While the motivation is similar to the work in this paper, the approaches are fundamentally different: in [10], the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically; in our approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs, i.e., judgment profiles, are taken as primary and described axiomatically.",
                "The two approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the sense that one can be embedded in the other.",
                "The modal logic arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows.",
                "In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows.",
                "Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.",
                "However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.",
                "Nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investigated further in future work.",
                "In particular, arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt. an algebra.",
                "This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and collective preferences.",
                "Then, changing the preference profile takes us from one algebra to another, and a SWF determines the collective preference, in each of the algebras. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION We have presented a sound and complete logic jal for representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation. jal is expressive: it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting; complicated properties such as independence; and important results such as the discursive paradox, Arrows theorem and Condorcets paradox.",
                "We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about judgment aggregation.",
                "It is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities. jal provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 .",
                "The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian preference aggregation.",
                "Thus our framework sheds light on the differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other.",
                "In future work it would be interesting to relax the completeness and consistency requirements of judgment sets, and try to characterise these in the logical language, as properties of general judgment sets, instead. 9.",

                "It is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities. <br>jal</br> provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 .",

                "To see the former, take an arbitrary pair of alternatives (a, b).",
                "There exists some preference profile in which agent i prefers b over a. Technically speaking, the formula i holds in SWFs because the agenda AK does not contain a formula which (alone) is inconsistent wrt. the underlying logic LK .",

                "A justification is that no single agent can prefer the second alternative over the first for every pair of alternatives, so in this case if i prefers b over a then j must prefer a over b.",
                "Again, this property does not necessarily hold for other agendas, because the agenda might contain an inconsistency the agents could not possibly disagree upon.",

                "RELATED WORK Formal logics related to social choice have focused mostly on the logical representation of preferences when the set of alternatives is large and on the computation properties of computing aggregated preferences for a given representation [6, 7, 8].",
                "A notable and recent exception is a logical framework for judgment aggregation developed by Marc Pauly in [10], in order to be able to characterise the logical relationships between different judgment aggregation rules.",
                "While the motivation is similar to the work in this paper, the approaches are fundamentally different: in [10], the possible results from applying a rule to some judgment profile are taken as primary and described axiomatically; in our approach the aggregation rule and its possible inputs, i.e., judgment profiles, are taken as primary and described axiomatically.",
                "The two approaches do not seem to be directly related to each other in the sense that one can be embedded in the other.",
                "The <br>modal logic</br> arrow logic [11] is designed to reason about any object that can be graphically represented as an arrow, and has various modal operators for expressing properties of and relationships between these arrows.",
                "In the preference aggregation logic jal(LK ) we interpreted formulae in pairs of alternatives - which can be seen as arrows.",
                "Thus, (at least) the preference aggregation variant of our logic is related to arrow logic.",
                "However, while the modal operators of arrow logic can express properties of preference relations such as transitivity, they cannot directly express most of the properties we have discussed in this paper.",
                "Nevertheless, the relationship to arrow logic could be investigated further in future work.",
                "In particular, arrow logics are usually proven complete wrt. an algebra.",
                "This could mean that it might be possible to use such algebras as the underlying structure to represent individual and collective preferences.",
                "Then, changing the preference profile takes us from one algebra to another, and a SWF determines the collective preference, in each of the algebras. 8.",
                "DISCUSSION We have presented a sound and complete logic jal for representing and reasoning about judgment aggregation. jal is expressive: it can express judgment aggregation rules such as majority voting; complicated properties such as independence; and important results such as the discursive paradox, Arrows theorem and Condorcets paradox.",
                "We argue that these results show exactly which logical capabilities an agent needs in order to be able to reason about judgment aggregation.",
                "It is perhaps surprising that a relatively simple language provides these capabilities. jal provides a proof theory, in which results such as those mentioned above can be derived3 .",
                "The axiomatisation describes the logical principles of judgment aggregation, and can also be instantiated to reason about specific instances of judgment aggregation, such as classical Arrovian preference aggregation.",
                "Thus our framework sheds light on the differences between the logical principles behind general judgment aggregation on the one hand and classical preference aggregation on the other.",
