Rosenschein School of Engineering and Computer Science The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel {yori,jeff}@cs.huji.ac.il ABSTRACT Preference aggregation is used in a variety of multiagent applications, and as a result, voting theory has become an important topic in multiagent system research. However, power indices (which reflect how much real power a voter has in a weighted voting system) have received relatively little attention, although they have long been studied in political science and economics. The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular; it is also well-defined for any simple coalitional game. In this paper, we examine the computational complexity of calculating the Banzhaf power index within a particular multiagent domain, a network flow game. Agents control the edges of a graph; a coalition wins if it can send a flow of a given size from a source vertex to a target vertex. The relative power of each edge/agent reflects its significance in enabling such a flow, and in real-world networks could be used, for example, to allocate resources for maintaining parts of the network. We show that calculating the Banzhaf power index of each agent in this network flow domain is #P-complete. We also show that for some restricted network flow domains there exists a polynomial algorithm to calculate agents Banzhaf power indices.

INTRODUCTION Social choice theory can serve as an appropriate foundation upon which to build multiagent applications. There is a rich literature on the subject of voting1 from political science, mathematics, and economics, with important theoretical results, and builders of automated agents can benefit from this work as they engineer systems that reach group consensus. Interest in the theory of economics and social choice has in fact become widespread throughout computer science, because it is recognized as having direct implications on the building of systems comprised of multiple automated agents [16, 4, 22, 17, 14, 8, 15]. What distinguishes computer science work in these areas is its concern for computational issues: how are results arrived at (e.g., equilibrium points)? What is the complexity of the process? Can complexity be used to guard against unwanted phenomena? Does complexity of computation prevent realistic implementation of a technique? The practical applications of voting among automated agents are already widespread. Ghosh et al. [6] built a movie recommendation system; a users preferences were represented as agents, and movies to be suggested were selected through agent voting. Candidates in virtual elections have also been beliefs, joint plans [5], and schedules [7]. In fact, to see the generality of the (automated) voting scenario, consider modern web searching. One of the most massive preference aggregation schemes in existence is Googles PageRank algorithm, which can be viewed as a vote among indexed web pages on candidates determined by a user-input search string; winners are ranked (Tennenholtz and Altman [21] consider the axiomatic foundations of ranking systems such as this). In this paper, we consider a topic that has been less studied in the context of automated agent voting, namely power indices. A power index is a measure of the power that a subgroup, or equivalently a voter in a weighted voting environment, has over decisions of a larger group. The Banzhaf power index is one of the most popular measures of voting power, and although it has been used primarily for measuring power in weighted voting games, it is well-defined for any simple coalitional game. We look at some computational aspects of the Banzhaf power index in a specific environment, namely a network flow game. In this game, a coalition of agents wins if it can send a flow of size k from a source vertex s to a target vertex t, with the relative power of each edge reflecting its significance in allowing such a flow. We show that calculating the Banzhaf power index of each agent in this general network flow domain is #P-complete. We also show that for some restricted network flow domains (specifically, of con1 We use the term in its intuitive sense here, but in the social choice literature, preference aggregation and voting are basically synonymous. 335 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS nectivity games on bounded layer graphs), there does exist a polynomial algorithm to calculate the Banzhaf power index of an agent. There are implications in this scenario to real-world networks; for example, the power index might be used to allocate maintenance resources (a more powerful edge being more critical), in order to maintain a given flow of data between two points. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we give some background concerning coalitional games and the Banzhaf power index, and in Section 3 we introduce our specific network flow game. In Section 4 we discuss the Banzhaf power index in network flow games, presenting our complexity result in the general case. In Section 5 we consider a restricted case of the network flow game, and present results. In Section 6 we discuss related work, and we conclude in Section 7. 2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND A coalitional game is composed of a set of n agents, I, and a function mapping any subset (coalition) of the agents to a real value v : 2I → R. In a simple coalitional game, v only gets values of 0 or 1 (v : 2I → {0, 1}). We say a coalition C ⊂ I wins if v(C) = 1, and say it loses if v(C) = 0. We denote the set of all winning coalitions as W(v) = {C ⊂ 2I |v(C) = 1}. An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0. A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game. One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game. Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1]. This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system. However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game. The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})]. Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20]. The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 3. NETWORK FLOW GAMES 3.1 Motivation Consider a communication network, where it is crucial to be able to send a certain amount of information between two sites. Given limited resources to maintain network links, which edges should get those resources? 2 Banzhaf actually considered the percentage of such coalitions out of all winning coalitions. This is called the normalized Banzhaf index. We model this problem by considering a network flow game. The game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain source vertex s and target vertex t. Each agent controls one of the graphs edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its members control. A coalition of agents wins the game if it manages to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses otherwise. To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow. In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target. Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows. The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei. Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target. More precisely, a connectivity game is a network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity, c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1. In such a scenario, the goal of a coalition is to have at least one path from s to t: v(C) = 1 if EC contains a path from s to t; 0 otherwise; Given a network flow game (or a connectivity game), we can compute the power indices of the game. When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4. THE BANZHAF INDEX IN NETWORK FLOW GAMES We now define the problem of calculating the Banzhaf index in the network flow game. DEFINITION 1. NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF: We are given a network flow graph G =< V, E > with a source vertex s and a target vertex t, a capacity function c : E → R, and a target flow value k. We consider the network flow game, as defined above in Section 3. We are given an agent i, controlling the edge ei, and are asked to calculate the Banzhaf index for that agent. In the network 3 When each ordering of edges is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Shapley-Shubik index. 336 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) flow game, let Cei be the set of all subsets of E that contain ei: Cei = {C ⊂ E|ei ∈ C}. In this game, the Banzhaf index of ei is: βi(v) = 1 2|E|−1 E ⊂Cei [v(E ) − v(E \\ {ei})]. Let W(Cei ) be the set of winning subsets of edges in Cei , i.e., the subsets E ∈ Cei where a flow of at least k can be sent from s to t using only the edges in E . The Banzhaf index of ei is the proportion of subsets in W(Cei ) where ei is crucial to maintaining the k-flow. All the edge subsets in W(Cei ) contain ei and are winning, but only for some of them, E ∈ W(Cei ), do we have that v(E \\ {ei}) = 0 (i.e., E is no longer winning if we remove ei). The Banzhaf index of ei is the proportion of such subsets. 4.1 #P-Completeness of Calculating the Banzhaf Index in the Network Flow Game We now show that the general case of NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF is #P-complete, by a reduction from #MATCHING. First, we note that NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF is in #P. There are several polynomial algorithms to calculate the maximal network flow, so it is easy to check if a certain subset of edges E ⊂ E contains ei and allows a flow of at least k from s to t. It is also easy to check if a flow of at least k is no longer possible when we remove ei from E (again, by running a polynomial algorithm for calculating the maximal flow). The Banzhaf index of ei is exactly the number of such subsets E ⊂ E, so NETWORK-FLOWBANZHAF is in #P. To show that NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF is #P-complete, we reduce a #MATCHING problem4 to a NETWORKFLOW-BANZHAF problem. DEFINITION 2. #MATCHING: We are given a bipartite graph G =< U, V, E >, such that |U| = |V | = n, and are asked to count the number of perfect matchings possible in G. 4.2 The Overall Reduction Approach The reduction is done as follows. From the #MATCHING input, G =< U, V, E >, we build two inputs for the NETWORKFLOW-BANZHAF problem. The difference between the answers obtained from the NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF runs is the answer to the #MATCHING problem. Both runs of the NETWORKFLOW-BANZHAF problem are constructed with the same graph G =< V , E >, with the same source vertex s and target vertex t, and with the same edge ef for which to compute the Banzhaf index. They differ only in the target flow value. The first run is with a target flow of k, and the second run is with a target flow of k + . A choice of subset Ec ⊂ E reflects a possible matching in the original graph. G is a subgraph of the constructed G . We identify an edge in G , e ∈ E , with the same edge in G. This edge indicates a particular match between some vertex u ∈ U and another vertex v ∈ V . Thus, if Ec ⊂ E is a subset of edges in G which contains only edges in the subgraph of G, we identify it with a subset of edges in G, or with some candidate of a matching. We say Ec ⊂ E matches some vertex v ∈ V , if Ec contains some edge that connects to v, i.e., for some u ∈ U we have (u, v) ∈ Ec. Ec is a possible matching if it does not match a vertex v ∈ V with more than one vertex in U, i.e., there are not two vertices u1 = u2 in U that both (u1, v) ∈ Ec and (u2, v) ∈ Ec. A perfect matching matches all the vertices in V . If Ec fails to match a vertex in V (the right side of the partition), the maximal possible flow that Ec allows in G is less than k. If it matches all the vertices in V , a flow of k is possible. If it matches 4 This is one of the most well-known #P-complete problems. all the vertices in V , but matches some vertex in V more than once (which means this is not a true matching), a flow of k+ is possible. is chosen so that if a single vertex v ∈ V is unmatched, the maximal possible flow would be less than |V |, even if all the other vertices are matched more than once. In other words, is chosen so that matching several vertices in V more than once can never compensate for not matching some vertex in V , in terms of the maximal possible flow. Thus, when we check the Banzhaf index of ef when the required flow is at least k, we get the number of subsets E ⊂ E that match all the vertices in V at least once. When we check the Banzhaf index of ef with a required flow of at least k+ , we get the number of subsets E ⊂ E that match all the vertices in V at least once, and match at least one vertex v ∈ V more than once. The difference between the two is exactly the number of perfect matchings in G. Therefore, if there existed a polynomial algorithm for NETWORKFLOW-BANZHAF, we could use it to build a polynomial algorithm for #MATCHING, so NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF is #Pcomplete. 4.3 Reduction Details The reduction takes the #MATCHING input, the bipartite graph G =< U, V, E >, where |U| = |V | = k. It then generates a network flow graph G as follows. The graph G is kept as a subgraph of G , and each edge in G is given a capacity of 1. A new source vertex s is added, along with a new vertex t and a new target vertex t. Let = 1 k+1 so that · k < 1. The source s is connected to each of the vertices in U, the left partition of G, with an edge of capacity 1 + . Each of the vertices in V is connected to t with an edge of capacity 1 + . t is connected to t with an edge ef of capacity 1 + . As mentioned above, we perform two runs of NETWORK-FLOWBANZHAF, both checking the Banzhaf index of the edge ef in the flow network G . We denote the network flow game defined on G with target flow k as v(G ,k). The first run is performed on the game with a target flow of k, v(G ,k), returning the index βef (v(G ,k)). The second run is performed on the game with a target flow of k + , v(G ,k+ ), returning the index βef (v(G ,k+ )). The number of perfect matchings in G is the difference between the answers in the two runs, βef (v(G ,k)) − βef (v(G ,k+ )). This is proven in Theorem 5. Figure 1 shows an example of constructing G from G. On the left is the original graph G, and on the right is the constructed network flow graph G . 4.4 Proof of the reduction We now prove that the reduction above is correct. In all of this section, we take the input to the #MATCHING problem to be G =< U, V, E > with |U| = |V | = k, the network flow graph constructed in the reduction to be G =< V , E > with capacities c : E → R as defined in Section 4.3, the edge for which to calculate the Banzhaf index to be ef , and target flow values of k and k + . PROPOSITION 1. Let Ec ⊂ E be a subset of edges that lacks one or more edges of the following: 1. The edges connected to s; 2. The edges connected to t ; 3. The edge ef = (t , t). We call such a subset a missing subset. The maximal flow between s and t using only the edges in the missing subset Ec is less than k. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 337 Figure 1: Reducing #MATCHING to NETWORK-FLOW-BANZHAF PROOF. The graph is a layer graph, with s being the vertex in the first layer, U the vertices in the second layer, V the vertices in the third, t the vertex in the fourth, and t in the fifth. Edges in G only go between consecutive layers. The maximal flow in a layer graph is limited by the total capacity of the edges between every two consecutive layers. If any of the edges between s and U is missing, the flow is limited by (|V | − 1)(1 + ) < k. If any of the edges between V and t is missing, the flow is also limited by (|V | − 1)(1 + ) < k. If the edge ef is missing, there are no edges going to the last layer, and the maximal flow is 0. Since such missing subsets of edges do not affect the Banzhaf index of ef (they add 0 to the sum), from now on we will consider only non-missing subsets. As explained in Section 4.2, we identify the edges in G that were copied from G (the edges between U and V in G ) with their counterparts in G. Each such edge (u, v) ∈ E represents a match between u and v in G. Ec is a perfect matching if it matches every vertex u to a single vertex v and vice versa. PROPOSITION 2. Let Ec ⊂ E be a subset of edges that fails to match some vertex v ∈ V . The maximal flow between s and t using only the edges in the missing subset Ec is less than k. We call such a set sub-matching, and it is not a perfect matching. PROOF. If Ec fails to match some vertex v ∈ V , the maximal flow that can reach the vertices in the V layer is (1+ )(k−1) < k, so this is also the maximal flow that can reach t. PROPOSITION 3. Let Ec ⊂ E be a subset of edges that is a perfect matching in G. Then the maximal flow between s and t using only the edges in Ec is exactly k. PROOF. A flow of k is possible. We send a flow of 1 from s to each of the vertices in U, send a flow of 1 from each vertex u ∈ U to its match v ∈ V , and send a flow of 1 from each v ∈ V to t . t gets a total flow of exactly k, and sends it to t. A flow of more than k is not possible since there are exactly k edges of capacity 1 between the U layer and the V layer, and the maximal flow is limited by the total capacity of the edges between these two consecutive layers. PROPOSITION 4. Let Ec ⊂ E be a subset of edges that contains a perfect matching M ⊂ E in G and at least one more edge ex between some vertex ua ∈ U and va ∈ V . Then the maximal flow between s and t using only the edges in Ec is at least k+ . We call such a set a super-matching, and it is not a perfect matching. PROOF. A flow of k is possible, by using the edges of the perfect match as in Proposition 3. We send a flow of 1 from s to each of the vertices in U, send a flow of 1 from each vertex u ∈ U to its match v ∈ V , and send a flow of 1 from each v ∈ V to t . t gets a total flow of exactly k, and sends it to t. After using the edges of the perfect matching, we send a flow of from s to ua (this is possible since the capacity of the edge (s, ua) is 1 + and we have only used up 1). We then send a flow of from ua to va. This is possible since we have not used this edge at all-it is the edge which is not a part of the perfect matching. We then send a flow of from va to t . Again, this is possible since we have used 1 out of the total capacity of 1 + which that edge has. Now t gets a total flow of k + , and sends it all to t, so we have achieved a total flow of k + . Thus, the maximal possible flow is at least k + . THEOREM 5. Consider a #MATCHING instance G =< U, V, E > reduced to a BANZHAF-NETWORK-FLOW instance G as explained in Section 4.3. Let v(G ,k) be the network flow game defined on G with target flow k, and v(G ,k+ ) be the game defined with a target flow of k+ . Let the resulting index of the first run be βef (v(G ,k)), and βef (v(G ,k+ )) be the resulting index of the second run. Then the number of perfect matchings in G is the difference between the answers in the two runs, βef (v(G ,k)) − βef (v(G ,k+ )). PROOF. Consider the game v(G ,k). According to Proposition 1, in this game, the Banzhaf index of Ef does not count missing subsets Ec ∈ E , since they are losing in this game. According to Proposition 2, it does not count subsets Ec ∈ E that are submatchings, since they are also losing. According to Proposition 3, it adds 1 to the count for each perfect matching, since such subsets allow a flow of k and are winning. According to Proposition 3, it adds 1 to the count for each super-matching, since such subsets allow a flow of k (and more than k) and are winning. Consider the game v(G ,k+ ). Again, according to Proposition 1, in this game the Banzhaf index of Ef does not count missing subsets Ec ∈ E , since they are losing in this game. According to Proposition 2, it does not count subsets Ec ∈ E that are submatchings, since they are also losing. According to Proposition 3, it adds 0 to the count for each perfect matching, since such subsets allow a flow of k but not k + , and are thus losing. According to Proposition 3, it adds 1 to the count for each super-matching, since such subsets allow a flow of k + and are winning. Thus the difference between the two indices, βef (v(G ,k)) − βef (v(G ,k+ )), is exactly the number of perfect matchings in G. We have reduced a #MATCHING problem to a NETWORKFLOW-BANZHAF problem. This means that given a polynomial 338 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) algorithm to calculate the Banzhaf index of an agent in a general network flow game, we can build an algorithm to solve the #MATCHING problem. Thus, the problem of calculating the Banzhaf index of agents in general network flow games is also #P-complete. 5. CALCULATING THE BANZHAF INDEX IN BOUNDED LAYER GRAPH CONNECTIVITY GAMES We here present a polynomial algorithm to calculate the Banzhaf index of an edge in a connectivity game, where the network is a bounded layer graph. This positive result indicates that for some restricted domains of network flow games, it is possible to calculate the Banzhaf index in a reasonable amount of time. DEFINITION 3. A layer graph is a graph G =< V, E >, with source vertex s and target vertex t, where the vertices of the graph are partitioned into n + 1 layers, L0 = {s}, L1, ..., Ln = {t}. The edges run only between consecutive layers. DEFINITION 4. A c-bounded layer graph is a layer graph where the number of vertices in each layer is bounded by some constant number c. Although there is no limit on the number of layers in a bounded layer graph, the structure of such graphs makes it possible to calculate the Banzhaf index of edges in connectivity games on such graphs. The algorithm provided below is indeed polynomial in the number of vertices given that the network is a c-bounded layer graph. However, there is a constant factor to the running time, which is exponential in c. Therefore, this method is only tractable for graphs where the bound c is small. Bounded layer graphs may occur in networks when the nodes are located in several ordered segments, where nodes can be connected only between consecutive segments. Let v be a vertex in layer Li. We say an edge e occurs before v if it connects two vertices in vs layer or a previous layer: e = (u, w) connects vertex u ∈ Lj to vertex w ∈ Lj+1 and j + 1 ≤ i. Let Predv ⊂ E be the subset of edges that occur before v. Consider a subset of these edges, E ⊂ Predv. E may contain a path from s to v, or it may not. We define Pv as the number of subsets E ⊂ Predv that contain a path from s to v. Similarly, let Vi ∈ V be the subset of all the vertices in the same layer Li. Let PredVi ⊂ E be the subset of edges that occur before Vi (all the vertices in Vi are in the same layer, so any edge that occurs before some v ∈ Vi occurs before any other vertex w ∈ Vi). Consider a subset of these edges, E ⊂ PredV . Let Vi(E ) be the subset of vertices in Vi that are reachable from s using only the edges in E : Vi(E ) = {v ∈ Vi|E contains a path from s to v}. We say E ∈ PredV connects exactly the vertices in Si ⊂ Vi if all the vertices in Si are reachable from s using the edges in E but no other vertices in Vi are reachable from s using E , so Vi(E ) = Si. Let V ⊂ Vi be a subset of the vertices in layer Li. We define PV as the number of subsets E ⊂ PredV that connect exactly the vertices in V : PV = |{E ⊂ PredV |Vi(E ) = V }|. LEMMA 1. Let S1, S2 ⊂ Vi where S1 = S2 be two different subsets of vertices in the same layer. Let E , E ⊂ PredVi be two sets of edge subsets, so that E connects exactly the vertices in S1 and E connects exactly the vertices in S2: Vi(E ) = S1 and Vi(E ) = S2. Then E and E do not contain the same edges: E = E . PROOF. If E = E then both sets of edges allow the same paths from s, so Vi(E ) = Vi(E ). Let Si ⊂ Vi be a subset of vertices in layer Li. Let Ei ⊂ E be the set of edges between the vertices in layer Li and layer Li+1. Let E ⊂ Ei be some subset of these edges. We denote by Dests(Si, E) the set of vertices in layer Li+1 that are connected to some vertex in Si by an edge in E: Dests(Si, E) = {v ∈ Vi+1|there exists some w ∈ Si and some e ∈ E that e = (w, v)}. Let Si ⊂ Vi be a subset of vertices in Li and E ⊂ Ei be some subset of the edges between layer Li and layer Li+1. PSi counts the number of edge subsets in PredVi that connect exactly the vertices in Si. Consider such a subset E counted in PSi . E ∪ E is a subset of edges in PredVi+1 that connects exactly to Dest(Si, E). According to Lemma 1, if we iterate over the different Sis in layer Li, the PSi s count different subsets of edges, and thus every expansion using the edges in E is also different. Algorithm 1 calculates Pt. It iterates through the layers, and updates the data for the next layer given the data for the current layer. For each layer Li and every subset of edges in that layer Si ⊂ Vi, it calculates PSi . It does so using the values calculated in the previous layer. The algorithm considers every subset of possible vertices in the current layer, and every possible subset of expanding edges to the next layer, and updates the value of the appropriate subset in the next layer.

There are also at most c2 edges between 2 consecutive layers, and thus at most 2(c2 ) edge subsets between two layers. If the graph contains k layers, the running time of the algorithm is bounded by k·2c ·2(c2 ) . Since c is a constant, this is a polynomial algorithm. Consider the connectivity game on a layer graph G, with a single source vertex s and target vertex t. The Banzhaf index of the edge e is the number of subsets of edges that allow a path between s and t, but do not allow such a path when e is removed (divided by a constant). We can calculate P{t} = P{t}(G) for G using the algorithm to count the number of subsets of edges that allow a path from s to t. We can then remove e from G to obtain the graph G =< V, E \\ {e} >, and calculate P{t} = P{t}(G ). The difference P{t}(G) − P{t}(G ) is the number of subsets of edges that contain a path from s to t but no longer contain such a path when e is removed. The Banzhaf index for e is P{t}(G)−P{t}(G ) 2|E|−1 . Thus, this algorithm allows us to calculate the Banzhaf index on an edge in the connectivity games on bounded layer graphs. The Sixth Intl.

The most popular indices suggested for such measurement are the Banzhaf index [1] and the Shapley-Shubik index [19]. In his seminal paper, Shapley [18] considered coalitional games and the fair allocation of the utility gained by the grand coalition (the coalition of all agents) to its members. The Shapley-Shubik index [19] is the direct application of the Shapley value to simple coalitional games. The Banzhaf index emerged directly from the study of voting in decision-making bodies. The normalized Banzhaf index measures the proportion of coalitions in which a player is a swinger, out of all winning coalitions. This index is similar to the Banzhaf index discussed in Section 1, and is defined as: βi = βi(v) k∈N βk . The Banzhaf index was mathematically analyzed in [3], where it was shown that this normalization lacks certain desirable properties, and the more natural Banzhaf index is introduced. Both the Shapley-Shubik and the Banzhaf indices have been widely studied, and Straffin [20] has shown that each index reflects specific conditions in a voting body. [11] considers these two indices along with several others, and describes the axioms that characterize the different indices. The naive implementation of an algorithm for calculating the Banzhaf index of an agent i enumerates all coalitions containing i. There are 2n−1 such coalitions, so the performance is exponential in the number of agents. [12] contains a survey of algorithms for calculating power indices of weighted majority games. Deng and Papadimitriou [2] show that computing the Shapley value in weighted majority games is #P-complete, using a reduction from KNAPSACK. Since the Shapley value of any simple game has the same value as its Shapley-Shubik index, this shows that calculating the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted majority games is #Pcomplete. Matsui and Matsui [13] have shown that calculating both the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices in weighted voting games is NP-complete. The problem of computing power indices in simple games depends on the chosen representation of the game. Since the number of possible coalitions is exponential in the number of agents, calculating power indices in time polynomial in the number of agents can only be achieved in specific domains. In this paper, we have considered the network flow domain, where a coalition of agents must achieve a flow beyond a certain value. The network flow game we have defined is a simple game. [10, 9] have considered a similar network flow domain, where each agent controls an edge of a network flow graph. However, they introduced a non-simple game, where the value a coalition of agents achieves is the maximal total flow. They have shown that certain families of network flow games and similar games have nonempty cores. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have considered network flow games, where a coalition of agents wins if it manages to send a flow of more than some value k between two vertices. We have assessed the relative power of each agent in this scenario using the Banzhaf index. This power index may be used to decide how to allocate maintenance resources in real-world networks, in order to maximize our ability to maintain a certain flow of information between two sites. Although the Banzhaf index theoretically allows us to measure the power of the agents in the network flow game, we have shown that the problem of calculating the Banzhaf index in this domain in #P-complete. Despite this discouraging result for the general network flow domain, we have also provided a more encouraging result for a restricted domain. In the case of connectivity games (where it is only required for a coalition to contain a path from the source to the destination) played on bounded layer graphs, it is possible to calculate the Banzhaf index of an agent in polynomial time. It remains an open problem to find ways to tractably approximate the Banzhaf index in the general network flow domain. It might also be possible to find other useful restricted domains where it is possible to exactly calculate the Banzhaf index. We have only considered the complexity of calculating the Banzhaf index; it remains an open problem to find the complexity of calculating the Shapley-Shubik or other indices in the network flow domain. Finally, we believe that there are many additional interesting domains other than weighted voting games and network flow games, and it would be worthwhile to investigate the complexity of calculating the Banzhaf index or other power indices in such domains. 8.

    "original_translation": "Calculación del índice de potencia Banzhaf en juegos de flujo de red Yoram Bachrach Jeffrey S. Rosenschein Escuela de Ingeniería e Informática La Universidad Hebrea de Jerusalén, Israel {Yori, Jeff}@cs.huji.ac.il La agregación de preferencias abstractas se usa en variedad de variedad de la variedad deAplicaciones múltiples y, como resultado, la teoría de votación se ha convertido en un tema importante en la investigación de sistemas múltiples. Sin embargo, los índices de potencia (que reflejan cuánto poder real tiene un votante en un sistema de votación ponderado) han recibido relativamente poca atención, aunque durante mucho tiempo han sido estudiados en ciencias políticas y economía. El índice de potencia Banzhaf es uno de los más populares;También está bien definido para cualquier juego de coalición simple. En este documento, examinamos la complejidad computacional de calcular el índice de potencia Banzhaf dentro de un dominio multiagente particular, un juego de flujo de red. Los agentes controlan los bordes de un gráfico;Una coalición gana si puede enviar un flujo de un tamaño dado desde un vértice de origen a un vértice de destino. La potencia relativa de cada borde/agente refleja su importancia en habilitar dicho flujo, y en las redes del mundo real podrían usarse, por ejemplo, asignar recursos para mantener partes de la red. Mostramos que calcular el índice de potencia Banzhaf de cada agente en este dominio de flujo de red es #P-complete. También mostramos que para algunos dominios de flujo de red restringidos existe un algoritmo polinomial para calcular los índices de potencia Banzhaf de los agentes.

Introducción La teoría de la elección social puede servir como una base apropiada sobre la cual construir aplicaciones multiagentes. Existe una rica literatura sobre el tema de la votación1 de las ciencias políticas, las matemáticas y la economía, con importantes resultados teóricos, y los constructores de agentes automatizados pueden beneficiarse de este trabajo a medida que diseñan sistemas que alcanzan el consenso grupal. De hecho, el interés en la teoría de la economía y la elección social se ha generalizado en toda la informática, porque se reconoce que tiene implicaciones directas en la construcción de sistemas compuestos por múltiples agentes automatizados [16, 4, 22, 17, 14, 15, 15] Lo que distingue el trabajo de informática en estas áreas es su preocupación por los problemas computacionales: ¿cómo se llegan los resultados (por ejemplo, puntos de equilibrio)? ¿Cuál es la complejidad del proceso? ¿Se puede utilizar la complejidad para protegerse contra fenómenos no deseados? ¿La complejidad del cálculo evita la implementación realista de una técnica? Las aplicaciones prácticas de votación entre los agentes automatizados ya están generalizadas. Ghosh et al.[6] construyó un sistema de recomendación de películas;Las preferencias de los usuarios se representaron como agentes, y las películas a sugerir se seleccionaron a través de la votación de agentes. Los candidatos en las elecciones virtuales también han sido creencias, planes conjuntos [5] y horarios [7]. De hecho, para ver la generalidad del escenario de votación (automatizado), considere la búsqueda en la web moderna. Uno de los esquemas de agregación de preferencias más masivos que existen es el algoritmo de PageRank Googles, que puede verse como un voto entre las páginas web indexadas en los candidatos determinados por una cadena de búsqueda de entrada de usuario;Los ganadores están clasificados (Tennenholtz y Altman [21] consideran los cimientos axiomáticos de los sistemas de clasificación como este). En este documento, consideramos un tema que se ha estudiado menos en el contexto de la votación de agentes automatizados, a saber, los índices de energía. Un índice de potencia es una medida del poder que un subgrupo, o de manera equivalente un votante en un entorno de votación ponderado, tiene sobre las decisiones de un grupo más grande. El índice de poder Banzhaf es una de las medidas más populares del poder de voto, y aunque se ha utilizado principalmente para medir el poder en los juegos de votación ponderados, está bien definida para cualquier juego de coalición simple. Observamos algunos aspectos computacionales del índice de potencia Banzhaf en un entorno específico, a saber, un juego de flujo de red. En este juego, una coalición de agentes gana si puede enviar un flujo de tamaño K desde un vértice de origen a un vértice T para el objetivo, con la potencia relativa de cada borde que refleja su importancia para permitir tal flujo. Mostramos que calcular el índice de potencia Banzhaf de cada agente en este dominio de flujo de red general es #P-complete. También mostramos que para algunos dominios de flujo de red restringidos (específicamente, de Con1 usamos el término en su sentido intuitivo aquí, pero en la literatura de elección social, la agregación de preferencias y la votación son básicamente sinónimos. 335 978-81-904262-7-7-5(RPS) C 2007 Juegos de nectividad de Ifaamas en gráficos de capa limitadas), existe un algoritmo polinomial para calcular el índice de potencia Banzhaf de un agente. Hay implicaciones en este escenario para las redes del mundo real;Por ejemplo, el índice de energía podría usarse para asignar recursos de mantenimiento (un borde más poderoso es más crítico), para mantener un flujo de datos dado entre dos puntos. El documento procede de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 damos algunos antecedentes sobre los juegos de coalición y el índice de potencia Banzhaf, y en la Sección 3 presentamos nuestro juego de flujo de red específico. En la Sección 4 discutimos el índice de potencia Banzhaf en los juegos de flujo de red, presentando nuestro resultado de complejidad en el caso general. En la Sección 5 consideramos un caso restringido del juego de flujo de red y presentamos resultados. En la Sección 6 discutimos el trabajo relacionado y concluimos en la Sección 7. 2. Antecedentes técnicos Un juego de coalición está compuesto por un conjunto de n agentes, i y una función mapeando cualquier subconjunto (coalición) de los agentes a un valor real V: 2i → R. En un juego de coalición simple, V solo obtiene valores de 0o 1 (V: 2i → {0, 1}). Decimos una coalición c ⊂ i gana si v (c) = 1, y decimos que pierde si v (c) = 0. Denotamos el conjunto de todas las coaliciones ganadoras como w (v) = {c ⊂ 2i | v (c) = 1}. Un agente I es un swinger (o pivote) en una coalición ganadora C si la extracción de los agentes de esa coalición lo convertiría en una coalición perdedora: v (c) = 1, v (c \\ {i}) = 0. Un swing es un par <i, s> tal que el agente I es un swinger en Coalition S. Una pregunta que surge en este contexto es la medición de la influencia que un agente determinado tiene en el resultado de un juego simple. Un enfoque para medir el poder de los agentes individuales en juegos de coalición simples es el índice Banzhaf.2.1 El índice Banzhaf Una interpretación común del poder que posee un agente es la de su probabilidad a priori de tener un papel importante en el juego. Diferentes supuestos sobre la formación de coaliciones y diferentes definiciones de tener un papel importante han causado que los investigadores definan diferentes índices de potencia, uno de los más prominentes es el índice Banzhaf [1]. Este índice se ha utilizado ampliamente, aunque principalmente con el fin de medir el poder individual en un sistema de votación ponderado. Sin embargo, también se puede aplicar fácilmente a cualquier juego de coalición simple. El índice Banzhaf depende del número de coaliciones en las que un agente es un swinger, de todas las coaliciones posibles.2 El índice Banzhaf está dado por β (v) = (β1 (v), ..., βn (v))donde βi (v) = 1 2n - 1 s⊂n | i∈S [v (s) - v (s \\ {i})]. Diferentes modelos probabilísticos en la forma en que se forma una coalición produce diferentes índices de potencia apropiados [20]. El índice de potencia Banzhaf refleja la suposición de que los agentes son independientes en sus elecciones.3. Juegos de flujo de red 3.1 Motivación Considere una red de comunicación, donde es crucial poder enviar una cierta cantidad de información entre dos sitios. Dados los recursos limitados para mantener enlaces de red, ¿qué bordes deberían obtener esos recursos?2 Banzhaf en realidad consideró el porcentaje de tales coaliciones de todas las coaliciones ganadoras. Esto se llama el índice Banzhaf normalizado. Modelamos este problema considerando un juego de flujo de red. El juego consta de agentes en un gráfico de flujo de red, con una determinada fuente de vértices y vértice de destino t.Cada agente controla uno de los bordes de gráficos, y una coalición de agentes controla todos los bordes que controlan sus miembros. Una coalición de agentes gana el juego si logra enviar un flujo de al menos K de Source S a Target T, y pierde lo contrario. Para garantizar que la red sea capaz de mantener el flujo deseado entre S y T, podemos elegir asignar nuestros recursos de mantenimiento limitados a los bordes de acuerdo con su impacto en permitir este flujo. En otras palabras, los recursos podrían dedicarse a los enlaces cuya falla es más probable que perdamos la capacidad de enviar la cantidad de información requerida entre la fuente y el objetivo. Bajo un modelo probabilístico razonable, el índice Banzhaf nos proporciona una medida del impacto que cada borde tiene al permitir que se envíe esta cantidad de información entre los sitios y, por lo tanto, proporciona una base razonable para la asignación de recursos de mantenimiento escasos.3.2 Definición formal formalmente, un juego de flujo de red se define de la siguiente manera. El juego consta de un gráfico de flujo de red G = <V, E>, con capacidades en los bordes C: E → R, un vértice de origen, un vértice de destino y un conjunto I de agentes, donde el agente I controla el bordeei. Dada una coalición c, que controla los bordes ec = {ei | i ∈ C}, podemos verificar si la coalición permite un flujo de k de s a t.Definimos el simple juego de coalición de flujo de red como el juego donde la coalición gana si permite dicho flujo y pierde lo contrario: v (c) = 1 si EC permite un flujo de k de s a t;0 en lo contrario;Una versión simplificada del juego de flujo de red es el juego de conectividad;En un juego de conectividad, una coalición quiere tener algún camino de origen a objetivo. Más precisamente, un juego de conectividad es un juego de flujo de red donde cada uno de los bordes tiene una capacidad idéntica, c (e) = 1, y el valor del flujo de destino es k = 1. En tal escenario, el objetivo de una coalición es tener al menos un camino de S a T: V (C) = 1 si CE contiene una ruta de S a T;0 en lo contrario;Dado un juego de flujo de red (o un juego de conectividad), podemos calcular los índices de potencia del juego. Cuando se elige una coalición de bordes al azar, y cada coalición es equipable, el índice apropiado es el índice Banzhaf.3 Podemos usar el valor Banzhaf de un agente i ∈ I (o el borde que controla, ei), βei (V (V (V (V (V (V (V) = βi (v), para medir su impacto en permitir un flujo dado entre S y T.4. El índice Banzhaf en los juegos de flujo de red ahora definimos el problema de calcular el índice Banzhaf en el juego de flujo de red. Definición 1. Network-Flow-Banzhaf: se nos da un gráfico de flujo de red G = <V, e> con un vértice de origen y un vértice de destino T, una función de capacidad C: E → R, y un valor de flujo de destino k.Consideramos el juego de flujo de red, como se define anteriormente en la Sección 3. Se nos da un agente I, que controla el borde EI, y se les pide que calculemos el índice Banzhaf para ese agente. En la red 3, cuando cada pedido de bordes es equipable, el índice apropiado es el índice Shapley-Shubik.336 El sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y el juego de flujo de sistemas múltiples (AAMAS 07), deje que CEI sea el conjunto de todos los subconjuntos de E que contienen ei: cei = {c ⊂ e | ei ∈ C}. En este juego, el índice Banzhaf de EI es: βi (v) = 1 2 | e | −1 e ⊂cei [v (e) - v (e \\ {ei})]. Sea W (CEI) el conjunto de subconjuntos ganadores de bordes en CEI, es decir, los subconjuntos e ∈ Cei donde se puede enviar un flujo de al menos k de S a t usando solo los bordes en e. El índice Banzhaf de EI es la proporción de subconjuntos en W (CEI) donde EI es crucial para mantener el flujo K. Todos los subconjuntos de borde en W (CEI) contienen ei y están ganando, pero solo para algunos de ellos, e ∈ W (CEI), tenemos que v (e \\ {ei}) = 0 (es decir, e ya no esganando si eliminamos EI). El índice Banzhaf de EI es la proporción de dichos subconjuntos.4.1 #P-COMPLETIDAD de calcular el índice Banzhaf en el juego de flujo de red ahora mostramos que el caso general de red-flujo de red-banzhaf es #P-completado, mediante una reducción de #matching. Primero, observamos que Network-Flow-Banzhaf está en #P.Existen varios algoritmos polinomiales para calcular el flujo de red máximo, por lo que es fácil verificar si un cierto subconjunto de bordes e ⊂ e contiene EI y permite un flujo de al menos k de s a t.También es fácil verificar si un flujo de al menos K ya no es posible cuando eliminamos EI de E (nuevamente, ejecutando un algoritmo polinomial para calcular el flujo máximo). El índice Banzhaf de EI es exactamente el número de tales subconjuntos e ⊂ E, por lo que la red-flujo de nube está en #P.Para mostrar que Network-Flow-Banzhaf es #P-Complete, reducimos un problema #Caltado4 a un problema de red de flujo de red. Definición 2. #matching: se nos da un gráfico bipartito g = <u, v, e>, tal que | u |= | V |= n, y se les pide que cuenten el número de coincidencias perfectas posibles en G. 4.2 El enfoque de reducción general La reducción se realiza de la siguiente manera. Desde la entrada #matching, g = <u, v, e>, construimos dos entradas para el problema NetworkFlow-Banzhaf. La diferencia entre las respuestas obtenidas de las ejecuciones de red de flujo de red de red es la respuesta al problema de #matching. Ambas ejecuciones del problema NetworkFlow-Banzhaf se construyen con el mismo gráfico G = <V, E>, con el mismo vértice de la fuente y el vértice Target T, y con el mismo borde EF para el cual calcular el índice Banzhaf. Difieren solo en el valor del flujo objetivo. La primera ejecución es con un flujo objetivo de K, y la segunda ejecución es con un flujo objetivo de K +. Una elección de la EC de subconjunto refleja una posible coincidencia en el gráfico original. G es un subgrafio de la construcción G. Identificamos un borde en g, e ∈ E, con el mismo borde en G. Este borde indica una coincidencia particular entre algún vértice u ∈ U y otro vértice v ∈ V. Por lo tanto, si EC ⊂ E es un subconjunto de bordes en G que contiene solo bordes en el subgrafio de G, lo identificamos con un subconjunto de bordes en G, o con algún candidato de una coincidencia. Decimos que la EC ⊂ e coincide con algunos vértices v ∈ V, si EC contiene algún borde que se conecta a V, es decir, para algunos u ∈ U tenemos (u, v) ∈ EC. La CE es una posible coincidencia si no coincide con un vértice v ∈ V con más de un vértice en u, es decir, no hay dos vértices u1 = u2 en u que ambos (u1, v) ∈ EC y (u2, v)∈ EC. Una combinación perfecta coincide con todos los vértices en v. Si la CE no coincide con un vértice en V (el lado derecho de la partición), el flujo máximo posible que EC permite en G es inferior a k.Si coincide con todos los vértices en V, es posible un flujo de k. Si coincide con 4, este es uno de los problemas de combate #P más conocidos.Todos los vértices en V, pero coinciden con algún vértice en V más de una vez (lo que significa que esta no es una verdadera coincidencia), es posible un flujo de K+.se elige para que si un solo vértice v ∈ V no se comparta, el flujo máximo posible sería menor que | V |, incluso si todos los demás vértices coincidan más de una vez. En otras palabras, se elige para que coincida con varios vértices en V más de una vez nunca pueda compensar por no coincidir con algún vértice en V, en términos del flujo máximo posible. Por lo tanto, cuando verificamos el índice Banzhaf de EF cuando el flujo requerido es al menos k, obtenemos el número de subconjuntos que coinciden con todos los vértices en V al menos una vez. Cuando verificamos el índice Banzhaf de EF con un flujo requerido de al menos K+, obtenemos el número de subconjuntos e ⊂ e que coinciden con todos los vértices en V al menos una vez, y coinciden al menos un vértice v ∈ V más de una vez. La diferencia entre los dos es exactamente el número de coincidencias perfectas en G. Por lo tanto, si existiera un algoritmo polinomial para NetworkFlow-Banzhaf, podríamos usarlo para construir un algoritmo polinomial para #matching, por lo que Network-Flow-Banzhaf es #Pcomplete.4.3 Detalles de reducción La reducción toma la entrada #matching, el gráfico bipartito g = <u, v, e>, donde | u |= | V |= k.Luego genera un gráfico de flujo de red G de la siguiente manera. El gráfico G se mantiene como un subgrafio de G, y cada borde en G tiene una capacidad de 1. Se agrega una nueva fuente de vértices S, junto con un nuevo vértice T y un nuevo vértice de destino.Let = 1 k+1 para que · k <1. La fuente S está conectada a cada uno de los vértices en U, la partición izquierda de G, con un borde de capacidad 1 +. Cada uno de los vértices en V está conectado a T con un borde de capacidad 1 +.T está conectado a t con un borde EF de capacidad 1 +. Como se mencionó anteriormente, realizamos dos ejecuciones de red de red de red, ambos verificando el índice Banzhaf del borde EF en la red de flujo g. Denotamos el juego de flujo de red definido en G con el flujo objetivo K como V (G, K). La primera carrera se realiza en el juego con un flujo objetivo de K, V (G, K), devolviendo el índice βEF (V (G, K)). La segunda carrera se realiza en el juego con un flujo objetivo de K+, V (G, K+), devolviendo el índice βEF (V (G, K+)). El número de coincidencias perfectas en G es la diferencia entre las respuestas en las dos corridas, βEF (V (G, K)) - βEF (V (G, K+)). Esto está probado en el Teorema 5. La Figura 1 muestra un ejemplo de construcción de G de G. a la izquierda está el gráfico original G, y a la derecha está el gráfico de flujo de red construido G.4.4 Prueba de la reducción Ahora probamos que la reducción anterior es correcta. En toda esta sección, llevamos la entrada al problema de #matching para ser g = <u, v, e> con | u |= | V |= k, el gráfico de flujo de red construido en la reducción para ser g = <v, e> con capacidades C: E → R como se define en la Sección 4.3, el borde para calcular el índice Banzhaf para ser EF, y los valores de flujo de destinode K y K +. Proposición 1. Deje que EC ⊂ e sea un subconjunto de bordes que carece de uno o más bordes de los siguientes: 1. Los bordes conectados a S;2. Los bordes conectados a t;3. El borde ef = (t, t). Llamamos a tal subconjunto un subconjunto faltante. El flujo máximo entre S y T usando solo los bordes en el subconjunto de EC faltante es menor que K.El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 337 Figura 1: Reducción de #Ching a prueba de red-flujo de red. El gráfico es un gráfico de capa, siendo S el vértice en la primera capa, u los vértices en la segunda capa, v Los vértices en el tercero, t el vértice en el cuarto y t en el quinto. Los bordes en G solo van entre capas consecutivas. El flujo máximo en un gráfico de capa está limitado por la capacidad total de los bordes entre cada dos capas consecutivas. Si falta alguno de los bordes entre S y U, el flujo está limitado por (| V | - 1) (1 +) <k.Si falta alguno de los bordes entre V y T, el flujo también está limitado por (| V | - 1) (1 +) <k.Si falta el borde EF, no hay bordes que van a la última capa, y el flujo máximo es 0. Dado que tales subconjuntos de bordes faltantes no afectan el índice Banzhaf de EF (agregan 0 a la suma), a partir de ahora consideraremos solo subconjuntos no falsos. Como se explica en la Sección 4.2, identificamos los bordes en G que se copiaron de G (los bordes entre U y V en G) con sus contrapartes en G. cada uno de estos borde (U, V) ∈ E representa una coincidencia entre U y VEn G. EC es una coincidencia perfecta si coincide con cada vértice u con un solo vértice V y viceversa. Proposición 2. Deje que EC ⊂ e sea un subconjunto de bordes que no coincide con algún vértice v ∈ V. El flujo máximo entre S y T usando solo los bordes en el subconjunto de EC faltante es menor que K.Llamamos a un submarcado así, y no es una coincidencia perfecta. PRUEBA. Si la CE no coincide con algún vértice v ∈ V, el flujo máximo que puede alcanzar los vértices en la capa V es (1+) (k - 1) <k, por lo que este es también el flujo máximo que puede alcanzar t.Proposición 3. Deje que la EC sea un subconjunto de bordes que es una coincidencia perfecta en G. Entonces el flujo máximo entre S y T usando solo los bordes en la CE es exactamente k.PRUEBA. Es posible un flujo de k. Enviamos un flujo de 1 de s a cada uno de los vértices en u, enviamos un flujo de 1 de cada vértice u ∈ U a su coincidencia v ∈ V, y envía un flujo de 1 de cada v ∈ V a t.T obtiene un flujo total de exactamente k y lo envía a t.No es posible un flujo de más de K ya que hay exactamente K bordes de la capacidad 1 entre la capa U y la capa V, y el flujo máximo está limitado por la capacidad total de los bordes entre estas dos capas consecutivas. Proposición 4. Deje que EC ⊂ E sea un subconjunto de bordes que contiene una coincidencia perfecta M ⊂ E en G y al menos un borde más ex entre algún vértice Ua ∈ U y Va ∈ V. Entonces el flujo máximo entre S y T usando solo los bordes en la CE es al menos K+. Llamamos a tal conjunto un súper coincidente, y no es una coincidencia perfecta. PRUEBA. Es posible un flujo de K, utilizando los bordes de la combinación perfecta como en la Propuesta 3. Enviamos un flujo de 1 de s a cada uno de los vértices en u, enviamos un flujo de 1 de cada vértice u ∈ U a su coincidencia v ∈ V, y envía un flujo de 1 de cada v ∈ V a t.T obtiene un flujo total de exactamente k y lo envía a t.Después de usar los bordes de la coincidencia perfecta, enviamos un flujo de S a UA (esto es posible ya que la capacidad del borde (S, UA) es 1 + y solo hemos usado 1). Luego enviamos un flujo de UA a VA. Esto es posible ya que no hemos usado este borde en todo, es el borde que no es parte de la coincidencia perfecta. Luego enviamos un flujo de VA a t. Nuevamente, esto es posible ya que hemos usado 1 de la capacidad total de 1 + que tiene ese borde. Ahora T obtiene un flujo total de K +, y lo envía todo a T, por lo que hemos logrado un flujo total de K +. Por lo tanto, el flujo máximo posible es al menos K +. Teorema 5. Considere una instancia de #matching g = <u, v, e> reducida a una instancia de flujo de network banzhaf como se explica en la sección 4.3. Sea V (G, K) el juego de flujo de red definido en G con el flujo objetivo K, y V (G, K+) sea el juego definido con un flujo objetivo de K+. Deje que el índice resultante de la primera ejecución sea βEF (v (g, k)), y βEF (v (g, k+)) sea el índice resultante de la segunda ejecución. Entonces, el número de coincidencias perfectas en G es la diferencia entre las respuestas en las dos corridas, βEF (V (G, K)) - βEF (V (G, K+)). PRUEBA. Considere el Juego V (G, K). Según la Propuesta 1, en este juego, el índice Banzhaf de EF no cuenta con los subconjuntos faltantes EC ∈ E, ya que están perdiendo en este juego. Según la Proposición 2, no cuenta los subconjuntos EC ∈ E que son submatchings, ya que también están perdiendo. Según la Proposición 3, agrega 1 al recuento para cada coincidencia perfecta, ya que dichos subconjuntos permiten un flujo de k y están ganando. Según la Proposición 3, agrega 1 al recuento para cada súper coincidencia, ya que dichos subconjuntos permiten un flujo de K (y más que K) y están ganando. Considere el Juego V (G, K+). Nuevamente, según la Propuesta 1, en este juego el índice Banzhaf de EF no cuenta con los subconjuntos faltantes Ec ∈ E, ya que están perdiendo en este juego. Según la Proposición 2, no cuenta los subconjuntos EC ∈ E que son submatchings, ya que también están perdiendo. Según la Proposición 3, agrega 0 al recuento para cada coincidencia perfecta, ya que dichos subconjuntos permiten un flujo de K pero no K +, y así están perdiendo. Según la Proposición 3, agrega 1 al recuento para cada súper coincidencia, ya que dichos subconjuntos permiten un flujo de K + y están ganando. Por lo tanto, la diferencia entre los dos índices, βEF (v (g, k))-βEF (v (g, k+)), es exactamente el número de coincidencias perfectas en G. Hemos reducido un problema de ##Catching a una red de flujo de redproblema. Esto significa que dado un polinomio 338 el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y el algoritmo de sistemas múltiples (AAMAS 07) para calcular el índice BanzHAF de un agente en un juego de flujo de red general, podemos construir un algoritmo para resolver el problema de #matching. Por lo tanto, el problema de calcular el índice Banzhaf de agentes en los juegos de flujo de red general también es #P-COMPLETO.5. Calculando el índice Banzhaf en juegos de conectividad de gráficos de capa limitada aquí presentamos un algoritmo polinomial para calcular el índice Banzhaf de un borde en un juego de conectividad, donde la red es un gráfico de capa limitada. Este resultado positivo indica que para algunos dominios restringidos de los juegos de flujo de red, es posible calcular el índice Banzhaf en un tiempo razonable. Definición 3. Un gráfico de capa es un gráfico g = <v, e>, con vértice de origen y vértice de destino T, donde los vértices del gráfico se dividen en capas n + 1, l0 = {s}, l1, ..., ln= {t}. Los bordes solo funcionan entre capas consecutivas. Definición 4. Un gráfico de capa unida a C es un gráfico de capa donde el número de vértices en cada capa está limitado por algún número constante c.Aunque no hay límite en el número de capas en un gráfico de capas limitadas, la estructura de tales gráficos permite calcular el índice Banzhaf de bordes en juegos de conectividad en tales gráficos. El algoritmo que se proporciona a continuación es de hecho polinomio en el número de vértices dado que la red es un gráfico de capa de C. Sin embargo, hay un factor constante en el tiempo de ejecución, que es exponencial en c.Por lo tanto, este método solo es manejable para gráficos donde el C Bound C es pequeño. Los gráficos de capa limitados pueden ocurrir en las redes cuando los nodos se encuentran en varios segmentos ordenados, donde los nodos solo se pueden conectar entre segmentos consecutivos. Sea V un vértice en la capa LI. Decimos que un borde E ocurre antes de V si conecta dos vértices en VS Capa o una capa anterior: E = (U, W) conecta el vértice u ∈ Lj a Vértice w ∈ Lj + 1 y J + 1 ≤ i. Deje que Predv ⊂ e sea el subconjunto de bordes que ocurren antes de v. Considere un subconjunto de estos bordes, E ⊂ Predv. E puede contener una ruta de S a V, o no. Definimos PV como el número de subconjuntos E ⊂ PredV que contienen una ruta de S a V Deje que Predvi ⊂ e sea el subconjunto de bordes que ocurren antes de VI (todos los vértices en VI están en la misma capa, por lo que cualquier borde que ocurra antes de que se produzca vi vi antes de cualquier otro vértice w ∈ Vi). Considere un subconjunto de estos bordes, E ⊂ Predv. Sea vi (e) el subconjunto de vértices en VI que se pueden accesibles de S usando solo los bordes en E: Vi (E) = {V ∈ Vi | E contiene una ruta de S a V}. Decimos que E ∈ PredV conecta exactamente los vértices en Si ⊂ VI si todos los vértices en Si son accesibles desde S usando los bordes en E, pero no se pueden accesibles otros vértices en VI de S, por lo que VI (E) = Si. Deje que V ⊂ VI sea un subconjunto de los vértices en la capa LI. Definimos PV como el número de subconjuntos E ⊂ PredV que conectan exactamente los vértices en V: PV = | {E ⊂ Predv | Vi (E) = V} |. Lema 1. Sea S1, S2 ⊂ VI donde S1 = S2 sean dos subconjuntos diferentes de vértices en la misma capa. Sea E, E ⊂ Predvi dos conjuntos de subconjuntos de borde, de modo que E conecta exactamente los vértices en S1 y E conecta exactamente los vértices en S2: VI (E) = S1 y VI (E) = S2. Entonces E y E no contienen los mismos bordes: E = E. PRUEBA. Si E = E, ambos conjuntos de bordes permiten las mismas rutas de S, por lo que vi (e) = vi (e). Deje que Si ⊂ VI sea un subconjunto de vértices en la capa LI. Deje que Ei ⊂ e sea el conjunto de bordes entre los vértices en la capa LI y la capa LI+1. Sea e ⊂ ei un subconjunto de estos bordes. Denotamos por Dests (Si, E) el conjunto de vértices en la capa LI+1 que están conectados a algún vértice en Si por un borde en E: Dests (Si, E) = {V ∈ Vi+1 | Existe algunos w∈ Si y algunos e ∈ E que e = (W, V)}. Deje que Si ⊂ VI sea un subconjunto de vértices en Li y E ⊂ ei, un subconjunto de los bordes entre la capa LI y la capa LI+1. PSI cuenta el número de subconjuntos de borde en PredVI que conectan exactamente los vértices en SI. Considere tal subconjunto e contado en PSI. E ∪ E es un subconjunto de bordes en PredVI+1 que se conecta exactamente a Dest (SI, E). Según Lemma 1, si iteramos sobre los diferentes SIS en la capa LI, el PSI s cuenta diferentes subconjuntos de bordes y, por lo tanto, cada expansión que usa los bordes en E también es diferente. El algoritmo 1 calcula Pt. Se itera a través de las capas y actualiza los datos para la siguiente capa dados los datos para la capa actual. Para cada capa LI y cada subconjunto de bordes en esa capa si ⊂ VI, calcula PSI. Lo hace usando los valores calculados en la capa anterior. El algoritmo considera cada subconjunto de posibles vértices en la capa actual, y cada subconjunto posible de bordes en expansión a la siguiente capa, y actualiza el valor del subconjunto apropiado en la siguiente capa. Algoritmo 1 1: Procedimiento que conecta-Exactamente subconjuntos (G, V) 2: P {S} ← 1 Inicialización 3: Para todos los demás subconjuntos de vértices s Do Initialization 4: PS ← 0 5: Fin para 6: Para I ← 0a n - 1 iterer a través de las capas 7: para todos los subconjuntos de vértices si en li do 8: para todos los subconjuntos de borde e entre li, li+1 do 9: d ← desestimados (Si, E) subconjunto en li+1 10: PD← PD + PSI 11: Fin para 12: Fin para 13: Fin para 14: Procedimiento final Un gráfico de capa unida a C contiene en la mayoría de los vértices C en cada capa, por lo que para cada capa hay en la mayoría de los 2 ° C diferentes subconjuntos de vértices en los quecapa. También hay como máximo los bordes C2 entre 2 capas consecutivas y, por lo tanto, como máximo 2 (C2) subconjuntos de borde entre dos capas. Si el gráfico contiene K capas, el tiempo de ejecución del algoritmo está limitado por K · 2C · 2 (C2). Como C es una constante, este es un algoritmo polinomial. Considere el juego de conectividad en un gráfico de capa G, con una sola fuente de vértices S y vértice de destino T.El índice Banzhaf del borde E es el número de subconjuntos de bordes que permiten una ruta entre S y T, pero no permiten tal ruta cuando E se elimina (dividido por una constante). Podemos calcular p {t} = p {t} (g) para g usando el algoritmo para contar el número de subconjuntos de bordes que permiten una ruta de s a t.Luego podemos eliminar E de G para obtener el gráfico g = <v, e \\ {e}>, y calcular p {t} = p {t} (g). La diferencia p {t} (g) - p {t} (g) es el número de subconjuntos de bordes que contienen una ruta de s a t pero ya no contienen dicha ruta cuando se elimina E. El índice Banzhaf para E es p {t} (g) −p {t} (g) 2 | e | −1. Por lo tanto, este algoritmo nos permite calcular el índice Banzhaf en un borde en los juegos de conectividad en gráficos de capa limitadas. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 339 6. El trabajo relacionado que mide el poder de los jugadores individuales en los juegos de coalición se ha estudiado durante muchos años. Los índices más populares sugeridos para dicha medición son el índice Banzhaf [1] y el índice Shapley-Shubik [19]. En su artículo seminal, Shapley [18] consideró juegos de coalición y la asignación justa de la utilidad obtenida por la Gran Coalición (la coalición de todos los agentes) a sus miembros. El índice Shapley-Shubik [19] es la aplicación directa del valor de Shapley a juegos de coalición simples. El índice Banzhaf surgió directamente del estudio de la votación en cuerpos de toma de decisiones. El índice Banzhaf normalizado mide la proporción de coaliciones en las que un jugador es un swinger, de todas las coaliciones ganadoras. Este índice es similar al índice Banzhaf discutido en la Sección 1, y se define como: βi = βi (v) k∈N βK. El índice Banzhaf se analizó matemáticamente en [3], donde se demostró que esta normalización carece de ciertas propiedades deseables, y se introduce el índice Banzhaf más natural. Tanto los índices Shapley-Shubik como los Banzhaf se han estudiado ampliamente, y Straffin [20] ha demostrado que cada índice refleja condiciones específicas en un organismo de votación.[11] considera estos dos índices junto con varios otros y describe los axiomas que caracterizan los diferentes índices. La implementación ingenua de un algoritmo para calcular el índice Banzhaf de un agente que enumera todas las coaliciones que contienen i. Hay 2N - 1 de esas coaliciones, por lo que el rendimiento es exponencial en el número de agentes.[12] contiene una encuesta de algoritmos para calcular los índices de potencia de los juegos mayoritarios ponderados. Deng y Papadimitriou [2] muestran que calcular el valor de Shapley en los juegos mayoritarios ponderados es #P-Completo, utilizando una reducción de la mochila. Dado que el valor Shapley de cualquier juego simple tiene el mismo valor que su índice Shapley-Shubik, esto muestra que calcular el índice Shapley-Shubik en los juegos mayoritarios ponderados es #Pcomplete. Matsui y Matsui [13] han demostrado que calcular los índices Banzhaf y Shapley-Shubik en juegos de votación ponderados es NP Completo. El problema de los índices de potencia informáticos en juegos simples depende de la representación elegida del juego. Dado que el número de posibles coaliciones es exponencial en el número de agentes, calcular los índices de potencia en el polinomio de tiempo en el número de agentes solo se puede lograr en dominios específicos. En este documento, hemos considerado el dominio del flujo de red, donde una coalición de agentes debe lograr un flujo más allá de un cierto valor. El juego de flujo de red que hemos definido es un juego simple.[10, 9] han considerado un dominio de flujo de red similar, donde cada agente controla un borde de un gráfico de flujo de red. Sin embargo, introdujeron un juego no simple, donde el valor que logra una coalición de agentes es el flujo total máximo. Han demostrado que ciertas familias de juegos de flujo de red y juegos similares tienen núcleos no vacíos.7. Conclusiones y direcciones futuras que hemos considerado los juegos de flujo de red, donde una coalición de agentes gana si logra enviar un flujo de más de algún valor K entre dos vértices. Hemos evaluado el poder relativo de cada agente en este escenario utilizando el índice Banzhaf. Este índice de energía puede usarse para decidir cómo asignar recursos de mantenimiento en redes del mundo real, a fin de maximizar nuestra capacidad de mantener un cierto flujo de información entre dos sitios. Aunque el índice Banzhaf teóricamente nos permite medir el poder de los agentes en el juego de flujo de red, hemos demostrado que el problema de calcular el índice Banzhaf en este dominio en #P-Complete. A pesar de este resultado desalentador para el dominio general de flujo de red, también hemos proporcionado un resultado más alentador para un dominio restringido. En el caso de los juegos de conectividad (donde solo se requiere que una coalición contenga una ruta desde el origen hasta el destino) jugado en gráficos de capa limitadas, es posible calcular el índice Banzhaf de un agente en tiempo polinomial. Sigue siendo un problema abierto para encontrar formas de aproximar el índice Banzhaf en el dominio de flujo de red general. También podría ser posible encontrar otros dominios restringidos útiles donde sea posible calcular exactamente el índice Banzhaf. Solo hemos considerado la complejidad de calcular el índice Banzhaf;Sigue siendo un problema abierto para encontrar la complejidad de calcular el Shapley-Shubik u otros índices en el dominio de flujo de red. Finalmente, creemos que hay muchos dominios interesantes adicionales además de los juegos de votación ponderados y los juegos de flujo de red, y valdría la pena investigar la complejidad de calcular el índice Banzhaf u otros índices de potencia en dichos dominios.8.

        "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
        "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
        "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
        "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
        "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
        "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
        "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
        "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",
        "The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 3.",
        "NETWORK FLOW GAMES 3.1 Motivation Consider a communication network, where it is crucial to be able to send a certain amount of information between two sites.",
        "Given limited resources to maintain network links, which edges should get those resources? 2 Banzhaf actually considered the percentage of such coalitions out of all winning coalitions.",
        "This is called the normalized Banzhaf index.",
        "We model this problem by considering a network flow game.",
        "The game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain source vertex s and target vertex t. Each agent controls one of the graphs edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its members control.",
        "A coalition of agents wins the game if it manages to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses otherwise.",
        "To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow.",
        "In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.",
        "Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.",
        "The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.",
        "Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.",
        "More precisely, a connectivity game is a network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity, c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1.",
        "In such a scenario, the goal of a coalition is to have at least one path from s to t: v(C) = 1 if EC contains a path from s to t; 0 otherwise; Given a network flow game (or a connectivity game), we can compute the power indices of the game.",
        "When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4.",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",
                "The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 3.",

                "To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow.",
                "In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.",
                "Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.",
                "The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.",
                "Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.",

                "When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4.",

                "We denote the set of all winning coalitions as W(v) = {C ⊂ 2I |v(C) = 1}.",
                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",
                "The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 3.",

                "The game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain source vertex s and target vertex t. Each agent controls one of the graphs edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its members control.",
                "A coalition of agents wins the game if it manages to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses otherwise.",
                "To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow.",
                "In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.",
                "Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.",
                "The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.",
                "Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.",
                "More precisely, a connectivity game is a network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity, c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1.",

                "When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4.",

                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",

                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "The game consists of agents in a network flow graph, with a certain source vertex s and target vertex t. Each agent controls one of the graphs edges, and a coalition of agents controls all the edges its members control.",
                "A coalition of agents wins the game if it manages to send a flow of at least k from source s to target t, and loses otherwise.",
                "To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow.",
                "In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.",
                "Under a reasonable <br>probabilistic model</br>, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.",
                "The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.",
                "Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.",
                "More precisely, a connectivity game is a network flow game where each of the edges has identical capacity, c(e) = 1, and the target flow value is k = 1.",

                "When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4.",

                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",

                "An agent i is a swinger (or pivot) in a winning coalition C if the agents removal from that coalition would make it a losing coalition: v(C) = 1, v(C \\ {i}) = 0.",
                "A swing is a pair < i, S > such that agent i is a swinger in coalition S. A question that arises in this context is that of measuring the influence a given agent has on the outcome of a simple game.",
                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
                "Different assumptions about the formation of coalitions, and different definitions of having a significant role, have caused researchers to define different power indices, one of the most prominent of which is the Banzhaf index [1].",
                "This index has been widely used, though primarily for the purpose of measuring individual power in a weighted voting system.",
                "However, it can also easily be applied to any simple coalitional game.",
                "The Banzhaf index depends on the number of coalitions in which an agent is a swinger, out of all possible coalitions.2 The Banzhaf index is given by β(v) = (β1(v), ..., βn(v)) where βi(v) = 1 2n−1 S⊂N|i∈S [v(S) − v(S \\ {i})].",
                "Different probabilistic models on the way a coalition is formed yield different appropriate power indices [20].",
                "The Banzhaf power index reflects the assumption that the agents are independent in their choices. 3.",

                "To ensure that the network is capable of maintaining the desired flow between s and t, we may choose to allocate our limited maintenance resources to the edges according to their impact on allowing this flow.",
                "In other words, resources could be devoted to the links whose failure is most likely to cause us to lose the ability to send the required amount of information between the source and target.",
                "Under a reasonable probabilistic model, the Banzhaf index provides us with a measure of the impact each edge has on enabling this amount of information to be sent between the sites, and thus provides a reasonable basis for allocation of scarce maintenance resources. 3.2 Formal Definition Formally, a network flow game is defined as follows.",
                "The game consists of a network flow graph G =< V, E >, with capacities on the edges c : E → R, a source vertex s, a target vertex t, and a set I of agents, where agent i controls the edge ei.",
                "Given a coalition C, which controls the edges EC = {ei|i ∈ C}, we can check whether the coalition allows a flow of k from s to t. We define the simple coalitional game of network flow as the game where the coalition wins if it allows such a flow, and loses otherwise: v(C) = 1 if EC allows a flow of k from s to t; 0 otherwise; A simplified version of the network flow game is the connectivity game; in a connectivity game, a coalition wants to have some path from source to target.",

                "When a coalition of edges is chosen at random, and each coalition is equiprobable, the appropriate index is the Banzhaf index.3 We can use the Banzhaf value of an agent i ∈ I (or the edge it controls, ei), βei (v) = βi(v), to measure its impact on allowing a given flow between s and t. 4.",

                "One approach to measuring the power of individual agents in simple coalitional games is the Banzhaf index. 2.1 The Banzhaf Index A common interpretation of the power an agent possesses is that of its a priori probability of having a significant role in the game.",
