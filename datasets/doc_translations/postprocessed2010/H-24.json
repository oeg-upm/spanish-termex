White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.

INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3]. Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file. These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results. IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax. Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]). However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies. Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces. There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms. De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries. They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search. However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15]. Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted. In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly. We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13]. Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit. Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target. We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success? Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions. A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches. We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2. RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]). There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively. Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs. A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users. These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4]. However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved. It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality. Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs. In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents. It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17]. Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden. This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1]. In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries. Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail. Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms. Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space. Queries created with these techniques can be powerful. However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features. Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25]. This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems. Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone. Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics. In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors. Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired. However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]). Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user. Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16]. In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines. To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period. In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3. DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed. To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006. When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited. This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior. In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs. These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected. We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages. We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study. To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries. In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers. We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation. We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise. To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration. This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail. If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user. The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way. All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited. To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax. We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups. In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4. SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success. The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1. Table 1. Query and result-click features (per user). Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day Avg. Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg. Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating relevant information. Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior. To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section. A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes. More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33]. In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users. The median number of search trails per user was 30. The median number of steps in the trails was 3. All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page. The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails. All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path. A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation. The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2. Table 2. Post-query browsing features (per trail). Feature Meaning Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds) Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds) Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on the trail (in seconds) Num. Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page following the results page to the end of the trail Num. Branches (NB) Average number of branches Num. Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail. Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries. Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%). We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways. In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects. We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents. Table 3. Relevance judgment measures (per trail). Measure Meaning First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and allow us to estimate search success in different ways. We chose multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail). The features described in this section allowed us to analyze important attributes of the search process that must be better understood if we are to support users in their searching. In the next section we present the findings of the analysis. 5. FINDINGS Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating judged-relevant documents. Parametric statistical testing is used, and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05. 5.1 Query and result-click behavior We were interested in comparing the query and result-click behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users. In Table 4 we show the mean average values for each of the seven search features for our users. We use padvanced to denote the percentage of all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e., padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax). The table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%), users who submitted at least one query with operators (≥ 0%), through to users whose queries contained operators at least threequarters of the time (≥ 75%). Table 4. Query and result click features (per user). Feature padvanced 0% > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% QPS .028 .010 .012 .013 .015 QRR .53 .57 .58 .61 .62 QWL 2.02 2.83 3.40 3.66 4.04 QPD 2.01 3.52 2.70 2.66 2.31 ACP 6.83 9.12 10.09 10.17 11.37 CP .57 .51 .47 .47 .47 ASC 87.71 88.16 112.44 102.12 79.13 %Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04% We compared the query and result click features of users who did not use any advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%) in any of their queries with those who used advanced syntax in at least one query (padvanced > 0%). The columns corresponding to these two groups are bolded in Table 4. We performed an independent measures ttest between these groups for each of the features. Since this analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level (α) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features. This correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null hypotheses that are true. All differences between the groups were statistically significant (all t(188403) ≥ 2.81, all p ≤ .002). However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the means were likely to be statistically significant. We applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size for each of the comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user groups. Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: • Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) • Compose longer queries (d = .69) • Click further down the result list (d = .67) • Submit more queries per day (d = .49) • Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) • Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results. Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34]. Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise. As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators. In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero. The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system. We further hypothesized that users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax may be more advanced search engine users. To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced). We incremented padvanced one percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven query and result-click features at each point. The values of the features at four milestones (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75%) are shown in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, as padvanced increases, differences in the features between those using advanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become more substantial. However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced increases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls (Pearsons R = −.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). More advanced users may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information. To study the patterns of relationship among these dependent variables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26]. Table 5 shows the intercorrelation matrix between the features and the percentage of queries with operators (Padvanced). Each cell in the table contains the Pearsons correlation coefficient between the two features for a given row-column pair. Table 5. Intercorrelation matrix (query / result-click features). padv.

Columns 2 - 8 show the inter-correlations between the other features. There are strong positive correlations between some of the features (e.g., the number of words in the query (QWL) and the average probability of clicking on a search result (ACP)). However, there were also fairly strong negative correlations between some features (e.g., the average length of the queries (QWL) and the probability of clicking on a search result (CP)). The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that account for 83.6% of the variance. As is standard practice in factor analysis, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their respective loadings, can be expressed as: Factor A = .98(QRR) + .97(padv) + .97(QPS) + .71(ACP) + .69(QWL) Factor B = .96(CP) + .90(QPD) + .67(ACP) + .52(ASC) Variance in the query and result-click behavior of our advanced search engine users can be expressed using these two constructs. Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.5% of the variance. It appears to represent a very basic dimension of variance that covers query attributes and querying behavior, and suggests a relationship between query properties (length, frequency, complexity, and repetition) and the position of users clicks in the result list. The dimension underlying Factor B accounts for 33.1% of the variance, and describes attributes of result-click behavior, and a strong correlation between result clicks and the number of queries submitted each day. Summary: In this section we have shown that there are marked differences in aspects of the querying and result-clickthrough behaviors of advanced users relative to non-advanced users. We have also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that contain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and clickthrough behaviors become. A factor analysis revealed the presence of two dimensions that adequately characterize variance in the query and result-click features. In the querying dimension query attributes, such as the length and proportion that contain advanced syntax, and querying behavior, such as the number of queries submitted per day both affect result-click position. In addition, in the result-click dimension, it appears that daily querying frequency influences result-click features such as the likelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount of time between result presentation and the search result click. The features used in this section are only interactions with search engines in the form of queries and result clicks. We did not address how users searched for information beyond the result page. In the next section we use the search trails described in Section 4 to analyze the post-query browsing behavior of users. 5.2 Post-query browsing behavior In this section we look at several attributes of the search trails users followed beyond the results page in an attempt to discern whether the use of advanced search syntax can be used as a predictor of aspects of post-query interaction behavior. As we did previously, we first describe the mean average values for each of the browsing features, across all advanced users (i.e. padvanced > 0%), all non-advanced users (i.e., padvanced = 0%), and all users regardless of their estimated search expertise level. We then look at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value of padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to 100%. In Table 6 we present the average values for each of these features for the two groups of users. Also shown are the percentage of search trails (%Trails) and the percentage of users (%Users) used to compute the averages. Table 6. Post-query browsing features (per trail). Feature padvanced 0% > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% Session secs. 701.10 706.21 792.65 903.01 1114.71 Trail secs. 205.39 159.56 156.45 147.91 136.79 Display secs. 36.95 32.94 34.91 33.11 30.67 Num. steps 4.88 4.72 4.40 4.40 4.39 Num. backs 1.20 1.02 1.03 1.03 1.02 Num. branches 1.55 1.51 1.50 1.47 1.44 %Trails 72.14% 27.86% .83% .23% .05% %Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04% As can be seen from Table 6, there are differences in the postquery interaction behaviors of advanced users (padvanced > 0%) relative to that do not use query operators in any of their queries (padvanced = 0%). Once again, the columns of interest in this comparison are bolded. As we did in Section 5.1 for query and result-click behavior, we performed an independent measures ttest between the values reported for each of the post-query browsing features. The results of this test suggest that differences between those that use advanced syntax and those that do not are significant (t(12495029) ≥ 3.09, p ≤ .002, α = .008). Given the sample sizes, all of the differences between means in the two groups were significant. However, we once again applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size. The findings (ranked in descending order based on effect size), show that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: • Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45) • Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38) • Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28) • Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back operation) less often (d = .18) • Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16) It seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style than non-advanced users. They spend less time following search trails and view the documents that lie on those trails for less time. This is in accordance with our earlier proposition that advanced users seem able to discern document relevance in less time. Advanced users also tend to deviate less from a direct path as they search, with fewer revisits to previously-visited pages and less branching during their searching. As we did in the previous section, we increased the padvanced threshold one point at a time. With the exception of number of back operations (NB), the values attributable to each of the features change as padvanced increased. It seems that the differences noted earlier between non-advanced users and those that use any advanced syntax become more significant as padvanced increases. As in the previous section, we conducted a factor analysis of these features and padvanced. Table 7 shows the intercorrelation matrix for all these variables. Table 7. Intercorrelation matrix (post-query browsing). padv SS TS DS NS NB NBA padv 1.00 .977 −.843 −.867 −.395 −.339 −.249 SS 1.00 −.765 −.875 −.374 −.335 −.237 TS 1.00 .948 .387 .281 .250 DS 1.00 .392 .344 .257 NS 1.00 .891 .934 NB 1.00 .918 NBA 1.00 As the proportion of queries containing advanced syntax increases, the values of many of the post-query browsing features decrease. Only the average session time (SS) exhibits a strong positive correlation with padvanced. The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that account for 89.8% of the variance. Once again, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their respective loadings, can be expressed as: Factor A = .95(DS) + .88 (TS) − .91(SS) − .95(padv) Factor B = .99(NBA) + .93(NS) + .91(NB) Variance in the query and result-click behavior of those who use query operators can be expressed using these two constructs. Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.1% of the variance. It appears to represent a very basic temporal dimension that covers timing and percentage of queries with advanced syntax, and suggests a negative relationship between time spent searching and overall session time, and a negative relationship between time spent searching and padvanced. The navigation dimension underlying Factor B accounts for 39.7% of the variance, and describes attributes of post-query navigation, all of which seem to be strongly correlated with each other but not padvanced or timing. Summary: In this section we have shown that advanced users post-query browsing behavior appears more directed than that of non-advanced users. Although their search sessions are longer, advanced users follow fewer search trails during their sessions, (i.e., submit fewer queries), their search trails are shorter, and their trails exhibit fewer deviations or regressions to previously encountered pages. We also showed that as padvanced increases, session time increases (perhaps more advanced users are multitasking between search and other operations), and search interaction becomes more focused, perhaps because advanced users are able target relevant information more effectively, with less need for regressions or deviations in their search trails. As well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and post-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the search process is the attainment of information relevant to the query. In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and non-advanced users in obtaining relevant information. 5.3 Search success As described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments assigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of search success based on documents encountered on search trails. However, the queries for which we have judgments generally did not contain advanced operators. To maximize the likelihood of coverage we removed advanced operators from all queries when retrieving the relevance judgments. The mean average relevance judgment values for each of the four metrics - first, last, average, and maximum - are shown in Table 8 for non-advanced users (0%) and advanced users (> 0%). Table 8.

Not only were these users more successful in their searching, but they were consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in relevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop as padvanced increases). The differences in the four mean average relevance scores for each metric between these two user groups were significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765) ≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125). As we increase the value of padvanced as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all metrics also increases (all Pearsons R ≥ .654), suggesting that more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their searching. The searchers that use advanced operators may have additional skills in locating relevant information, or may know where this information resides based on previous experience.3 Despite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant information (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between groups and within the advanced group were consistent. 3 Although in our logs there was no obvious indication of more revisitation by advanced search engine users. To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus, minus, and site:. In Table 9 we show how these operators were distributed in all queries submitted by these users. Table 9. Distribution of query operators. Feature padvanced > 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% Quotes () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00 Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90 Minus (−) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42 Site: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86 Avg. num. operators 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49 The distribution of the quotes, plus, and minus operators are similar amongst the four levels of padvanced, with quotes being the most popular of the four operators used. However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups. This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator. To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results. We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards. Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query. It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores. More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further. Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users. The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit. Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches. In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success. Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements. We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not. Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19]. There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise. This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers. The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices. Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels. Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10]. The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems. In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29]. Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively. However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome. Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied. Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas. However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from. Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions. One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27]. It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements. However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching. However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success. Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching. These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit. Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do. As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training. Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 Dan@microsoft.com Resumen Una forma de ayudar a ayudarTodos los usuarios de los motores de búsqueda web comerciales tienen más éxito en sus búsquedas es comprender mejor lo que están haciendo esos usuarios con mayor experiencia en búsqueda y usar este conocimiento para beneficiar a todos. En este artículo, estudiamos los registros de interacción de los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda (y aquellos que no están tan avanzados) para comprender mejor cómo buscan estos grupos de usuarios. Los resultados muestran que existen diferencias marcadas en las consultas, los clics de los resultados, la navegación posterior a la Quera y el éxito de búsqueda de los usuarios que clasificamos como avanzados (según su uso de operadores de consultas), en relación con los clasificados como no avanzados. Nuestros hallazgos tienen implicaciones sobre cómo los usuarios avanzados deben ser compatibles durante sus búsquedas, y cómo sus interacciones podrían usarse para ayudar a los buscadores de todos los niveles de experiencia a encontrar información más relevante y aprender estrategias de búsqueda mejoradas. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Búsqueda y recuperación de información]: formulación de consultas, proceso de búsqueda, comentarios de relevancia. Términos generales Experimentación, factores humanos.1. Introducción La formulación de declaraciones de consulta que capturan los aspectos sobresalientes de las necesidades de información y son significativos para los sistemas de recuperación de información (IR) plantea un desafío para muchos buscadores [3]. Los motores de búsqueda web comerciales como Google, Yahoo! Y Windows Live Búsqueda ofrecen a los usuarios la capacidad de mejorar la calidad de sus consultas utilizando operadores de consultas como comillas, más y menos letreros, y modificadores que restringen la búsqueda a un sitio en particular otipo de archivo. Estas técnicas pueden ser útiles para mejorar la precisión de los resultados, aparte de los análisis de registro (por ejemplo, [15] [27]), generalmente han sido pasados por alto por la comunidad de investigación en intentos de mejorar la calidad de los resultados de búsqueda. La investigación de IR generalmente se ha centrado en formas alternativas para que los usuarios especifiquen sus necesidades en lugar de aumentar la absorción de la sintaxis avanzada. La investigación sobre técnicas prácticas para complementar la tecnología de búsqueda existente y los usuarios de soporte se han intensificado en los últimos años (por ejemplo, [18] [34]). Sin embargo, es difícil implementar tales técnicas a gran escala con latencias tolerables. Las consultas típicas enviadas a los motores de búsqueda web toman la forma de una serie de tokens separados por espacios. En general, hay un booleano y operador implícitos entre tokens que restringe los resultados de búsqueda a los documentos que contienen todos los términos de consulta. De Lima y Pedersen [7] investigaron el efecto del análisis, el reconocimiento de frases y la expansión en las consultas de búsqueda web. Mostraron que el reconocimiento automático de frases en consultas puede mejorar la precisión de los resultados en la búsqueda web. Sin embargo, el valor de la sintaxis avanzada para los buscadores típicos generalmente ha sido limitado, ya que la mayoría de los usuarios no conocen la sintaxis avanzada o no entienden cómo usarla [15]. Dado que parece que los operadores pueden ayudar a recuperar documentos relevantes, se justifica una mayor investigación de su uso. En este documento exploramos el uso de operadores de consultas con más detalle y proponemos aplicaciones alternativas que no requieren que todos los usuarios usen sintaxis avanzada explícitamente. Presumimos que los buscadores que usan sintaxis de consulta avanzada demuestran un grado de experiencia en búsqueda que la mayoría de la población de usuarios no;Una afirmación respaldada por investigaciones anteriores [13]. Estudiar el comportamiento de estos usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda puede producir información importante sobre la búsqueda y la navegación de resultados a partir del cual otros pueden beneficiarse. Utilizando registros recopilados de una gran cantidad de usuarios de consentimiento, investigamos las diferencias entre el comportamiento de búsqueda de aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada y aquellos que no, y diferencias en la información que se dirigen a esos usuarios. Estamos interesados en responder tres preguntas de investigación: (i) ¿Existe una relación entre el uso de sintaxis avanzada y otras características de una búsqueda?(ii) ¿Existe una relación entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y los comportamientos de navegación posteriores a la quiry?(iii) ¿Existe una relación entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y las medidas del éxito de la búsqueda? A través de un estudio y análisis experimentales, ofrecemos respuestas potenciales para cada una de estas preguntas. Una relación entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y cualquiera de estas características podría admitir el diseño de sistemas adaptados a los usuarios avanzados de los motores de búsqueda, o usar interacciones de usuarios avanzados para ayudar a los usuarios no avanzados a tener más éxito en sus búsquedas. Describimos el trabajo relacionado en la Sección 2, los datos que utilizamos en este estudio basado en registros en la Sección 3, las características de búsqueda en las que enfocamos nuestro análisis en la Sección 4 y los resultados de este análisis en la Sección 5. En la Sección 6 discutimos las implicaciones de esta investigación, y concluimos en la Sección 7. 2. Factores de trabajo relacionados, como la falta de conocimiento de dominio, la mala comprensión de la recopilación de documentos que se busca y una necesidad de información mal desarrollada puede influir en la calidad de las consultas que los usuarios presentan a los sistemas IR ([24], [28]). Ha habido una variedad de investigaciones sobre diferentes formas de ayudar a los usuarios a especificar sus necesidades de información de manera más efectiva. Belkin et al.[4] Experimentó al proporcionar espacio adicional para que los usuarios escriban una descripción más detallada de sus necesidades de información. Kelly et al. Intentó un enfoque similar.[18], quienes utilizaron formularios de aclaración para obtener información adicional sobre el contexto de búsqueda de los usuarios. Se ha demostrado que estos enfoques son efectivos en los sistemas de recuperación del mejor partido, donde las consultas más largas generalmente conducen a resultados de búsqueda más relevantes [4]. Sin embargo, en la búsqueda web, donde muchos de los sistemas se basan en un modelo de recuperación booleano extendido, las consultas más largas en realidad pueden dañar el rendimiento de la recuperación, lo que lleva a una pequeña cantidad de resultados potencialmente irrelevantes que se recuperan. No es simplemente suficiente solicitar más información de los usuarios;Esta información debe ser de mejor calidad. Comentarios de relevancia (RF) [22] y la expansión de consultas interactivas [9] son técnicas populares que se han utilizado para mejorar la calidad de la información que los usuarios proporcionan a los sistemas IR con respecto a sus necesidades de información. En el caso de RF, el usuario presenta al sistema ejemplos de información relevante que luego se utilizan para formular una consulta mejorada o recuperar un nuevo conjunto de documentos. Ha demostrado ser difícil lograr que los usuarios usen RF en el dominio web debido a la dificultad para transmitir el significado y el beneficio de RF a los usuarios típicos [17]. Las sugerencias de consulta ofrecidas en función de los registros de consultas tienen el potencial de mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación con una carga de usuario limitada. Este enfoque se limita a volver a ejecutar consultas populares, y los buscadores a menudo ignoran las sugerencias que se les presentan [1]. Además, ambas técnicas no ayudan a los usuarios a aprender a producir consultas más efectivas. La mayoría de los motores de búsqueda comercial proporcionan una sintaxis de consulta avanzada que permite a los usuarios especificar sus necesidades de información con más detalle. Los modificadores de consulta como + (más), - (menos) y (citas dobles) pueden usarse para enfatizar, enfatizar y los términos de consulta grupal. Los operadores booleanos (y, o, y no) pueden unir términos y frases, y modificadores como el sitio: y el enlace: se pueden usar para restringir el espacio de búsqueda. Las consultas creadas con estas técnicas pueden ser poderosas. Sin embargo, esta funcionalidad a menudo está oculta a la vista inmediata del buscador, y a menos que conozca la sintaxis, debe usar campos de texto, menús desplegables y cuadros combinados disponibles a través de una interfaz de búsqueda avanzada dedicada para acceder a estas características. El análisis basado en log de las interacciones de los usuarios con los motores de búsqueda Excite y Altavista ha demostrado que solo el 10-20% de las consultas contenían cualquier sintaxis avanzada [14] [25]. Este análisis puede ser una forma útil de capturar las características de los usuarios que interactúan con los sistemas IR. La investigación en modelado de usuarios [6] y personalización [30] ha demostrado que recopilar más información sobre los usuarios puede mejorar la efectividad de las búsquedas, pero requiere más información sobre los usuarios de lo que generalmente está disponible solo con los registros de interacción. A menos que se combine con una técnica cualitativa, como un cuestionario posterior a la sesión [23], puede ser difícil asociar las interacciones con las características del usuario. En nuestro estudio, conjeturamos que, dada la dificultad de ubicar las características de búsqueda avanzadas dentro de la interfaz de búsqueda típica, y los posibles problemas para comprender la sintaxis, aquellos usuarios que usan sintaxis avanzada representan regularmente una clase distinta de buscadores que exhibirán otros comportamientos de búsqueda comunes. Otros estudios de los comportamientos de búsqueda de buscadores avanzados han intentado comprender mejor el conocimiento estratégico que han adquirido. Sin embargo, tales estudios generalmente tienen un tamaño limitado (por ejemplo, [13] [19]) o se centran en la experiencia en el dominio en áreas como la atención médica o el comercio electrónico (por ejemplo, [5]). No obstante, pueden dar una visión valiosa sobre los comportamientos de los usuarios con dominio, sistema o experiencia en búsqueda que excede la del usuario promedio. La consulta del comportamiento en particular se ha estudiado ampliamente para comprender mejor a los usuarios [31] y admitir a otros usuarios [16]. En este artículo, estudiamos otras características de búsqueda de usuarios de sintaxis avanzada en un intento por determinar si hay algo diferente en cómo buscan estos usuarios de motores de búsqueda y si sus búsquedas pueden usarse para beneficiar a aquellos que no utilizan las características avanzadas.de motores de búsqueda. Para hacer esto, utilizamos registros de interacción reunidos de un gran conjunto de usuarios de consentimiento durante un período prolongado. En la siguiente sección describimos los datos que usamos para estudiar el comportamiento de los usuarios que usan sintaxis avanzada, en relación con aquellos que no usan esta sintaxis.3. Datos para realizar este estudio requerimos una descripción del comportamiento de consulta y navegación de muchos buscadores, preferiblemente durante un período de tiempo para permitir que se analicen los patrones en el comportamiento del usuario. Para obtener estos datos, minamos los registros de interacción de los usuarios web de consentimiento durante un período de 13 semanas, de enero a abril de 2006. Al descargar una aplicación del lado del cliente de Partner, los usuarios fueron invitados a consentir su interacción con las páginas web que se registran de forma anónima (con un identificador único asignado a cada usuario) y se utilizaron para mejorar el rendimiento de los sistemas futuros.1 La información contenida en estosLas entradas de registro incluían un identificador único para el usuario, una marca de tiempo para cada vista de página, un identificador único de ventana del navegador (para resolver ambigüedades para determinar qué navegador se vio una página) y la URL de la página web visitada. Esto nos proporcionó datos suficientes sobre el comportamiento de consulta (desde la interacción con los motores de búsqueda) y el comportamiento de navegación (desde la interacción con las páginas que siguen una búsqueda) para investigar más ampliamente el comportamiento de búsqueda. Además de los datos recopilados durante el curso de este estudio, también tuvimos juicios de relevancia de los documentos que los usuarios examinaron para 10,680 declaraciones de consulta únicas presentes en los registros de interacción. Estos juicios fueron asignados en una escala de seis puntos por jueces humanos capacitados en el momento en que se recopilaron los datos. Utilizamos estos juicios en este análisis para evaluar la relevancia de los usuarios de sitios visitados en su rastro de navegación lejos de las páginas de resultados de búsqueda. Estudiamos los registros de interacción de 586,029 usuarios únicos, que enviaron millones de consultas a tres motores de búsqueda populares GuinOogle, Yahoo!, Y MSN Search, durante las 13 semanas de duración del estudio. Para limitar el efecto del sesgo del motor de búsqueda, utilizamos cuatro operadores comunes a los tres motores de búsqueda: + (más), - (menos), (cotizaciones dobles) y el sitio: (para restringir la búsqueda a un dominio o página web)como sintaxis avanzada.El 1.12% de las consultas presentadas contenían al menos uno de estos cuatro operadores.51,080 (8.72%) de los usuarios usaron operadores de consultas en cualquiera de sus consultas. En el resto de este documento, nos referiremos a estos usuarios como buscadores avanzados. Reconocemos que la relación directa entre el uso de sintaxis de consulta y la experiencia en búsqueda solo se ha estudiado 1, vale la pena señalar que si los usuarios no proporcionaron su consentimiento, entonces su interacción no se registró y analizó en este estudio.(y mostrado) en algunos estudios (por ejemplo, [13]), pero creemos que este es un criterio razonable para una investigación basada en log. Conjeturamos que estos buscadores avanzados poseen un alto nivel de experiencia en búsqueda, y mostrarán más adelante en el documento que demuestran características de comportamiento consistentes con la experiencia en búsqueda. Para manejar a los potenciales usuarios atípicos que pueden sesgar nuestro análisis de datos, eliminamos a los usuarios que enviaron menos de 50 consultas en la duración de Studys de 13 semanas. Esto nos dejó con 188,405 usuarios, 37,795 (20.1%) usuarios avanzados y 150,610 (79.9%) usuarios no avanzados, cuyas interacciones estudiamos con más detalle. Si surgen diferencias significativas entre estos grupos, es concebible que estas interacciones puedan usarse para clasificar automáticamente a los usuarios y ajustar una interfaz de sistemas de búsqueda y una ponderación de resultados para que coincidan mejor con el usuario actual. La privacidad de nuestros voluntarios se mantuvo durante todo el curso del estudio: no se obtuvo información personal sobre ellos, a los participantes se les asignó un identificador anónimo único que no se remonta a ellos, y no hicimos ningún intento de identificar un usuario en particular oEstudie el comportamiento individual de cualquier manera. Todos los hallazgos se agregaron en múltiples usuarios, y no se obtuvo información que no sea el consentimiento para el registro. Para obtener más información sobre estos usuarios, estudiamos si aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada exhibieron otros comportamientos de búsqueda que no se observaron en aquellos que no usaron esta sintaxis. Nos centramos en la consulta, la navegación y el éxito general de la búsqueda para comparar los grupos de usuarios. En la siguiente sección describimos con más detalle las características de búsqueda que utilizamos.4. Características de búsqueda que elegimos elegir características que describieran una variedad de aspectos del proceso de búsqueda: consultas, clics de resultados, navegación posterior a la quirada y éxito de búsqueda. La consulta y las características de consulta que elegimos examinar se describen con más detalle en la Tabla 1. Tabla 1. Consulta y características de clic de resultado (por usuario).

Por lo tanto, además de estas características, también estudiamos algunos aspectos relevantes del comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Cuter. Para hacer esto, extrajimos senderos de búsqueda de los registros de interacción descritos en la sección anterior. Un rastro de búsqueda es una serie de páginas web visitadas conectadas a través de un sendero de hipervínculo, iniciado con una página de resultados de búsqueda y terminando en uno de los siguientes eventos: navegación a cualquier página no vinculada desde la página actual, cierre de la ventana del navegador activo, oUn tiempo de espera de inactividad de sesión de 30 minutos. Se proporcionan más detalles sobre la extracción de los senderos de búsqueda en trabajos anteriores [33]. En total, se extrajeron alrededor de 12.5 millones de senderos de búsqueda (que contienen alrededor de 60 millones de documentos) de los registros para todos los usuarios. El número medio de senderos de búsqueda por usuario fue de 30. El número medio de pasos en los senderos fue de 3. Todos los senderos de búsqueda contenían una página de resultados de búsqueda y al menos una página en una ruta de hipervínculo que conduce desde la página de resultados. La extracción de estos senderos nos permitió estudiar aspectos del comportamiento de navegación posterior a la cuota, a saber, la duración promedio de las sesiones de búsqueda de usuarios, la duración promedio de los senderos de búsqueda de los usuarios, el tiempo promedio de visualización de cada documento, el número promedio de pasos en los senderos de búsqueda de usuarios,El número de sucursales en los patrones de navegación de los usuarios y el número de operaciones posteriores en los senderos de búsqueda de usuarios. Todos los senderos de búsqueda contienen al menos una rama que representa cualquier movimiento hacia adelante en la ruta de navegación. Un sendero puede tener ramas adicionales si el usuario hace clic en el botón de retroceso de los navegadores e inmediatamente avanza a otra página antes de la siguiente (si la hay) operación de retroceso. Las características de navegación posterior a la QUIE se describen más adelante en la Tabla 2. Tabla 2. Características de navegación posterior a la cuarta (por sendero). Característica Significa la longitud promedio de la sesión de la sesión de segundos de sesión (SS) (en segundos). Pasos (NS) Número promedio de pasos desde la página Siguiendo la página de resultados hasta el final del número de senderos. Ramas (NB) Número promedio de ramas num. Backs (NBA) Número promedio de operaciones posteriores, así como el uso de estos atributos de las interacciones de los usuarios, también utilizamos los juicios de relevancia descritos anteriormente en el documento para medir el grado de éxito de la búsqueda en función de los juicios de relevancia asignados a las páginas que se encuentran en la búsquedacamino. Dado que no teníamos acceso a evaluaciones de relevancia de nuestros usuarios, se aproximamos a estas evaluaciones utilizando juicios recopilados como parte de la investigación en curso sobre el rendimiento del motor de búsqueda. 2 Estos juicios fueron creados por asesores humanos capacitados para 10,680 consultas únicas. De los 1.420,625 pasos en los senderos de búsqueda que comenzaron con cualquiera de estas consultas, tenemos juicios de relevancia para 802,160 (56.4%). Utilizamos estos juicios para aproximar el éxito de la búsqueda de un sendero dado de varias maneras. En la Tabla 3 enumeramos estas medidas.2 Nuestra evaluación del éxito de la búsqueda es bastante cruda en comparación con lo que hubiera sido posible si hubiéramos podido contactar a nuestros sujetos. Abordamos este problema de manera similar al utilizado por la Conferencia de recuperación de texto (TREC) [21], ya que dado que no podemos determinar el éxito de búsqueda percibido, aproximamos el éxito de la búsqueda basado en decenas de relevancia asignadas de documentos visitados. Tabla 3. Medidas de juicio de relevancia (por sendero). Medida significado que el primer juicio asignado a la primera página en el sendero Final Judy Assignada a la última página en el juicio promedio promedio del sendero en todas las páginas en el sendero juicio máximo máximo en todas las páginas en el sendero Estas medidas se usan durante nuestro análisis para estimar elRelevancia de las páginas vistas en diferentes etapas en los senderos y nos permite estimar el éxito de la búsqueda de diferentes maneras. Elegimos múltiples medidas, ya que los usuarios pueden encontrar información relevante de muchas maneras y en diferentes puntos del sendero (por ejemplo, un documento único altamente creloso o gradualmente en el transcurso del sendero). Las características descritas en esta sección nos permitieron analizar atributos importantes del proceso de búsqueda que deben entenderse mejor si queremos apoyar a los usuarios en su búsqueda. En la siguiente sección presentamos los hallazgos del análisis.5. Hallazgos Nuestro análisis se divide en tres partes: Análisis del comportamiento de consulta e interacción con la página de resultados, análisis del comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Quera y el éxito de la búsqueda en términos de localización de documentos de relevantes jueces. Se usan pruebas estadísticas paramétricas y el nivel de importancia para las pruebas estadísticas se establece en .05.5.1 Consulta y comportamiento de clic de resultados Nos interesaron en comparar la consulta y los comportamientos de consulta con clic de nuestros usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. En la Tabla 4 mostramos los valores promedio medios para cada una de las siete funciones de búsqueda para nuestros usuarios. Usamos Padvanced para denotar el porcentaje de todas las consultas de cada usuario que contiene sintaxis avanzada (es decir, Padvanced = 0% significa que un usuario nunca usó sintaxis avanzada). La tabla muestra valores para los usuarios que no usan operadores de consultas (0%), usuarios que presentaron al menos una consulta con los operadores (≥ 0%), a los usuarios cuyas consultas contenían operadores al menos tres cuartos del tiempo (≥ 75%). Tabla 4. Consulta y resulta características de clic (por usuario).

Las columnas correspondientes a estos dos grupos están en negrita en la Tabla 4. Realizamos una TTEST de medidas independientes entre estos grupos para cada una de las características. Dado que este análisis involucró muchas características, utilizamos una corrección de Bonferroni para controlar la tasa de error en términos de experimento y establecer el nivel alfa (α) en .007, es decir, .05 dividido por el número de características. Esta corrección reduce el número de errores de tipo I, es decir, rechazando hipótesis nulas que son verdaderas. Todas las diferencias entre los grupos fueron estadísticamente significativas (todas T (188403) ≥ 2.81, todas p ≤ .002). Sin embargo, dados los grandes tamaños de muestra, es probable que todas las diferencias en las medias fueran estadísticamente significativas. Aplicamos una prueba D de Cohen para determinar el tamaño del efecto para cada una de las comparaciones entre los grupos de usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. Pedido en orden descendente por tamaño del efecto, los hallazgos principales son que en relación con los usuarios no avanzados, usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda: • Consulta con menos frecuencia en una sesión (d = 1.98) • Componga consultas más largas (d = .69) • Haga clic más lejosAbajo la lista de resultados (d = .67) • Envíe más consultas por día (d = .49) • Es menos probable que haga clic en un resultado (d = .32) • Repetir consultas con más frecuencia (d = .16) El aumento del aumentoLa probabilidad de que los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda hagan clic más abajo en la lista de resultados implica que pueden confiar menos en la capacidad de los motores de búsqueda para clasificar primero el documento más relevante, que estén más dispuestos a explorar más allá de las páginas más populares para una consulta dada,que pueden estar presentando diferentes tipos de consultas (por ejemplo, informativo en lugar de navegación), o que pueden haber personalizado su configuración de búsqueda para mostrar más que solo los resultados predeterminados de los 10 mejores. Muchos de los hallazgos enumerados son consistentes con los identificados en otros estudios de consultas avanzadas de consultas y clics de consulta [13] [34]. Dado que el único criterio que empleamos para clasificar a un usuario como buscador avanzado fue su uso de la sintaxis avanzada, ciertamente es prometedor que este criterio parece identificar a los usuarios que interactúan de manera consistente con la que se informó anteriormente para aquellos con más experiencia en búsqueda. Como se mencionó anteriormente, los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda para los cuales se calculan los valores promedio que se muestran en la Tabla 4 son aquellos que envían 50 o más consultas en la duración de 13 semanas de la recopilación de datos y envían al menos una consulta que contiene operadores de consultas avanzadas. En otras palabras, consideramos a los usuarios cuyo porcentaje de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, padvanced, es mayor que cero. El uso de operadores de consultas en cualquier consulta, independientemente de la frecuencia, sugiere que un usuario conoce la existencia de los operadores e implica un mayor grado de familiaridad con el sistema de búsqueda. Además, planteamos la hipótesis de que los usuarios cuyas consultas contenían con mayor frecuencia la sintaxis avanzada puede ser usuarios de motores de búsqueda más avanzados. Para probar esto, investigamos variando el umbral de consulta requerido para calificar para el estado avanzado (Remado). Incrementamos un punto porcentual enrigados a la vez, y registramos los valores de las siete características de consulta y clic en cada punto. Los valores de las características a cuatro hitos (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%y ≥ 75%) se muestran en la Tabla 4. Como se puede ver en la tabla, a medida que aumenta el padvanced, las diferencias en las características entre las que usan sintaxis avanzada y aquellos que no usan sintaxis avanzada se vuelven más sustanciales. Sin embargo, es interesante observar que a medida que aumenta el enriquecedor, el número de consultas presentadas por día en realidad cae (Pearsons R = −.512, t (98) = 5.98, p <.0001). Los usuarios más avanzados pueden necesitar representar menos consultas para encontrar información relevante. Para estudiar los patrones de relación entre estas variables dependientes (incluido el padvanced), aplicamos el análisis factorial [26]. La Tabla 5 muestra la matriz de intercorrelación entre las características y el porcentaje de consultas con operadores (remadrado). Cada celda de la tabla contiene el coeficiente de correlación de los Pearson entre las dos características para un par de columna de fila dada. Tabla 5. Matriz de intercorrelación (características de consulta / resultado de resultados).Padv.

Las columnas 2 - 8 muestran las intercorrelaciones entre las otras características. Existen fuertes correlaciones positivas entre algunas de las características (por ejemplo, el número de palabras en la consulta (QWL) y la probabilidad promedio de hacer clic en un resultado de búsqueda (ACP)). Sin embargo, también hubo correlaciones negativas bastante fuertes entre algunas características (por ejemplo, la longitud promedio de las consultas (QWL) y la probabilidad de hacer clic en un resultado de búsqueda (CP)). El análisis factorial reveló la presencia de dos factores que representan el 83.6% de la varianza. Al igual que la práctica estándar en el análisis factorial, se eliminaron todas las características con una carga de factor absoluta de .30 o menos. Los dos factores que surgieron, con sus respectivas cargas, pueden expresarse como: factor A = .98 (QRR) + .97 (PADV) + .97 (QPS) + .71 (ACP) + .69 (QWL) B Factor B= .96 (CP) + .90 (QPD) + .67 (ACP) + .52 (ASC) Varianza en la consulta y el comportamiento de clic de nuestros usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda se puede expresar utilizando estas dos construcciones. El factor A es el más poderoso, contribuyendo con el 50.5% de la varianza. Parece representar una dimensión de varianza muy básica que cubre los atributos de consulta y el comportamiento de consulta, y sugiere una relación entre las propiedades de consulta (longitud, frecuencia, complejidad y repetición) y la posición de los usuarios hace clic en la lista de resultados. El factor B subyacente de la dimensión representa el 33.1% de la varianza, y describe los atributos del comportamiento de clic de resultados, y una fuerte correlación entre los clics de los resultados y el número de consultas presentadas cada día. Resumen: en esta sección hemos demostrado que existen diferencias marcadas en los aspectos de las consultas y los comportamientos de consulta de los usuarios avanzados en relación con los usuarios no avanzados. También hemos demostrado que cuanto mayor sea la proporción de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, mayores son las diferencias en la consulta y los comportamientos de clic. Un análisis factorial reveló la presencia de dos dimensiones que caracterizan adecuadamente la varianza en la consulta y las características de consulta. En los atributos de consulta de dimensión de consulta, como la longitud y la proporción que contienen sintaxis avanzada, y el comportamiento de consulta, como el número de consultas presentadas por día, ambas afectan la posición de clic del resultado. Además, en la dimensión de clic en el resultado, parece que la frecuencia de consulta diaria influye en las características de clic en el resultado, como la probabilidad de que un usuario haga clic en un resultado de búsqueda y la cantidad de tiempo entre la presentación del resultado y el resultado del resultado de la búsqueda. Las características utilizadas en esta sección son solo interacciones con motores de búsqueda en forma de consultas y clics de resultados. No abordamos cómo los usuarios buscaron información más allá de la página de resultados. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos los senderos de búsqueda descritos en la Sección 4 para analizar el comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Query de los usuarios.5.2 Comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Cuter En esta sección. Observamos varios atributos de los senderos de búsqueda que los usuarios siguieron más allá de la página de resultados en un intento de discernir si el uso de la sintaxis de búsqueda avanzada puede usarse como un predictor de aspectos del comportamiento de interacción posterior.. Como lo hicimos anteriormente, primero describimos los valores promedio medios para cada una de las características de navegación, en todos los usuarios avanzados (es decir, Padvanced> 0%), todos los usuarios no avanzados (es decir, Padvanced = 0%) y todos los usuarios, independientemente de los usuarios deSu nivel de experiencia de búsqueda estimado. Luego observamos el efecto sobre las características de navegación de aumentar el valor de la remadida requerida para ser considerada avanzada del 1% al 100%. En la Tabla 6 presentamos los valores promedio para cada una de estas características para los dos grupos de usuarios. También se muestran el porcentaje de senderos de búsqueda (%senderos) y el porcentaje de usuarios (%de usuarios) utilizado para calcular los promedios. Tabla 6. Características de navegación posterior a la cuarta (por sendero).

Una vez más, las columnas de interés en esta comparación están en negrita. Como lo hicimos en la Sección 5.1 para la consulta y el comportamiento de clic en el resultado, realizamos una TTEST de medidas independientes entre los valores reportados para cada una de las características de navegación posteriores a la Quera. Los resultados de esta prueba sugieren que las diferencias entre las que usan sintaxis avanzada y las que no lo hacen son significativas (t (12495029) ≥ 3.09, p ≤ .002, α = .008). Dados los tamaños de muestra, todas las diferencias entre medias en los dos grupos fueron significativas. Sin embargo, una vez más aplicamos una prueba D de Cohen para determinar el tamaño del efecto. Los hallazgos (clasificados en orden descendente basado en el tamaño del efecto) muestran que en relación con los usuarios no avanzados, usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda: • Revise las páginas en el sendero con menos frecuencia (d = .45) • Pase menos tiempo atravesando cada rastro de búsqueda (d = .38) • Pase menos tiempo viendo cada documento (d = .28) • Rama (es decir, proceda a nuevas páginas después de una operación de retroceso) con menos frecuencia (d = .18) • Siga los senderos de búsqueda con menos pasos (d =.16) Parece que los usuarios avanzados usan un estilo de búsqueda más dirigido que los usuarios no avanzados. Pasan menos tiempo después de senderos de búsqueda y ven los documentos que se encuentran en esos senderos por menos tiempo. Esto está de acuerdo con nuestra proposición anterior de que los usuarios avanzados parecen capaces de discernir la relevancia del documento en menos tiempo. Los usuarios avanzados también tienden a desviarse menos de una ruta directa mientras buscan, con menos revisiones a páginas previamente visitadas y menos ramificación durante su búsqueda. Como lo hicimos en la sección anterior, aumentamos el umbral enriquecido un punto a la vez. Con la excepción del número de operaciones posteriores (NB), los valores atribuibles a cada una de las características cambian a medida que aumentó el remonente. Parece que las diferencias observadas anteriormente entre los usuarios no avanzados y aquellos que usan cualquier sintaxis avanzada se vuelven más significativas a medida que aumenta la potencia. Como en la sección anterior, realizamos un análisis factorial de estas características y enriquecidos. La Tabla 7 muestra la matriz de intercorrelación para todas estas variables. Tabla 7. Matriz de intercorrelación (navegación posterior a la Cuter).PADV SS TS DS NS NB NBA PADV 1.00 .977 −.843 −.867 −.395 −.339 −.249 SS 1.00 −.765 −.875 −.374 −.335 −.237 TS 1.00 .948 .387.281 .250 ds 1.00 .392 .344 .257 ns 1.00 .891 .934 NB 1.00 .918 NBA 1.00 A medida que aumenta la proporción de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, los valores de muchas de las características de navegación posterior a la quiry disminuyen. Solo el tiempo de sesión promedio (SS) exhibe una fuerte correlación positiva con Radvanced. El análisis factorial reveló la presencia de dos factores que representan el 89.8% de la varianza. Una vez más, se eliminaron todas las características con una carga de factor absoluto de .30 o menos. Los dos factores que surgieron, con sus respectivas cargas, pueden expresarse como: factor A = .95 (DS) + .88 (TS) - .91 (SS) - .95 (PADV) Factor B = .99 (NBA)+ .93 (NS) + .91 (NB) La varianza en la consulta y el comportamiento de consulta de los que usan operadores de consultas pueden expresarse utilizando estas dos construcciones. El factor A es el más poderoso, contribuyendo con el 50.1% de la varianza. Parece representar una dimensión temporal muy básica que cubre el tiempo y el porcentaje de consultas con sintaxis avanzada, y sugiere una relación negativa entre el tiempo dedicado al tiempo de búsqueda y el tiempo general de la sesión, y una relación negativa entre el tiempo dedicado a buscar y remonchar. La dimensión de navegación subyacente al factor B representa el 39.7% de la varianza, y describe los atributos de la navegación posterior al Cuareria, todos los cuales parecen estar fuertemente correlacionados entre sí, pero no conmovidos o sincronización. Resumen: en esta sección hemos demostrado que los usuarios avanzados del comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Quera parece más dirigida a los de los usuarios no avanzados. Aunque sus sesiones de búsqueda son más largas, los usuarios avanzados siguen menos senderos de búsqueda durante sus sesiones (es decir, presentan menos consultas), sus senderos de búsqueda son más cortos y sus senderos exhiben menos desviaciones o regresiones a páginas previamente encontradas. También demostramos que a medida que aumenta el tiempo potente, el tiempo de sesión aumenta (quizás los usuarios más avanzados sean multitarea entre la búsqueda y otras operaciones), y la interacción de búsqueda se centra más, tal vez porque los usuarios avanzados pueden dirigirse a la información relevante de manera más efectiva, con menos necesidad de regresiones o regresiones oDesviaciones en sus senderos de búsqueda. Además de los comportamientos de interacción, como consultas, clics de resultados y comportamiento de navegación posterior a la Quera, otro aspecto importante del proceso de búsqueda es el logro de la información relevante para la consulta. En la siguiente sección analizamos el éxito de los usuarios avanzados y no avanzados para obtener información relevante.5.3 El éxito de la búsqueda Como se describió anteriormente, utilizamos juicios de relevancia de seis niveles asignados a pares de documentos de consulta como una medida aproximada del éxito de búsqueda basado en documentos encontrados en los senderos de búsqueda. Sin embargo, las consultas para las cuales tenemos juicios generalmente no contenían operadores avanzados. Para maximizar la probabilidad de cobertura, eliminamos a los operadores avanzados de todas las consultas al recuperar los juicios de relevancia. Los valores medios de juicio de relevancia promedio para cada una de las cuatro métricas, primero, último, promedio y máximo, se muestran en la Tabla 8 para usuarios no avanzados (0%) y usuarios avanzados (> 0%). Tabla 8. Éxito de búsqueda (min. = 1, máx. = 6) (por sendero). Característica Padvanced 0%> 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% Primero M 4.03 4.19 4.24 4.26 4.57 SD 1.58 1.56 1.34 1.38 1.27 Last M 3.79 3.92 4.00 4.13 4.35 SD 1.60 1.57 1.29 1.25 .89 Max.

M 3.93 4.06 4.08 4.08 4.26 SD 1.57 1.51 1.23 1.32 1.14 Los hallazgos sugieren que los usuarios que usan sintaxis avanzada (padvanced> 0%) tuvieron más éxito, en los cuatro medidos de los que nunca usaron sintaxis avanzada (Padvanced = 0%). Estos usuarios no solo tuvieron más éxito en su búsqueda, sino que también tuvieron más éxito (es decir, la desviación estándar en los puntajes de relevancia es menor para los usuarios avanzados y continúa disminuyendo a medida que aumenta el enriquecimiento). Las diferencias en los cuatro puntajes de relevancia promedio media para cada métrica entre estos dos grupos de usuarios fueron significativas con medidas t de medidas t (todas T (516765) ≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125). A medida que aumentamos el valor de Padvanced como en secciones anteriores, el puntaje de relevancia promedio en todas las métricas también aumenta (todas las Pearson R ≥ .654), lo que sugiere que los usuarios más avanzados también tienen más probabilidades de tener éxito en su búsqueda. Los buscadores que usan operadores avanzados pueden tener habilidades adicionales para localizar información relevante, o pueden saber dónde reside esta información en función de la experiencia previa.3 A pesar del hecho de que las cuatro métricas se dirigieron a diferentes partes del rastro de búsqueda (por ejemplo, primero vs. Último)o diferentes formas de recopilar información relevante (por ejemplo, promedio versus máximo), las diferencias entre los grupos y dentro del grupo avanzado fueron consistentes.3 Aunque en nuestros registros no hubo una indicación obvia de más revisiones por parte de los usuarios avanzados de los motores de búsqueda. Para ver si hubo diferencias en la naturaleza de las consultas presentadas por los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda, estudiamos la distribución de los cuatro operadores avanzados: comillas, más, menos y sitio:. En la Tabla 9 mostramos cómo se distribuyeron estos operadores en todas las consultas presentadas por estos usuarios. Tabla 9. Distribución de operadores de consultas. Característica Padvanced> 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75% cotizaciones () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00 Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90 menos ( -) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42 Sitio: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86 AVG.numerOperadores 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49 La distribución de las cotizaciones, más y menos, los operadores son similares entre los cuatro niveles de padvanced, siendo las citas el más popular de los cuatro operadores utilizados. Sin embargo, parece que el operador Plus es el principal diferenciador entre los grupos de usuarios enrollados. Este operador, que obliga al motor de búsqueda a incluir en los términos de consulta que generalmente se excluyen de forma predeterminada (por ejemplo, el, a), puede explicar alguna parte de la diferencia en el éxito de búsqueda observada.4 Sin embargo, esto no captura la contribución queCada uno de estos operadores tiene el aumento de la relevancia en comparación con la exclusión del operador. Para obtener una idea de esto, examinamos el impacto que cada uno de los operadores tuvo sobre la relevancia de los resultados recuperados. Nos centramos en las consultas en Padvanced> 0% donde el mismo usuario había emitido una consulta sin operadores y la misma consulta con los operadores, ya sea antes o después. Aunque hubo pocas consultas con pares coincidentes, y casi todas ellas contenían citas, hubo un pequeño aumento (aproximadamente del 10%) en el puntaje de juicio de relevancia promedio asignado a documentos en el camino con citas en la consulta inicial. Puede ser el caso que las consultas citadas condujeron a la recuperación de documentos más relevantes, o que mejoren mejor las necesidades percibidas de jueces de relevancia y, por lo tanto, conducen a documentos juzgados que reciben puntajes más altos. Se requiere más análisis similar a [8] para probar estas proposiciones más. Resumen: en esta sección hemos utilizado varias medidas para estudiar el éxito de búsqueda de usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. Los resultados de nuestro análisis sugieren que los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda tienen más éxito y tienen más consistencia en la relevancia de las páginas que visitan. Su experiencia de búsqueda adicional puede hacer que estos usuarios sean mejoras para tomar mejores decisiones sobre qué documentos ver, lo que significa que se encuentran consistentemente más información relevante en sus búsquedas. Además, dentro del grupo de usuarios avanzados existe una fuerte correlación entre Padvanced y el grado de éxito de la búsqueda. Los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda pueden ser más expertos en combinar operadores de consultas para formular poderosas declaraciones de consulta. Ahora discutimos los hallazgos de las tres subsecciones y sus implicaciones para el diseño de sistemas de búsqueda web mejorados.4 Vale la pena señalar que no hubo diferencias significativas en la distribución del uso de los tres motores de búsqueda: Google, Yahoo!, O Windows Live Search, entre los usuarios avanzados de los motores de búsqueda, o entre usuarios avanzados y no avanzados.6. Discusión e implicaciones Nuestros hallazgos indican diferencias significativas en la consulta, el hecho de hacer clic, la navegación posterior a la Quera y el éxito de la búsqueda de aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada versus aquellos que no lo hacen. Muchos de estos hallazgos reflejan los que ya se encuentran en estudios previos con grupos de novatos y expertos autoidentificados [13] [19]. Hay varias formas en que un sistema de motores de búsqueda comercial podría beneficiarse de una indicación cuantitativa de experiencia en búsqueda. Esta podría ser otra característica disponible para un motor de clasificación;es decir, puede ser el caso que los buscadores expertos en algunos casos prefieran diferentes páginas que los buscadores novatos. La interfaz de usuario para un motor de búsqueda puede adaptarse a un nivel de experiencia de los usuarios;Quizás las características aún más avanzadas, como la ponderación de término y las sugerencias de expansión de consultas, podrían presentarse a los buscadores más experimentados al tiempo que preservan la simplicidad de la interfaz básica para los novatos. La presentación de resultados también puede personalizarse en función del nivel de habilidad de búsqueda;El trabajo futuro podría reevaluar los beneficios de los fragmentos de contenido, las miniaturas, etc. de una manera que permita diferentes resultados para diferentes niveles de experiencia. Además, si hay historias de navegación disponibles, los destinos de los buscadores avanzados podrían usarse como resultados sugeridos para consultas, evitando y potencialmente mejorando el proceso de búsqueda tradicional [10]. El uso de la interacción de los usuarios avanzados del motor de búsqueda para guiar a otros con menos experiencia es una propuesta atractiva para los diseñadores de los sistemas de búsqueda. En parte, estos buscadores pueden tener más experiencia de navegación posterior a la cuarta que les permite superar las deficiencias de los sistemas de búsqueda [29]. Sus interacciones se pueden usar para apuntar a los usuarios a lugares que visitan los usuarios de motores de búsqueda avanzados [32] o simplemente para capacitar a los buscadores menos experimentados cómo buscar de manera más efectiva. Sin embargo, si los usuarios expertos se utilizarán de esta manera, deberán superarse los problemas de escasez de datos. Nuestros usuarios avanzados solo representaron el 20.1% de los usuarios cuyas interacciones estudiamos. Si bien estos pueden estar entre los usuarios más activos, es poco probable que vean documentos que cubren una gran cantidad de áreas temáticas. Sin embargo, en lugar de centrarse en dónde van (lo que quizás sea más apropiado para aquellos con conocimiento del dominio), los usuarios avanzados de los motores de búsqueda pueden usar movimientos, tácticas y estrategias [2] de las que los usuarios sin experiencia pueden aprender. Alentar a los usuarios a usar sintaxis avanzada les ayuda a aprender cómo formular mejores consultas de búsqueda;Aprovechar el estilo de búsqueda de los buscadores expertos podría ayudarlos a aprender más interacciones exitosas posteriores a la quereria. Una posible limitación a los resultados que informamos es que en investigaciones anteriores, se ha demostrado que los operadores de consultas no mejoran significativamente la efectividad de los resultados de búsqueda web [8], y que los buscadores pueden funcionar tan bien sin ellos [27] Por lo tanto, se podría argumentar que los usuarios que no usan operadores de consultas están más avanzados, ya que no pierden el tiempo usando sintaxis potencialmente redundante en sus declaraciones de consulta. Sin embargo, esto parece poco probable dado que aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada exhibieron comportamientos de búsqueda típicos de los usuarios con experiencia [13], y tienen más éxito en su búsqueda. Sin embargo, en el trabajo futuro nos ampliaremos la definición de usuarios avanzados más allá de los atributos de la consulta para incluir también otros comportamientos de interacción, algunos de los cuales hemos definido en este estudio y otras vías de investigación como el seguimiento ocular [12].7. Conclusiones En este documento, hemos descrito un estudio basado en registros del comportamiento de búsqueda en la web que ha demostrado que el uso de la sintaxis de búsqueda avanzada se correlaciona con otros aspectos del comportamiento de búsqueda, como consultas, resultados de resultados, navegación posterior a la quirera y búsqueda de búsqueda y búsqueda de búsquedaéxito. Aquellos que usan esta sintaxis están activos en línea durante más tiempo, pasan menos tiempo consultando y atravesando senderos de búsqueda, exhiben menos desviación en sus senderos, tienen más probabilidades de explorar los resultados de búsqueda, tomar menos tiempo para hacer clic en los resultados y tienen más éxito en la búsqueda.. Todos estos son rasgos que esperaríamos que los buscadores expertos exhiban. La clasificación cruda de usuarios basada en una sola característica que se puede extraer fácilmente de la secuencia de consultas produce resultados notables sobre el comportamiento de interacción de los usuarios que no usan la sintaxis y las que sí lo hacen. Como hemos sugerido, los sistemas de búsqueda pueden aprovechar las interacciones de estos usuarios para mejorar la clasificación de documentos, la recomendación de la página o incluso la capacitación del usuario. El trabajo futuro incluirá el desarrollo de interfaces de búsqueda y motores de recuperación modificados que utilicen estas características ricas en información, e investigación adicional sobre el uso de estas características como indicadores de experiencia en búsqueda, incluido un análisis de correlación cruzada entre el clic de resultados y la publicación posterior.Comportamiento de consulta.8.

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone.",
        "In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search.",
        "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
        "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: query formulation, search process, relevance feedback.",
        "General Terms Experimentation, Human Factors. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
        "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
        "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
        "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
        "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
        "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
        "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
        "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
        "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
        "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
        "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
        "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
        "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
        "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
        "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
        "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
        "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
        "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
        "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
        "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
        "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
        "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
        "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
        "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
        "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
        "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
        "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
        "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
        "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
        "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
        "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
        "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
        "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
        "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
        "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
        "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
        "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
        "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
        "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
        "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
        "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
        "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
        "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
        "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
        "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
        "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
        "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
        "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
        "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
        "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
        "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
        "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
        "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
        "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
        "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
        "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
        "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
        "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
        "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
        "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
        "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
        "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
        "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
        "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
        "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
        "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
        "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
        "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
        "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",
        "The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Query and result-click features (per user).",
        "Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day Avg.",
        "Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg.",
        "Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating relevant information.",
        "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
        "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
        "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
        "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
        "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
        "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
        "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
        "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
        "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
        "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
        "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",
        "The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2.",
        "Table 2.",
        "Post-query browsing features (per trail).",
        "Feature Meaning Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds) Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds) Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on the trail (in seconds) Num.",
        "Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page following the results page to the end of the trail Num.",
        "Branches (NB) Average number of branches Num.",
        "Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail.",
        "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
        "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
        "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
        "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
        "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",
        "Table 3.",
        "Relevance judgment measures (per trail).",
        "Measure Meaning First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and allow us to estimate search success in different ways.",
        "We chose multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail).",
        "The features described in this section allowed us to analyze important attributes of the search process that must be better understood if we are to support users in their searching.",
        "In the next section we present the findings of the analysis. 5.",
        "FINDINGS Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating judged-relevant documents.",
        "Parametric statistical testing is used, and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05. 5.1 Query and result-click behavior We were interested in comparing the query and result-click behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users.",
        "In Table 4 we show the mean average values for each of the seven search features for our users.",
        "We use padvanced to denote the percentage of all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e., padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax).",
        "The table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%), users who submitted at least one query with operators (≥ 0%), through to users whose queries contained operators at least threequarters of the time (≥ 75%).",
        "Table 4.",

        "The columns corresponding to these two groups are bolded in Table 4.",
        "We performed an independent measures ttest between these groups for each of the features.",
        "Since this analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level (α) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features.",
        "This correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null hypotheses that are true.",
        "All differences between the groups were statistically significant (all t(188403) ≥ 2.81, all p ≤ .002).",
        "However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the means were likely to be statistically significant.",
        "We applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size for each of the comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user groups.",
        "Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: • Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) • Compose longer queries (d = .69) • Click further down the result list (d = .67) • Submit more queries per day (d = .49) • Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) • Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.",
        "Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34].",
        "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
        "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
        "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",
        "We further hypothesized that users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax may be more advanced search engine users.",

        "To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus, minus, and site:.",

        "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
        "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
        "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
        "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
        "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
        "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",
        "More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.",
        "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users.",
        "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
        "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",
        "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success.",
        "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",

        "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
        "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
        "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
        "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
        "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
        "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
        "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
        "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
        "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
        "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
        "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
        "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
        "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
        "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
        "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
        "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
        "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
        "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
        "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
        "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
        "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
        "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
        "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
        "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced <br>search engine</br> users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced <br>search engine</br> users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",

                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these <br>search engine</br> users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of <br>search engine</br> bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",

                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a <br>search engine</br> might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced <br>search engine</br> users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced <br>search engine</br> users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced <br>search engine</br> users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive <br>query</br> expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved <br>query</br> or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced <br>query</br> syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",

                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",

                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",

                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique <br>query</br> statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used <br>query</br> operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between <br>query</br> syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and <br>query</br> expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-<br>query</br> browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-<br>query</br> interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that <br>query</br> operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use <br>query</br> operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their <br>query</br> statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the <br>query</br> to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-<br>query</br> navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the <br>query</br> stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-<br>query</br> behavior. 8.",

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone.",
                "In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search.",
                "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more <br>relevant information</br> and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "General Terms Experimentation, Human Factors. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of <br>relevant information</br> that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",
                "The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.",
                "Table 1.",
                "Query and result-click features (per user).",
                "Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day Avg.",
                "Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg.",
                "Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for <br>relevant information</br> beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating <br>relevant information</br>.",
                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",
                "The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2.",
                "Table 2.",

                "Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail.",
                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
                "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",

                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",

(and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",

                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",

                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",

                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",

                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any <br>advanced syntax</br> [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use <br>advanced syntax</br> regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of <br>advanced syntax</br> in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use <br>advanced syntax</br>, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as <br>advanced syntax</br>. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using <br>advanced syntax</br> exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",

                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",

                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",

                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",

                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",

                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",

                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",

                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",

                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate <br>search behavior</br>.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",

                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",

                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",

                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",

                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and <br>search success</br> of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and <br>search success</br>.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone.",
                "In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search.",
                "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "<br>relevance feedback</br> (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",
                "The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",

                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
                "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
                "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
                "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had <br>relevance</br> judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the <br>relevance</br> of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced <br>query syntax</br> demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced <br>query syntax</br> that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), − (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between <br>query syntax</br> usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
                "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
                "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
                "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
                "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",

                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",

                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",

                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users − 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "Not only were these users more successful in their searching, but they were consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in relevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop as padvanced increases).",
                "The differences in the four mean average relevance scores for each metric between these two user groups were significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765) ≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125).",
                "As we increase the value of padvanced as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all metrics also increases (all Pearsons R ≥ .654), suggesting that more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their searching.",
                "The searchers that use advanced operators may have additional skills in locating relevant information, or may know where this information resides based on previous experience.3 Despite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant information (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between groups and within the advanced group were consistent. 3 Although in our logs there was no obvious indication of more revisitation by advanced search engine users.",
                "To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus, minus, and site:.",
                "In Table 9 we show how these operators were distributed in all queries submitted by these users.",

                "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
                "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",
                "More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.",
                "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users.",
                "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
                "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",
                "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success.",
                "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that <br>expert search</br>ers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of <br>expert search</br>ers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect <br>expert search</br>ers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",
