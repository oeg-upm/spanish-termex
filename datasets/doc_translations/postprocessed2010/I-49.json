We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment. This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents. In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.

INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues. To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues. However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues. When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on. The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences. In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral. In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting. Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation. In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents. Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached. As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases. In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare. Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility. We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible. In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal. Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents. Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol. This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern. The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8]. In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system. In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem. Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach. The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6. Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8. Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2. CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem. Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis. The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens. The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies. The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal. In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations. When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed. For disasters, master plans are executed. These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc. When a victim is found, several actions follow. First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot. Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post. For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology. The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications. Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases. The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims. The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided. In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport. In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic. Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3. PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on. Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital. All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria. The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria. Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate. The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol. In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together. The negotiation also deals with multiple issues. Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone. This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences. Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process. Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities. Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications. Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4. THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol. These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated. The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria. However, for the example of the crisis management 944 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch between the hospitals. These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on. In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6]. The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk . All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1]. The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes. An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ). Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), . . . , uh nk (xnk )) (1) where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function. The overall preference relation over Xk is then x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) . The two-additive Choquet integral is defined for (z1, . . . , znk ) ∈ [0, 1]nk by [7] Hk(z1, . . . , znk ) = X i∈Nk 0 @vk i − 1 2 X j=i |Ik i,j| 1 A zi + X Ik i,j >0 Ik i,j zi ∧ zj + X Ii,j <0 |Ii,j| zi ∨ zj (2) where vk i is the relative importance of criterion i for agent k and Ik i,j is the interaction between criteria i and j, ∧ and ∨ denote the min and max functions respectively. Assume that zi < zj. A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7]. Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones. In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7]. The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j. In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t. Hk on some criteria C ⊆ Nk as follows ωC (Hk, x)= Z 1 0 Hk ` (1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ´ − Hk(x) EC (τ, x) dτ where ((1−τ)xC +τ, xNk\\C ) is the compound act that equals (1 − τ)xi + τ if i ∈ C and equals xi if i ∈ Nk \\ C. Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ). Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed for this improvement. We generally assume that EC is of order 1, that is EC (τ, x) = τ P i∈C (1 − xi). The expression of ωC (Hk, x) when Hk is a Choquet integral, is given in [11]. The agent is then recommended to improve of coalition C for which ωC (Hk, x) is maximum. This recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 5. PROTOCOL MOTIVATIONS For multi-issue problems, there are two approaches: a complete package approach where the issues are negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach where the issues are negotiated one by one. When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5]. Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria. We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol. In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved. This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties. Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic. To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it. At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted. The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement. We decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time. This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold. This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure. In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor. In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced. The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution. Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed. In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted. MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal. In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11]. As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals. We also consider that the dual function can be used to take into account another type of information: on which criteria of a proposal, no improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a proposal is still acceptable, do not decrease. Thus, all information is a constraint to be satisfied as much as possible by The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 945 Figure 1: An illustration of some system. the parties to make a new proposal. We are in a cooperative context and revealing ones opinion on what can be improved is not prohibited, on the contrary, it is useful and recommended here seeing that it helps in converging on an agreement. Therefore, when one of the parties refuses an offer, some information will be communicated. In order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation, we introduce a mediator. This specific entity is in charge of making the proposals to the other parties in the system by taking into account their public constraints (e.g. their availabilities) and the recommendations they make. This mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the crisis management problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g. traffic state, transport mode and time). Each party in a negotiation N, a negotiator, can also be a mediator of another negotiation N , this party becoming the representative of N in the negotiation N, as illustrated by fig. 1 what can also help in reducing the communication time. 6. AGENTIFICATION How the problem is transposed in a MAS problem is a very important aspect when designing such a system. The agentification has an influence upon the systems efficiency in solving the problem. Therefore, in this section, we describe the elements and constraints taken into account during the modelling phase and for the model itself. However, for this negotiation application, the modelling is quite natural when one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main properties. First of all, it seems obvious that there should be one agent for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol. The agents have the involved parties information and preferences. These agents are: • Autonomous: they decide for themselves what, when and under what conditions actions should be performed; • Rational: they have a means-ends competence to fit its decisions, according to its knowledge, preferences and goal; • Self-interested: they have their own interests which may conflict with the interests of other agents. Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD. Each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge. In fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our negotiation protocol, the delegated physician in our application, and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to the other parties, the hospitals. The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent preferences; The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed in the MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the MYRIAD option; Of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in MYRIAD. This model has to be part of the agent so that it could be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the improvements. In addition to these behaviours, the communication acts between the agents is as follows. 1. mediator agent communication acts: 946 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) m1 m 1 1 m inform1 m mediator negotiator accept−proposal l 1 accept−proposal m−l reject−proposal propose propose Figure 2: The protocol diagram in AUML, and where m is the number of negotiator agents and l is the number of agents refusing current proposal. (a) propose: sends a message containing a proposal to all negotiator agents; (b) inform: sends a message to all negotiator agents to inform them that an agreement has been reached and containing the consensus outcome. 2. negotiator agent communication acts: (a) accept-proposal: sends a message to the mediator agent containing the agent recommendations to improve the proposal and obtained with convert_improvements_wc; (b) reject-proposal: sends a message to the mediator agent containing the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed and obtained with convert_no_decrease_wc. Such agents are interchangeable, in a case of failure, since they all have the same properties and represent a user with his preference model, not depending on the agent, but on the model defined in MYRIAD. When the issues and the decision criteria are different from each other, the information about the criteria improvement have to be pre-processed to give some instructions on the directions to take and about the negotiated issues. It is the same for the evaluation of a proposal: each agent has to convert the information about the issues to update its private information and to obtain the values of each attribute of the decision criteria. 7. OUR PROTOCOL Formally, we consider negotiations where a set of players A = {1, 2, . . . , m} and a player a are negotiating over a set Q of size q. The player a is the protocol mediator, the mediator agent of the agentification. The utility/preference function of a player k ∈ A ∪ {a} is Uk, defined using MYRIAD, as presented in Section 4, with a set Nk of criteria, Xk an option, and so on. An offer is a vector P = (P1, P2, · · · , Pm), a partition of Q, in which Pk is player ks share of Q. We have P ∈ P where P is the set of admissible proposals, a finite set. Note that P is determined using all players general constraints on the proposals and Q. Moreover, let ˜P denote a particular proposal defined as as preferred proposal. We also have the following notation: δk is the threshold decrease factor of player k, Φk : Pk → Xk is player ks function to convert a proposal to an option and Ψk is the function indicating which points P has to be improved, with Ψk its dual function - on which points no improvement is necessary. Ψk is obtained using the dual function of ωC (Hk, x): eωC (Hk, x)= Z 1 0 Hk(x) − Hk ` τ xC , xNk\\C ´ eEC (τ, x) dτ Where eEC (τ, x) is the cost/effort to go from (τxC , xNk\\C ) to x. In period t of our consensus procedure, player a proposes an agreement P. All players k ∈ A respond to a by accepting or rejecting P. The responses are made simultaneously. If all players k ∈ A accept the offer, the game ends. If any player k rejects P, then the next period t+1 begins: player a makes another proposal P by taking into account information provided by the players and the ones that have rejected P apply a penalty. Therefore, our negotiation protocol can be as follows: Protocol P1. • At the beginning, we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before. • Wait that all players of A give their opinion Yes or No to the player a. If all players agree on P, this later is chosen. Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point. • If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen. • The utility of players regarding a given offer decreases over time. More precisely, the utility of player k ∈ A at period t regarding offer P is Uk(Φk(Pk), t) = ft(Uk(Φk(Pk))), where one can take for instance ft(x) = x.(δk)t or ft(x) = x − δk.t, as penalty function. Lemma 1. Protocol P1 has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium 1 . Proof : Protocol P1 is first transformed in a game in extensive form. To this end, one shall specify the order in which the responders A react to the offer P of a. However the order in which the players answer has no influence on the course of the game and in particular on their personal utility. Hence protocol P1 is strictly equivalent to a game in 1 A subgame perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium such that players strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the original game [18, 16]. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to unilaterally change his/her action [15]. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 947 extensive form, considering any order of the players A. This game is clearly finite since P is finite and each offer can only be proposed once. Finally P1 corresponds to a game with perfect information. We end the proof by using a classical result stating that any finite game in extensive form with perfect information has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium (see e.g. [16]). Rational players (in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern) involved in protocol P1 will necessarily come up with a subgame perfect equilibrium. Example 1. Consider an example with A = {1, 2} and P = {P1 , P2 , P3 } where the default offer is P1 . Assume that ft(x) = x − 0.1 t. Consider the following table giving the utilities at t = 0. P1 P2 P3 a 1 0.8 0.7 1 0.1 0.7 0.5 2 0.1 0.3 0.8 It is easy to see that there is one single subgame perfect equilibrium for protocol P1 corresponding to these values. This equilibrium consists of the following choices: first a proposes P3 ; player 1 rejects this offer; a proposes then P2 and both players 1 and 2 accepts otherwise they are threatened to receive the worse offer P1 for them. Finally offer P2 is chosen. Option P1 is the best one for a but the two other players vetoed it. It is interesting to point out that, even though a prefers P2 to P3 , offer P3 is first proposed and this make P2 being accepted. If a proposes P2 first, then the subgame perfect equilibrium in this situation is P3 . To sum up, the worse preferred options have to be proposed first in order to get finally the best one. But this entails a waste of time. Analysing the previous example, one sees that the game outcome at the equilibrium is P2 that is not very attractive for player 2. Option P3 seems more balanced since no player judges it badly. It could be seen as a better solution as a consensus among the agents. In order to introduce this notion of balanceness in the protocol, we introduce a condition under which a player will be obliged to accept the proposal, reducing the autonomy of the agents but for increasing rationality and cooperation. More precisely if the utility of a player is larger than a given threshold then acceptance is required. The threshold decreases over time so that players have to make more and more concession. Therefore, the protocol becomes as follows. Protocol P2. • At the beginning we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before. • Wait that all players of A give their opinion Yes or No to the player a. A player k must accept the offer if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where ρk(t) tends to zero when t grows. Moreover there exists T such that for all t ≥ T, ρk(t) = 0. If all players agree on P, this later is chosen. Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point. • If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen. One can show exactly as in Lemma 1 that protocol P2 has at least one subgame perfect equilibrium. We expect that protocol P2 provides a solution not to far from P , so it favours fairness among the players. Therefore, our cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue protocol is the following: Protocol P. • At the beginning we set period t = 0 • a makes a proposal P ∈ P that has not been proposed before, considering Ψk(Pt ) and Ψk(Pt ) for all players k ∈ A. • Wait that all players of A give their opinion (Yes , Ψk(Pt )) or (No , Ψk(Pt )) to the player a. A player k must accept the offer if Uk(Φk(Pk)) ≥ ρk(t) where ρk(t) tends to zero when t grows. Moreover there exists T such that for all t ≥ T, ρk(t) = 0. If all players agree on P, this later is chosen. Otherwise t is incremented and we go back to previous point. • If there is no more offer left from P, the default offer ˜P will be chosen. 8. EXPERIMENTS We developed a MAS using the widely used JADE agent platform [1]. This MAS is designed to be as general as possible (e.g. a general framework to specialise according to the application) and enable us to make some preliminary experiments. The experiments aim at verifying that our approach gives solutions as close as possible to the Maximin solution and in a small number of rounds and hopefully in a short time since our context is highly cooperative. We defined the two types of agents and their behaviours as introduced in section 6. The agents and their behaviours correspond to the main classes of our prototype, NegotiatorAgent and NegotiatorBehaviour for the negotiator agents, and MediatorAgent and MediatorBehaviour for the mediator agent. These classes extend JADE classes and integrate MYRIAD into the agents, reducing the amount of communications in the system. Some functionalities depending on the application have to be implemented according to the application by extending these classes. In particular, all conversion parts of the agents have to be specified according to the application since to convert a proposal into decision criteria, we need to know, first, this model and the correlations between the proposals and this model. First, to illustrate our protocol, we present a simple example of our dispatch problem. In this example, we have three hospitals, H1, H2 and H3. Each hospital can receive victims having a particular pathology in such a way that H1 can receive patients with the pathology burn, surgery or orthopedic, H2 can receive patients with the pathology surgery, orthopedic or cardiology and H3 can receive patients with the pathology burn or cardiology. All the hospitals have similar decision criteria reflecting their preferences on the level of congestion they can face for the overall hospital and the different services available, as briefly explained for hospital H1 hereafter. For hospital H1, the preference model, fig. 3, is composed of five criteria. These criteria correspond to the preferences on the pathologies the hospital can treat. In the case of 948 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 3: The H1 preference model in MYRIAD. the pathology burn, the corresponding criterion, also named burn as shown in fig. 3, represents the preferences of H1 according to the value of Cburn which is the current capacity of burn. Therefore, the utility function of this criterion represents a preference such that the more there are patients of this pathology in the hospital, the less the hospital may satisfy them, and this with an initial capacity. In addition to reflecting this kind of viewpoint, the aggregation function as defined in MYRIAD introduces a veto on the criteria burn, surgery, orthopedic and EReceipt, where EReceipt is the criterion for the preferences about the capacity to receive a number of patients at the same time. In this simplified example, the physician have no particular preferences on the dispatch and the mediator agent chooses a proposal randomly in a subset of the set of admissibility. This subset have to satisfy as much as possible the recommendations made by the hospitals. To solve this problem, for this example, we decided to solve a linear problem with the availability constraints and the recommendations as linear constraints on the dispatch values. The set of admissibility is then obtained by solving this linear problem by the use of Prolog. Moreover, only the recommendations on how to improve a proposal are taken into account. The problem to solve is then to dispatch to hospital H1, H2 and H3, the set of victims composed of 5 victims with the pathology burn, 10 with surgery, 3 with orthopedic and 7 with cardiology. The availabilities of the hospitals are as presented in the following table. Available Overall burn surg. orthop. cardio. H1 11 4 8 10H2 25 - 3 4 10 H3 7 10 - - 3 We obtain a multiagent system with the mediator agent and three agents of type negotiator for the three hospital in the problem. The hospitals threshold are fixed approximatively to the level where an evaluation is considered as good. To start, the negotiator agents send their availabilities. The mediator agent makes a proposal chosen randomly in admissible set obtained with these availabilities as linear constraints. This proposal is the vector P0 = [[H1,burn, 3], [H1, surgery, 8], [H1, orthopaedic, 0], [H2, surgery, 2], [H2, orthopaedic, 3], [H2, cardiology, 6], [H3, burn, 2], [H3, cardiology, 1]] and the mediator sends propose(P0) to H1, H2 and H3 for approval. Each negotiator agent evaluates this proposal and answers back by accepting or rejecting P0: • Agent H1 rejects this offer since its evaluation is very far from the threshold (0.29, a bad score) and gives a recommendation to improve burn and surgery by sending the message reject_proposal([burn,surgery]); • Agent H2 accepts this offer by sending the message accept_proposal(), the proposal evaluation being good; • Agent H3 accepts P0 by sending the message accept_ proposal(), the proposal evaluation being good. Just with the recommendations provided by agent H1, the mediator is able to make a new proposal by restricting the value of burn and surgery. The new proposal obtained is then P1 = [[H1,burn, 0], [H1, surgery, 8], [H1, orthopaedic, 1], [H2, surgery, 2], [H2, orthopaedic, 2], [H2, cardiology, 6], [H3, burn, 5], [H3, cardiology, 1]]. The mediator sends propose(P1) the negotiator agents. H1, H2 and H3 answer back by sending the message accept_proposal(), P1 being evaluated with a high enough score to be acceptable, and also considered as a good proposal when using the explanation function of MYRIAD. An agreement is reached with P1. Note that the evaluation of P1 by H3 has decreased in comparison with P0, but not enough to be rejected and that this solution is the Pareto one, P∗ . Other examples have been tested with the same settings: issues in IN, three negotiator agents and the same mediator agent, with no preference model but selecting randomly the proposal. We obtained solutions either equal or close to the Maximin solution, the distance from the standard deviation being less than 0.0829, the evaluations not far from the ones obtained with P∗ and with less than seven proposals made. This shows us that we are able to solve this multi-issue multilateral negotiation problem in a simple and efficient way, with solutions close to the Pareto solution. 9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new protocol to address multilateral multi-issue negotiation in a cooperative context. The first main contribution is that we take into account complex inter-dependencies between multiple issues with the use of a complex preference modelling. This contribution is reinforced by the use of multi-issue negotiation in a multilateral context. Our second contribution is the use of sharp recommendations in the protocol to help in accelerating the search of a consensus between the cooperative agents and in finding an optimal solution. We have also shown that the protocol has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge to the usual maximum solution. Moreover, we tested this protocol in a crisis management context where the negotiation aim is where to evacuate a whole set of injured people to predefined hospitals. We have already developed a first MAS, in particular integrating MYRIAD, to test this protocol in order to know more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and quickness in finding a consensus. This prototype enabled us to solve some examples with our approach and the results we obtained are encouraging since we obtained quickly good agreements, close to the Pareto solution, in the light of the initial constraints of the problem: the availabilities. We still have to improve our MAS by taking into account The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 949 the two types of recommendations and by adding a preference model to the mediator of our system. Moreover, a comparative study has to be done in order to evaluate the performance of our framework against the existing ones and against some variations on the protocol. 10.

Consideramos dependencias complejas entre múltiples problemas mediante el modelado de las preferencias de los agentes con una herramienta de ayuda de decisiones de criterios múltiples, lo que también nos permite extraer información relevante sobre una evaluación de propuestas. Esta información se utiliza en el protocolo para ayudar a acelerar la búsqueda de un consenso entre los agentes cooperativos. Además, el procedimiento de negociación se define en un contexto de gestión de crisis donde el objetivo común de nuestros agentes también se considera en las preferencias de un agente mediador. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial distribuida]: Agentes inteligentes, Sistemas Multiagentes Teoría de términos generales, Diseño, Experimentación 1. Introducción Los protocolos de negociación de múltiples problemas representan un campo de estudio importante ya que los problemas de negociación en el mundo real a menudo son complejos que involucran múltiples problemas. Hasta la fecha, la mayoría de los trabajos anteriores en esta área ([2, 3, 19, 13]) trataban casi exclusivamente con negociaciones simples que involucran temas independientes. Sin embargo, los problemas de negociación del mundo real implican dependencias complejas entre múltiples problemas. Cuando uno quiere comprar un automóvil, por ejemplo, el valor de un automóvil determinado depende en gran medida de su precio, consumo, comodidad, etc. La adición de tales interdependencias complica en gran medida las funciones de utilidad de los agentes y las funciones de utilidad clásica, como la suma ponderada, no son suficientes para modelar este tipo de preferencias. En [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], los autores consideran interdependencias entre problemas, con mayor frecuencia definidos con valores booleanos, excepto [9], mientras que podemos tratar con problemas dependientes continuos y discretos gracias al poder de modeladode la integral Choquet. En [17], los autores se ocupan de la negociación bilateral mientras estamos interesados en un entorno de negociación multilateral. Klein et al.[10] Presente un enfoque similar al nuestro, utilizando también un mediador e información sobre la fortaleza de la aprobación o rechazo que un agente realiza durante la negociación. En nuestro protocolo, utilizamos información más precisa para mejorar las propuestas gracias a la metodología y herramientas de criterios múltiples utilizados para modelar las preferencias de nuestros agentes. Lin, en [14, 20], también presenta un servicio de mediación, pero utilizando un algoritmo evolutivo para alcanzar soluciones óptimas y, como se explica en [4], los jugadores en los modelos evolutivos deben interactuar repetidamente entre sí hasta que se alcance el estado estable. A medida que aumenta el tamaño de la población, el tiempo que le toma a la población estabilizarse también aumenta, lo que resulta en un cálculo excesivo, comunicación y gastos generales de tiempo que pueden volverse prohibitivos, y para negociaciones de uno a muchos y muchos a muchos, los gastos generalesAfecta a medida que aumenta el número de jugadores. En [9], los autores consideran una función de utilidad no lineal mediante el uso de restricciones en el dominio de los problemas y un servicio de mediación para encontrar una combinación de ofertas que maximicen el bienestar social. Nuestro modelo de preferencia, una función de utilidad no lineal también es más complejo que [9] uno ya que la integral de Choquet tiene en cuenta las interacciones y la importancia de cada criterio/problema de decisión, no solo las dependencias entre los valores de los problemas, para determinarla utilidad. También utilizamos un protocolo iterativo que nos permite encontrar una solución incluso cuando no es posible una combinación de oferta. En este documento, proponemos un protocolo de negociación adecuado para múltiples agentes con preferencias complejas y teniendo en cuenta, al mismo tiempo, múltiples cuestiones y recomendaciones interdependientes hechas por los agentes para mejorar una propuesta. Además, las preferencias de nuestros agentes se modelan utilizando una metodología y herramientas de criterios múltiples que nos permiten tener en cuenta la información sobre las mejoras que se pueden hacer a una propuesta, para ayudar a acelerar la búsqueda de un consenso entre los agentes. Por lo tanto, proponemos un protocolo de negociación que consiste en resolver nuestro problema de decisión utilizando un MAS con una decisión de criterios múltiples que ayuda al modelado a nivel de agente y un protocolo de negociación multilateral de problemas múltiples basado en la cooperación. Este protocolo se estudia bajo un enfoque no cooperativo y se muestra 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas que tiene un subgame equilibrios perfectos, siempre que los agentes se comporten racionalmente en el sentido de Von Neumann y Morgenstern. El enfoque propuesto en este documento se ha introducido y presentado por primera vez en [8]. En este artículo, presentamos nuestros primeros experimentos, con algunos resultados notables y un sistema de agente múltiple más complejo con representantes para permitirnos tener un sistema más robusto. En la Sección 2, presentamos nuestra aplicación, un problema de gestión de crisis. La Sección 3 trata el aspecto general del enfoque propuesto. El modelado de preferencias se describe en la sección.4, mientras que las motivaciones de nuestro protocolo se consideran en la secta.5 y el modelado de agente/multiagente en la secta.6. La Sección 7 presenta el modelado formal y las propiedades de nuestro protocolo antes de presentar nuestros primeros experimentos en la Secta.8. Finalmente, en la Sección 9, concluimos y presentamos el trabajo futuro.2. Estudio de caso Este protocolo se aplica a un problema de gestión de crisis. La gestión de crisis es un campo de gestión relativamente nuevo y está compuesto por tres tipos de actividades: prevención de crisis, preparación operativa y gestión de la crisis declarada. La prevención de crisis tiene como objetivo llevar el riesgo de crisis a un nivel aceptable y, cuando sea posible, evite que la crisis realmente ocurra. La preparación operativa incluye planificación, capacitación y simulación avanzada estratégica para garantizar la disponibilidad, la rápida movilización y el despliegue de recursos para tratar posibles emergencias. La gestión de la crisis declarada es la respuesta a, incluida la evacuación, búsqueda y rescate, y la recuperación de la crisis al minimizar los efectos de las crisis, limitar el impacto en la comunidad y el medio ambiente y, a largo plazo, al llevar elLos sistemas comunitarios vuelven a la normalidad. En este artículo, nos centramos en la parte de respuesta del manejo de la actividad de crisis declarada, y particularmente en la evacuación de las personas lesionadas en situaciones de desastre. Cuando se declara una crisis, se ejecutan los planes definidos durante la actividad de preparación operativa. Para los desastres, se ejecutan los planes maestros. Estos planes son elaborados por las autoridades con la colaboración de agencias de protección civil, policía, servicios de salud, organizaciones no gubernamentales, etc. Cuando se encuentra una víctima, siguen varias acciones. Primero, se asigna una fiesta de rescate a la víctima que se examina y recibe primeros auxilios en el acto. Luego, las víctimas pueden ser colocadas en un centro de emergencia en el suelo llamado Medical Advanced Post. Para todas las víctimas, un médico de clasificación, generalmente un médico del hospital, examina la gravedad de sus lesiones y clasifica a las víctimas por patología. La evacuación por transporte de salud de emergencia si es necesario puede tener lugar después de estos exámenes clínicos y clasificaciones. Hoy en día, para evacuar a las personas lesionadas, los médicos se comunican con el centro de llamadas de emergencia para transmitir las evaluaciones médicas de los casos más urgentes. El centro de llamadas de emergencia luego busca espacios disponibles y apropiados en los hospitales para cuidar a estas víctimas. Los médicos son informados de las asignaciones, por lo que pueden proceder a las evacuaciones que eligen los transportes de salud de emergencia de acuerdo con las patologías y los modos de transporte proporcionados. En este contexto, podemos observar que la evacuación se basa en tres elementos importantes: el examen y la clasificación de las víctimas, la búsqueda de una asignación y el transporte. En el caso de los ataques de Madrid del 11 de marzo de 2004, por ejemplo, algunas personas heridas no recibieron la atención médica adecuada porque, durante la búsqueda del espacio, el centro de llamadas de emergencia no consideró las limitaciones de transporte y, en particular, el tráfico. Por lo tanto, para un problema de gestión de crisis a gran escala, es necesario apoyar al centro de llamadas de emergencia y a los médicos en el envío para tener en cuenta los hospitales y las limitaciones de transporte y las disponibilidades.3. Enfoque propuesto para aceptar una propuesta, un agente debe considerar varios problemas, como, en el caso del problema de gestión de crisis, las disponibles en términos de número de camas por unidad, personal médico y quirúrgico, teatros, etc. Por lo tanto, cada agente tiene sus propias preferencias en correlación con sus limitaciones de recursos y otros criterios de decisión, como, para el estudio de caso, el nivel de congestión de un hospital. Todos los agentes también toman decisiones teniendo en cuenta las dependencias entre estos criterios de decisión. La primera hipótesis de nuestro enfoque es que hay varias partes involucradas e impactadas por la decisión, por lo que tienen que decidir juntos de acuerdo con sus propias limitaciones y criterios de decisión. La negociación es el proceso por el cual un grupo que enfrenta un conflicto se comunica entre sí para tratar de llegar a un acuerdo o decisión mutuamente aceptable y, por lo tanto, los agentes tienen que negociar. El conflicto que tenemos que resolver es encontrar una solución aceptable para todas las partes mediante el uso de un protocolo particular. En nuestro contexto, la negociación multilateral es un tipo de protocolo de negociación que es el más adecuado para este tipo de problema: este tipo de protocolo permite a los hospitales y a los médicos negociar juntos. La negociación también se ocupa de múltiples problemas. Además, otra hipótesis es que estamos en un contexto cooperativo donde todas las partes tienen un objetivo común que es proporcionar la mejor solución posible para todos. Esto implica el uso de un protocolo de negociación que alienta a las partes involucradas a cooperar como satisfacer sus preferencias. Teniendo en cuenta estos aspectos, un sistema de múltiples agentes (MAS) parece ser un método confiable en el caso de un proceso de toma de decisiones distribuido. De hecho, un MAS es una respuesta adecuada cuando la solución tiene que combinar, al menos, características de distribución y capacidades de razonamiento. Otra motivación para usar MAS radica en el hecho de que MAS es bien conocido por facilitar la negociación automatizada en el nivel de toma de decisiones operativas en diversas aplicaciones. Por lo tanto, nuestro enfoque consiste en resolver un problema de decisión multipartidista utilizando un MAS con • Las preferencias de los agentes se modelan utilizando una herramienta de ayuda de decisiones de criterios múltiples, Myriad, que también nos permite considerar problemas de múltiples problemas mediante la evaluación de propuestas en varios criterios.• Un protocolo de negociación multilateral y de múltiples problemas basado en la cooperación.4. El modelo de preferencia consideramos un problema en el que un agente tiene varios criterios de decisión, un conjunto nk = {1 ,..., nk} de criterios para cada agente K involucrado en el protocolo de negociación. Estos criterios de decisión permiten a los agentes evaluar el conjunto de problemas que se negocian. Los problemas corresponden directamente o no a los criterios de decisión. Sin embargo, para el ejemplo de la gestión de crisis 944 el sexto intl. Conf.Sobre el problema de agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), los problemas son el conjunto de víctimas para enviar entre los hospitales. Estos problemas se traducen a criterios de decisión que permiten al hospital evaluar su congestión y, por lo tanto, a un número actualizado de camas disponibles, equipos médicos, etc. Para tener en cuenta la complejidad que existe entre los criterios/problemas, utilizamos una herramienta de decisión de criterios múltiples (MCDA) llamada Myriad [12] desarrollada en Thales para aplicaciones MCDA basadas en una integral Choquet de dos aditivos que es unaBuen compromiso entre la versatilidad y la facilidad para comprender y modelar las interacciones entre los criterios de decisión [6]. El conjunto de los atributos de NK se denota por Xk 1 ,..., Xk nk. Todos los atributos se hacen acorde gracias a la introducción de funciones de utilidad parcial UK I: XK I → [0, 1]. La escala [0, 1] muestra la satisfacción del agente K con respecto a los valores de los atributos. Se identifica una opción X en un elemento de xk = xk 1 × · · · × xk nk, con x = (x1, ..., xnk). Luego, la evaluación general de X viene dada por el Reino Unido (x) = HK (Reino Unido 1 (x1), ..., uh nk (xnk)) (1) donde hk: [0, 1] nk → [0, 1]es la función de agregación. La relación de preferencia general sobre XK es entonces x y ⇐⇒ Reino Unido (x) ≥ Reino Unido (y). La integral de choquet de dos adictos se define para (Z1, ..., Znk) ∈ [0, 1] NK por [7] HK (Z1, ..., Znk) = x i∈NK 0 @VK I-12 x j = i | ik i, j |1 a zi + x ik i, j> 0 ik i, j zi ∧ zj + x ii, j <0 | ii, j |Zi ∨ ZJ (2) donde VK I es la importancia relativa del criterio I para el Agente J e IK I, J es la interacción entre los criterios I y J, ∧ y ∨ denotan las funciones MIN y MAX respectivamente. Suponga que zi <zj. Una interacción positiva entre los criterios I y J representa la complementariedad entre estos criterios (sinergia positiva) [7]. Por lo tanto, el puntaje más bajo de Z en el Criterio I oculta el efecto positivo del mejor puntaje en el criterio J en mayor medida en la evaluación general que el impacto de la importancia relativa de los criterios tomados independientemente de los otros. En otras palabras, la puntuación de Z en Criterion J es penalizada por el puntaje más bajo en el Criterio I.Por el contrario, una interacción negativa entre los criterios I y J representa la sustituibilidad entre estos criterios (sinergia negativa) [7]. El puntaje de Z en el Criterio I se guarda mediante una mejor puntuación en Criterion J. En Myriad, también podemos obtener algunas recomendaciones correspondientes a un indicador ωc (H, x) que mide el valor para mejorar la opción X W.R.T. HK en algunos criterios c ⊆ nk como sigue ωc (hk, x) = z 1 0 HK `(1 - τ) xc + τ, xnk \\ c ´ - hk (x) ec (τ, x) dτ where ((1−τ) xc + τ, xnk \\ c) es el acto de compuesto que es igual a (1 - τ) xi + τ si i ∈ C y iguala xi si i ∈ Nk \\ C. Además, ec (τ, x) es el esfuerzopara pasar del perfil x al perfil ((1 - τ) xc + τ, xnk \\ c). La función ωc (HK, X) representa la mejora promedio de HK cuando los criterios de coalición varían de XC a 1C dividido por el esfuerzo promedio necesario para esta mejora. En general, suponemos que la CE es de orden 1, es decir, EC (τ, x) = τ p i∈C (1 - xi). La expresión de ωc (HK, x) cuando HK es una integral Choquet, se da en [11]. Luego se recomienda el agente para mejorar la coalición c para la cual ωc (HK, x) es máximo. Esta recomendación es muy útil en un protocolo de negociación, ya que ayuda a los agentes a saber qué hacer si quieren que se acepte una oferta sin revelar su propio modelo de preferencia.5. Motivaciones de protocolo Para problemas de múltiples problemas, hay dos enfoques: un enfoque de paquete completo donde los problemas se negocian simultáneamente en oposición al enfoque secuencial donde los problemas se negocian uno por uno. Cuando los problemas dependen, entonces es la mejor opción para negociar simultáneamente sobre todos los temas [5]. Por lo tanto, el paquete completo es el enfoque adoptado para que una oferta esté en el conjunto general de personas lesionadas mientras tiene en cuenta los otros criterios de decisión. Tenemos que considerar que todas las partes del proceso de negociación tienen que acordar la decisión, ya que todas están involucradas e impactadas por esta decisión, por lo que se requiere un acuerdo unánime en el protocolo. Además, ninguna parte puede abandonar el proceso hasta llegar a un acuerdo, es decir, un consenso logrado. Esto tiene sentido ya que una propuesta se refiere a todas las partes. Además, tenemos que garantizar la disponibilidad de los recursos necesarios por las partes para garantizar que una propuesta sea realista. Con este fin, la información sobre estas disponibilidades se utiliza para determinar propuestas admisibles de modo que no se pueda hacer una oferta si una de las partes no tiene suficientes recursos para ejecutarla/lograrlo. Al comienzo de la negociación, cada parte proporciona su máxima disponibilidad, esto que define las limitaciones que deben estar satisfechas por cada oferta presentada. La negociación también tiene que converger rápidamente en un acuerdo unánime. Decidimos presentar en el protocolo de negociación un incentivo para cooperar teniendo en cuenta el tiempo de negociación aprobado. Este incentivo se define sobre la base de una penalización dependiente del tiempo, el factor de descuento como en [18] o un umbral dependiente del tiempo. Esta multa debe usarse en la etapa de aceptación/rechazo de nuestro procedimiento de consenso. De hecho, en el caso de un factor de descuento, cada parte aceptará o rechazará una oferta evaluando la propuesta utilizando su función de utilidad deducida del factor de descuento. En el caso de un umbral dependiente del tiempo, si la evaluación es mayor o igual a este umbral, la oferta se acepta, de lo contrario, en el siguiente período, su umbral se reduce. El uso de una penalización no es suficiente, ya que no ayuda a encontrar una solución. Se necesita información sobre las evaluaciones de las partes involucradas en la negociación. En particular, sería útil saber por qué una oferta ha sido rechazada y/o qué se puede hacer para hacer una propuesta que sería aceptada. Myriad proporciona un análisis que determina las fallas como una opción, aquí una propuesta. En particular, proporciona este tipo de información: qué criterios de una propuesta deben mejorarse para alcanzar la evaluación general más alta posible [11]. A medida que utilizamos esta herramienta para modelar las partes involucradas en la negociación, el mediador puede utilizar la información sobre los criterios para mejorar para elaborar las propuestas. También consideramos que la función dual puede usarse para tener en cuenta otro tipo de información: sobre qué criterios de una propuesta, no es necesaria una mejora para que la evaluación general de una propuesta aún sea aceptable, no disminuya. Por lo tanto, toda la información es una restricción para ser satisfecha tanto como sea posible por el sexto INTL. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 945 Figura 1: Una ilustración de algún sistema.las fiestas para hacer una nueva propuesta. Estamos en un contexto cooperativo y revelamos la opinión sobre lo que se puede mejorar, no está prohibido, por el contrario, es útil y se recomienda aquí ver que ayuda a converger en un acuerdo. Por lo tanto, cuando una de las partes rechaza una oferta, se comunicará alguna información. Para facilitar y acelerar la negociación, presentamos un mediador. Esta entidad específica está a cargo de hacer las propuestas a las otras partes del sistema teniendo en cuenta sus limitaciones públicas (por ejemplo, sus disponibles) y las recomendaciones que hacen. Este mediador también puede considerarse como el representante del interés general que podemos tener, en algunas aplicaciones, como en el problema de gestión de crisis, el médico será el mediador y también tendrá más información que considerar al hacer una oferta (p. Ej.Estado de tráfico, modo de transporte y tiempo). Cada parte en una negociación n, un negociador, también puede ser un mediador de otra negociación n, esta parte se convirtió en el representante de N en la negociación n, como lo ilustra la Fig.1 ¿Qué también puede ayudar a reducir el tiempo de comunicación?6. La agencia de cómo se transpone el problema en un problema MAS es un aspecto muy importante al diseñar dicho sistema. La agente influye en la eficiencia de los sistemas para resolver el problema. Por lo tanto, en esta sección, describimos los elementos y restricciones tomadas en cuenta durante la fase de modelado y para el modelo en sí. Sin embargo, para esta solicitud de negociación, el modelado es bastante natural cuando uno observa las motivaciones del protocolo de negociación y las principales propiedades. En primer lugar, parece obvio que debe haber un agente para cada jugador de nuestro protocolo multilateral de negociación de múltiples problemas. Los agentes tienen la información y las preferencias de las partes involucradas. Estos agentes son: • Autónomos: deciden por sí mismos qué, cuándo y en qué condiciones se deben realizar acciones;• Racional: tienen una competencia de medios para que se ajusten a sus decisiones, de acuerdo con su conocimiento, preferencias y objetivo;• Interestado a sí mismo: tienen sus propios intereses que pueden entrar en conflicto con los intereses de otros agentes. Además, sus preferencias se modelan y se evalúan y analizan una propuesta utilizando innumerables. Cada agente tiene información privada y puede acceder a la información pública como conocimiento. De hecho, hay dos tipos de agentes: el tipo de mediador para los agentes correspondientes al mediador de nuestro protocolo de negociación, el médico delegado en nuestra solicitud y el tipo de negociador para los agentes correspondientes a las otras partes, los hospitales. Los principales comportamientos que un agente de mediador de tipo necesita negociar en nuestro protocolo son los siguientes: • Convert_Improvements: Convierte la información dada por los otros agentes involucrados en la negociación sobre las mejoras a realizar, en restricciones sobre la próxima propuesta a realizar;• Convert_no_Decrease: Convierte la información dada por los otros agentes involucrados en la negociación sobre los puntos que no deben convertirse en restricciones en la próxima propuesta a realizar;• Construct_Proposal: Construye una nueva propuesta de acuerdo con las restricciones obtenidas con Convert_Improvements, Convert_NO_Decrease y las preferencias del agente;Los principales comportamientos que un agente de negociador de tipo necesita negociar en nuestro protocolo son los siguientes: • Convert_Proposal: Convierte una propuesta a una innumerable opción del agente de acuerdo con su modelo de preferencias y sus datos privados;• Convert_improvements_wc: convierte las recomendaciones de agentes para las mejoras de una innumerable opción en información general sobre la propuesta;• Convert_no_Decrease_WC: Convierte las recomendaciones del agente sobre los criterios que no deben cambiarse en la innumerable opción en información general sobre la propuesta;Además de estos comportamientos, existen, para los dos tipos de agentes, los comportamientos de acceso a innumerables funcionalidades, como las funciones de evaluación y mejora: • Evaluar_option: evalúa la innumerable opción obtenida utilizando el comportamiento del agente Convert_proposal;• Mejoras: Obtiene las recomendaciones del agente para mejorar una propuesta de la innumerable opción;• NO_DECREASE: Obtiene las recomendaciones del agente para no cambiar algunos criterios de la innumerable opción;Por supuesto, antes de ejecutar el sistema con tales agentes, debemos haber definido cada modelo de preferencias de la parte en Myriad. Este modelo debe ser parte del agente para que pueda usarse para realizar las evaluaciones y recuperar las mejoras. Además de estos comportamientos, la comunicación actúa entre los agentes es el siguiente.1. Actos de comunicación del agente mediador: 946 El sexto intl.

Acts de comunicación del agente negociador: (a) Aceptar-proposis: envía un mensaje al agente mediador que contiene las recomendaciones del agente para mejorar la propuesta y obtenida con convert_improvements_wc;(b) Rechazar propositía: envía un mensaje al agente mediador que contiene las recomendaciones del agente sobre los criterios que no deben cambiarse y obtener con convert_no_decrease_wc. Tales agentes son intercambiables, en un caso de falla, ya que todos tienen las mismas propiedades y representan a un usuario con su modelo de preferencia, no dependiendo del agente, sino del modelo definido en innumerable. Cuando los problemas y los criterios de decisión son diferentes entre sí, la información sobre la mejora de los criterios debe ser previamente procesada para dar algunas instrucciones sobre las instrucciones a tomar y sobre los problemas negociados. Es lo mismo para la evaluación de una propuesta: cada agente tiene que convertir la información sobre los problemas para actualizar su información privada y obtener los valores de cada atributo de los criterios de decisión.7. Nuestro protocolo formalmente, consideramos negociaciones en las que un conjunto de jugadores a = {1, 2 ,..., M} y un jugador A están negociando sobre un conjunto Q de tamaño q. El jugador A es el mediador de protocolo, el agente mediador de la agente. La función de utilidad/preferencia de un reproductor k ∈ A ∪ {a} está en el Reino Unido, definido usando una miríada, como se presenta en la Sección 4, con un conjunto de criterios, XK una opción, y así sucesivamente. Una oferta es un vector p = (p1, p2, · · ·, pm), una partición de Q, en la que PK es jugador de Ks compartido de Q. Tenemos p ∈ P donde P es el conjunto de propuestas admisibles, un conjunto finito. Tenga en cuenta que P se determina utilizando todos los jugadores de restricciones generales en las propuestas y Q. Además, deje que ˜P denote una propuesta particular definida como una propuesta preferida. También tenemos la siguiente notación: ΔK es el factor de disminución de umbral del jugador k, φk: pk → xk es la función del jugador ks para convertir una propuesta a una opción y ψk es la función que indica qué puntos P debe mejorarse, con ψk suFunción dual: en los que no se necesita mejorar. Ψk se obtiene usando la función dual de ωc (Hk, x): eωc (hk, x) = z 1 0 HK (x) - Hk `τ xc, xnk \\ c ´ eec (τ, x) dτ where eec (τ, x) es el costo/esfuerzo para pasar de (τxc, xnk \\ c) a x. En el período t de nuestro procedimiento de consenso, el jugador A propone un acuerdo P. Todos los jugadores k ∈ A responden a A aceptando o rechazando a P. Las respuestas se realizan simultáneamente. Si todos los jugadores k ∈ A aceptan la oferta, el juego termina. Si algún jugador K rechaza P, entonces comienza el siguiente período t+1: el jugador A hace otra propuesta P teniendo en cuenta la información proporcionada por los jugadores y los que han rechazado P aplican una penalización. Por lo tanto, nuestro protocolo de negociación puede ser el siguiente: Protocolo P1.• Al principio, establecemos el período t = 0 • A hace una propuesta p ∈ P que no se ha propuesto antes.• Espere que todos los jugadores de un dan su opinión sí o no al jugador a. Si todos los jugadores están de acuerdo en P, esto se elige más tarde. De lo contrario, T se incrementa y volvemos al punto anterior.• Si no queda más oferta de P, se eligirá la oferta predeterminada ˜p.• La utilidad de los jugadores con respecto a una oferta dada disminuye con el tiempo. Más precisamente, la utilidad del jugador k ∈ A en el período t con respecto a la oferta P es el Reino Unido (φk (pk), t) = ft (uk (φk (pk))), donde se puede tomar, por ejemplo, ft (x) = x.(ΔK) t o ft (x) = x - ΔK.T, como función de penalización. Lema 1. El Protocolo P1 tiene al menos un subjuego Perfecto Equilibrio 1. Prueba: el protocolo P1 se transforma primero en un juego en forma extensa. Para este fin, uno especificará el orden en que los respondedores reaccionan a la oferta p de a. Sin embargo, el orden en que la respuesta de los jugadores no tiene influencia en el curso del juego y, en particular, en su utilidad personal. Por lo tanto, el Protocolo P1 es estrictamente equivalente a un juego en 1 Un subjuego Perfecto Equilibrio es un equilibrio de tal manera que las estrategias de los jugadores constituyen un equilibrio NASH en cada subjuego del juego original [18, 16]. Un equilibrio de Nash es un conjunto de estrategias, una para cada jugador, de modo que ningún jugador tiene un incentivo para cambiar unilateralmente su acción [15]. El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 947 Forma extensa, considerando cualquier orden de los jugadores A. Este juego es claramente finito ya que P es finito y cada oferta solo se puede proponer una vez. Finalmente, P1 corresponde a un juego con información perfecta. Terminamos la prueba utilizando un resultado clásico que indique que cualquier juego finito en forma extensa con información perfecta tiene al menos un subjuego un equilibrio perfecto (ver, por ejemplo, [16]). Los jugadores racionales (en el sentido de Von Neumann y Morgenstern) involucrados en el Protocolo P1 necesariamente encontrarán un equilibrio perfecto del subjuego. Ejemplo 1. Considere un ejemplo con a = {1, 2} y p = {p1, p2, p3} donde la oferta predeterminada es p1. Suponga que ft (x) = x - 0.1 t.Considere la siguiente tabla que le da a los servicios públicos a t = 0. P1 p2 p3 a 1 0.8 0.7 1 0.1 0.7 0.5 2 0.1 0.3 0.8 Es fácil ver que hay un solo subjuego de equilibrio perfecto para el protocolo P1 correspondiente a estos valores. Este equilibrio consiste en las siguientes opciones: primero A propone P3;El jugador 1 rechaza esta oferta;A propone entonces P2 y ambos jugadores 1 y 2 aceptan de lo contrario están amenazados con recibir la peor oferta P1 para ellos. Finalmente se elige la oferta P2. La opción P1 es la mejor para A, pero los otros dos jugadores lo vetaron. Es interesante señalar que, a pesar de que A prefiere P2 a P3, la oferta P3 se propone por primera vez y esto hace que P2 sea aceptado. Si A propone P2 primero, entonces el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego en esta situación es P3. En resumen, las peores opciones preferidas deben propuestas primero para obtener finalmente la mejor. Pero esto implica una pérdida de tiempo. Analizando el ejemplo anterior, uno ve que el resultado del juego en el equilibrio es P2 que no es muy atractivo para el jugador 2. La opción P3 parece más equilibrada ya que ningún jugador lo juzga mal. Podría verse como una mejor solución como un consenso entre los agentes. Para introducir esta noción de equilibrio en el protocolo, presentamos una condición bajo la cual un jugador estará obligado a aceptar la propuesta, reduciendo la autonomía de los agentes pero para aumentar la racionalidad y la cooperación. Más precisamente si la utilidad de un jugador es más grande que un umbral dado, entonces se requiere aceptación. El umbral disminuye con el tiempo para que los jugadores tengan que hacer más y más concesión. Por lo tanto, el protocolo se convierte en el siguiente. Protocolo P2.• Al principio establecemos el período t = 0 • A hace una propuesta p ∈ P que no se ha propuesto antes.• Espere que todos los jugadores de un dan su opinión sí o no al jugador a. Un jugador K debe aceptar la oferta si el Reino Unido (φk (PK)) ≥ ρk (t) donde ρk (t) tiende a cero cuando t crece. Además, existe tal que para todos t ≥ t, ρk (t) = 0. Si todos los jugadores están de acuerdo en P, esto se elige más tarde. De lo contrario, T se incrementa y volvemos al punto anterior.• Si no queda más oferta de P, se eligirá la oferta predeterminada ˜p. Uno puede mostrar exactamente como en Lemma 1 que el Protocolo P2 tiene al menos un equilibrio perfecto del subjuego. Esperamos que el Protocolo P2 proporcione una solución no lejos de P, por lo que favorece la equidad entre los jugadores. Por lo tanto, nuestro protocolo multilateral múltiple basado en la cooperación es el siguiente: Protocolo P. • Al principio establecemos el período t = 0 • A hace una propuesta p ∈ P que no se ha propuesto antes, considerando ψk (Pt) y ψk(PT) Para todos los jugadores k ∈ A. • Espere que todos los jugadores de A dé su opinión (sí, ψk (PT)) o (no, ψk (PT)) al jugador a. Un jugador K debe aceptar la oferta si el Reino Unido (φk (PK)) ≥ ρk (t) donde ρk (t) tiende a cero cuando t crece. Además, existe tal que para todos t ≥ t, ρk (t) = 0. Si todos los jugadores están de acuerdo en P, esto se elige más tarde. De lo contrario, T se incrementa y volvemos al punto anterior.• Si no queda más oferta de P, se eligirá la oferta predeterminada ˜p.8. Experimentos desarrollamos un MAS utilizando la plataforma Jade Agent ampliamente utilizada [1]. Este MAS está diseñado para ser lo más general posible (por ejemplo, un marco general para especializarse de acuerdo con la aplicación) y permitirnos hacer algunos experimentos preliminares. Los experimentos tienen como objetivo verificar que nuestro enfoque brinde soluciones lo más cercano posible a la solución Maximin y en un pequeño número de rondas y, con suerte, en poco tiempo ya que nuestro contexto es altamente cooperativo. Definimos los dos tipos de agentes y sus comportamientos como se introdujo en la Sección 6. Los agentes y sus comportamientos corresponden a las clases principales de nuestro prototipo, negociadorgente y negociador para los agentes negociadores, y mediasgente y mediador para el agente mediador. Estas clases extienden las clases de Jade e integran una miríada en los agentes, reduciendo la cantidad de comunicaciones en el sistema. Algunas funcionalidades que dependen de la aplicación deben implementarse de acuerdo con la aplicación extendiendo estas clases. En particular, todas las partes de conversión de los agentes deben especificarse de acuerdo con la aplicación desde entonces para convertir una propuesta en criterios de decisión, debemos saber, primero, este modelo y las correlaciones entre las propuestas y este modelo. Primero, para ilustrar nuestro protocolo, presentamos un ejemplo simple de nuestro problema de despacho. En este ejemplo, tenemos tres hospitales, H1, H2 y H3. Cada hospital puede recibir víctimas que tienen una patología particular de tal manera que H1 puede recibir pacientes con la patología de quemadura de patología, cirugía u ortopedia, H2 puede recibir pacientes con la cirugía de patología, ortopedia o cardiología y H3 puede recibir pacientes con quemaduras de patología o cardiología.. Todos los hospitales tienen criterios de decisión similares que reflejan sus preferencias sobre el nivel de congestión que pueden enfrentar para el hospital general y los diferentes servicios disponibles, como se explica brevemente para el Hospital H1 en adelante. Para el Hospital H1, el modelo de preferencia, Fig.3, está compuesto por cinco criterios. Estos criterios corresponden a las preferencias en las patologías que el hospital puede tratar. En el caso de 948 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: El modelo de preferencia H1 en Myriad.La patología Burn, el criterio correspondiente, también llamado Burn como se muestra en la Fig.3, representa las preferencias de H1 de acuerdo con el valor de Cburn, que es la capacidad actual de la quemadura. Por lo tanto, la función de utilidad de este criterio representa una preferencia de tal manera que cuanto más hay pacientes de esta patología en el hospital, menos el hospital puede satisfacerlos, y esto con una capacidad inicial. Además de reflejar este tipo de punto de vista, la función de agregación como se define en Myriad introduce un veto sobre la quema de criterios, cirugía, ortopedia y ereceipt, donde Ereceipt es el criterio de las preferencias sobre la capacidad de recibir varios pacientes con el mismotiempo. En este ejemplo simplificado, el médico no tiene preferencias particulares en el despacho y el agente mediador elige una propuesta al azar en un subconjunto del conjunto de admisibilidad. Este subconjunto tiene que satisfacer lo más posible las recomendaciones hechas por los hospitales. Para resolver este problema, para este ejemplo, decidimos resolver un problema lineal con las limitaciones de disponibilidad y las recomendaciones como restricciones lineales en los valores de envío. El conjunto de admisibilidad se obtiene luego resolviendo este problema lineal mediante el uso de Prolog. Además, solo se tienen en cuenta las recomendaciones sobre cómo mejorar una propuesta. El problema para resolver es enviar al hospital H1, H2 y H3, el conjunto de víctimas compuestas por 5 víctimas con la patología quemada, 10 con cirugía, 3 con ortopédico y 7 con cardiología. Las disponibilidades de los hospitales se presentan en la siguiente tabla. Disponible en general Burn Surg.ortope.cardio. H1 11 4 8 10H2 25 - 3 4 10 H3 7 10 - - 3 Obtenemos un sistema multiagente con el agente mediador y tres agentes del negociador tipo para los tres hospital en el problema. El umbral de los hospitales se fija aproximadamente al nivel donde una evaluación se considera buena. Para comenzar, los agentes negociadores envían sus disponibilidades. El agente mediador hace una propuesta elegida al azar en el conjunto admisible obtenido con estas disponibilidades como restricciones lineales. Esta propuesta es el vector P0 = [[H1, Burn, 3], [H1, Cirugía, 8], [H1, Ortopédico, 0], [H2, Cirugía, 2], [H2, Ortopédico, 3], [H2, Cardiología, 6], [H3, Burn, 2], [H3, Cardiología, 1]] y el mediador envía proponerse (P0) a H1, H2 y H3 para su aprobación. Cada agente negociador evalúa esta propuesta y responde al aceptar o rechazar P0: • El Agente H1 rechaza esta oferta ya que su evaluación está muy lejos del umbral (0.29, una puntuación incorrecta) y da una recomendación para mejorar la quemadura y la cirugía enviando el mensaje.rechazar_proposal ([quemar, cirugía]);• El Agente H2 acepta esta oferta enviando el mensaje Accept_Proposal (), la evaluación de la propuesta es buena;• El agente H3 acepta P0 enviando el mensaje aceptado_ propuesta (), la evaluación de la propuesta es buena. Solo con las recomendaciones proporcionadas por el Agente H1, el mediador puede hacer una nueva propuesta restringiendo el valor de la quemadura y la cirugía. La nueva propuesta obtenida es entonces P1 = [[H1, Burn, 0], [H1, Cirugía, 8], [H1, Orthopedic, 1], [H2, Cirugía, 2], [H2, Ortopédico, 2], [H2, Cardiología, 6], [H3, Burn, 5], [H3, Cardiología, 1]]. El mediador envía a Proponer (P1) los agentes negociadores. H1, H2 y H3 responden enviando el mensaje Accept_Proposal (), P1 se evalúa con una puntuación lo suficientemente alta como para ser aceptable, y también se considera una buena propuesta cuando se usa la función de explicación de Myriad. Se llega a un acuerdo con P1. Tenga en cuenta que la evaluación de P1 por H3 ha disminuido en comparación con P0, pero no lo suficiente como para ser rechazada y que esta solución es la Pareto One, P ∗. Se han probado otros ejemplos con la misma configuración: problemas en, tres agentes negociadores y el mismo agente mediador, sin modelo de preferencia pero seleccionando al azar la propuesta. Obtuvimos soluciones iguales o cercanas a la solución Maximin, la distancia de la desviación estándar es inferior a 0.0829, las evaluaciones no lejos de las obtenidas con P ∗ y con menos de siete propuestas realizadas. Esto nos muestra que podemos resolver este problema de negociación multilateral de múltiples problemas de una manera simple y eficiente, con soluciones cercanas a la solución de Pareto.9. Conclusión y trabajo futuro Este documento presenta un nuevo protocolo para abordar la negociación multilateral de problemas múltiples en un contexto cooperativo. La primera contribución principal es que tenemos en cuenta las interdependencias complejas entre múltiples problemas con el uso de un modelado de preferencias complejas. Esta contribución se ve reforzada por el uso de la negociación de múltiples problemas en un contexto multilateral. Nuestra segunda contribución es el uso de recomendaciones agudas en el protocolo para ayudar a acelerar la búsqueda de un consenso entre los agentes cooperativos y para encontrar una solución óptima. También hemos demostrado que el protocolo tiene equilibrios perfectos del subjuego y estos equilibrios convergen con la solución máxima habitual. Además, probamos este protocolo en un contexto de gestión de crisis donde el objetivo de negociación es dónde evacuar un conjunto completo de personas lesionadas a hospitales predefinidos. Ya hemos desarrollado un primer MAS, en particular integrando una miríada, para probar este protocolo para saber más sobre su eficiencia en términos de calidad de solución y rapidez para encontrar un consenso. Este prototipo nos permitió resolver algunos ejemplos con nuestro enfoque y los resultados que obtuvimos son alentadores, ya que obtuvimos buenos acuerdos rápidamente, cerca de la solución de Pareto, a la luz de las limitaciones iniciales del problema: las disponibilidades. Todavía tenemos que mejorar nuestro MAS teniendo en cuenta el sexto INTL. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 949 los dos tipos de recomendaciones y agregando un modelo de preferencia al mediador de nuestro sistema. Además, se debe hacer un estudio comparativo para evaluar el rendimiento de nuestro marco contra los existentes y contra algunas variaciones en el protocolo.10.

        "We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment.",
        "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
        "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Design, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
        "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
        "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
        "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
        "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
        "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
        "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
        "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
        "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
        "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
        "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
        "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
        "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
        "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
        "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
        "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
        "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
        "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
        "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
        "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
        "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
        "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
        "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
        "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
        "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
        "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
        "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
        "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
        "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
        "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
        "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
        "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
        "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
        "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
        "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
        "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
        "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
        "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
        "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
        "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
        "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
        "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
        "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
        "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
        "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
        "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
        "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
        "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
        "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
        "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
        "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
        "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
        "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
        "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
        "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
        "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
        "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
        "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4.",
        "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
        "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",
        "The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria.",
        "However, for the example of the crisis management 944 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch between the hospitals.",
        "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
        "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",

                "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION <br>multi-issue negotiation</br> protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral <br>multi-issue negotiation</br> protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",

                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and <br>multi-issue negotiation</br> protocol. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",

                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",

                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",

                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",

                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",

                "We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment.",
                "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a <br>crisis management</br> context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a <br>crisis management</br> problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
                "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a <br>crisis management</br> problem.",
                "<br>crisis management</br> is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale <br>crisis management</br> problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the <br>crisis management</br> problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",
                "The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria.",
                "However, for the example of the <br>crisis management</br> 944 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch between the hospitals.",
                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",
                "The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk .",
                "All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].",
                "The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.",
                "An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ).",
                "Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), . . . , uh nk (xnk )) (1) where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function.",
                "The overall preference relation over Xk is then x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) .",
                "The two-additive Choquet integral is defined for (z1, . . . , znk ) ∈ [0, 1]nk by [7] Hk(z1, . . . , znk ) = X i∈Nk 0 @vk i − 1 2 X j=i |Ik i,j| 1 A zi + X Ik i,j >0 Ik i,j zi ∧ zj + X Ii,j <0 |Ii,j| zi ∨ zj (2) where vk i is the relative importance of criterion i for agent k and Ik i,j is the interaction between criteria i and j, ∧ and ∨ denote the min and max functions respectively.",
                "Assume that zi < zj.",
                "A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].",
                "Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.",
                "In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].",
                "The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j.",
                "In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.",

Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ).",
                "Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed for this improvement.",

                "This recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 5.",
                "PROTOCOL MOTIVATIONS For multi-issue problems, there are two approaches: a complete package approach where the issues are negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach where the issues are negotiated one by one.",
                "When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5].",
                "Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.",
                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",
                "In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved.",
                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",
                "Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.",
                "To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.",
                "The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement.",
                "We decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.",
                "This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.",
                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",
                "The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.",
                "Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.",
                "In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.",
                "MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal.",
                "In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].",
                "As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.",
                "We also consider that the dual function can be used to take into account another type of information: on which criteria of a proposal, no improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a proposal is still acceptable, do not decrease.",

                "Therefore, when one of the parties refuses an offer, some information will be communicated.",
                "In order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation, we introduce a mediator.",
                "This specific entity is in charge of making the proposals to the other parties in the system by taking into account their public constraints (e.g. their availabilities) and the recommendations they make.",
                "This mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the <br>crisis management</br> problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g. traffic state, transport mode and time).",
                "Each party in a negotiation N, a negotiator, can also be a mediator of another negotiation N , this party becoming the representative of N in the negotiation N, as illustrated by fig. 1 what can also help in reducing the communication time. 6.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",

                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",

                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",

                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed <br>decision making</br> process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative <br>decision making</br> level in various applications.",

                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",

                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a <br>multilateral negotiation</br> setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",

                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",

                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, <br>multilateral negotiation</br> is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",

                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",

                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the <br>modelling</br> power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding <br>modelling</br> at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference <br>modelling</br> is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent <br>modelling</br> in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal <br>modelling</br> and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
                "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",
                "The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch between the hospitals.",
                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",
                "The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk .",
                "All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].",
                "The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.",
                "An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ).",
                "Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), . . . , uh nk (xnk )) (1) where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function.",
                "The overall preference relation over Xk is then x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) .",

                "Assume that zi < zj.",
                "A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].",
                "Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.",
                "In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].",
                "The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j.",
                "In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.",

Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ).",
                "Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed for this improvement.",

                "The expression of ωC (Hk, x) when Hk is a Choquet integral, is given in [11].",
                "The agent is then recommended to improve of coalition C for which ωC (Hk, x) is maximum.",
                "This recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 5.",
                "PROTOCOL MOTIVATIONS For multi-issue problems, there are two approaches: a complete package approach where the issues are negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach where the issues are negotiated one by one.",
                "When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5].",
                "Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.",
                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",
                "In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved.",
                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",
                "Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.",
                "To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.",
                "The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement.",
                "We decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.",
                "This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.",
                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",
                "The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.",
                "Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.",
                "In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.",
                "MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal.",
                "In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].",
                "As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.",
                "We also consider that the dual function can be used to take into account another type of information: on which criteria of a proposal, no improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a proposal is still acceptable, do not decrease.",

                "Therefore, when one of the parties refuses an offer, some information will be communicated.",
                "In order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation, we introduce a mediator.",
                "This specific entity is in charge of making the proposals to the other parties in the system by taking into account their public constraints (e.g. their availabilities) and the recommendations they make.",
                "This mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the crisis management problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g. traffic state, transport mode and time).",
                "Each party in a negotiation N, a negotiator, can also be a mediator of another negotiation N , this party becoming the representative of N in the negotiation N, as illustrated by fig. 1 what can also help in reducing the communication time. 6.",

                "However, for this negotiation application, the <br>modelling</br> is quite natural when one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main properties.",
                "First of all, it seems obvious that there should be one agent for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "The agents have the involved parties information and preferences.",
                "These agents are: • Autonomous: they decide for themselves what, when and under what conditions actions should be performed; • Rational: they have a means-ends competence to fit its decisions, according to its knowledge, preferences and goal; • Self-interested: they have their own interests which may conflict with the interests of other agents.",
                "Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD.",
                "Each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge.",
                "In fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our negotiation protocol, the delegated physician in our application, and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to the other parties, the hospitals.",
                "The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent preferences; The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed in the MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the MYRIAD option; Of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in MYRIAD.",
                "This model has to be part of the agent so that it could be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the improvements.",
                "In addition to these behaviours, the communication acts between the agents is as follows. 1. mediator agent communication acts: 946 The Sixth Intl.",

                "We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment.",
                "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a <br>negotiation protocol</br> suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a <br>negotiation protocol</br> consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue <br>negotiation protocol</br>.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
                "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a <br>negotiation protocol</br> type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a <br>negotiation protocol</br> encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue <br>negotiation protocol</br>. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the <br>negotiation protocol</br>.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",

                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",
                "The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk .",
                "All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].",
                "The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.",
                "An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ).",

                "In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].",

                "When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5].",
                "Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.",
                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",
                "In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved.",
                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",
                "Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.",
                "To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.",
                "The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement.",
                "We decided to introduce in the <br>negotiation protocol</br> an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.",
                "This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.",
                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",
                "The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.",
                "Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.",
                "In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.",
                "MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal.",
                "In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].",
                "As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.",

                "Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD.",
                "Each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge.",
                "In fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our <br>negotiation protocol</br>, the delegated physician in our application, and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to the other parties, the hospitals.",
                "The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent preferences; The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed in the MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the MYRIAD option; Of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in MYRIAD.",
                "This model has to be part of the agent so that it could be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the improvements.",

                "We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment.",
                "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex <br>multi-agent system</br> with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
                "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a <br>multi-agent system</br> (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",

                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",
                "The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk .",
                "All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].",

                "A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].",
                "Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.",
                "In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].",
                "The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j.",
                "In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.",

Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ).",

                "When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5].",
                "Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.",
                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",
                "In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved.",
                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",
                "Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.",
                "To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.",
                "The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement.",
                "We decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.",
                "This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.",
                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",
                "The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.",
                "Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.",
                "In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.",
                "MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal.",
                "In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].",
                "As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.",

                "This mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the crisis management problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g. traffic state, transport mode and time).",

                "Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD.",
                "Each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge.",

                "The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent preferences; The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed in the MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the MYRIAD option; Of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in MYRIAD.",

                "We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi-criteria decision aid tool, also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment.",
                "This information is used in the protocol to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the cooperative agents.",
                "In addition, the negotiation procedure is defined in a crisis management context where the common objective of our agents is also considered in the preferences of a mediator agent.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents, Multiagent systems General Terms Theory, Design, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",
                "The approach proposed in this paper has been first introduced and presented in [8].",
                "In this paper, we present our first experiments, with some noteworthy results, and a more complex multi-agent system with representatives to enable us to have a more robust system.",
                "In Section 2, we present our application, a crisis management problem.",
                "Section 3 deals with the general aspect of the proposed approach.",
                "The preference modelling is described in sect. 4, whereas the motivations of our protocol are considered in sect. 5 and the agent/multiagent modelling in sect. 6.",
                "Section 7 presents the formal modelling and properties of our protocol before presenting our first experiments in sect. 8.",
                "Finally, in Section 9, we conclude and present the future work. 2.",
                "CASE STUDY This protocol is applied to a crisis management problem.",
                "Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities: crisis prevention, operational preparedness and management of declared crisis.",
                "The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and, when possible, avoid that the crisis actually happens.",
                "The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning, training and simulation to ensure availability, rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies.",
                "The management of declared crisis is the response to - including the evacuation, search and rescue - and the recovery from the crisis by minimising the effects of the crises, limiting the impact on the community and environment and, on a longer term, by bringing the communitys systems back to normal.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the response part of the management of declared crisis activity, and particularly on the evacuation of the injured people in disaster situations.",
                "When a crisis is declared, the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed.",
                "For disasters, master plans are executed.",
                "These plans are elaborated by the authorities with the collaboration of civil protection agencies, police, health services, non-governmental organizations, etc.",
                "When a victim is found, several actions follow.",
                "First, a rescue party is assigned to the victim who is examined and is given first aid on the spot.",
                "Then, the victims can be placed in an emergency centre on the ground called the medical advanced post.",
                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",
                "Therefore, each agent has its own preferences in correlation with its resource constraints and other decision criteria such as, for the case study, the level of congestion of a hospital.",
                "All the agents also make decisions by taking into account the dependencies between these decision criteria.",
                "The first hypothesis of our approach is that there are several parties involved in and impacted by the decision, and so they have to decide together according to their own constraints and decision criteria.",
                "Negotiation is the process by which a group facing a conflict communicates with one another to try and come to a mutually acceptable agreement or decision and so, the agents have to negotiate.",
                "The conflict we have to resolve is finding an acceptable solution for all the parties by using a particular protocol.",
                "In our context, multilateral negotiation is a negotiation protocol type that is the best suited for this type of problem : this type of protocol enables the hospitals and the physicians to negotiate together.",
                "The negotiation also deals with multiple issues.",
                "Moreover, an other hypothesis is that we are in a cooperative context where all the parties have a common objective which is to provide the best possible solution for everyone.",
                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",
                "Taking into account these aspects, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) seems to be a reliable method in the case of a distributed decision making process.",
                "Indeed, a MAS is a suitable answer when the solution has to combine, at least, distribution features and reasoning capabilities.",
                "Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating <br>automated negotiation</br> at the operative decision making level in various applications.",
                "Therefore, our approach consists of solving a multiparty decision problem using a MAS with • The preferences of the agents are modelled using a multi-criteria decision aid tool, MYRIAD, also enabling us to consider multi-issue problems by evaluating proposals on several criteria. • A cooperation-based multilateral and multi-issue negotiation protocol. 4.",
                "THE PREFERENCE MODEL We consider a problem where an agent has several decision criteria, a set Nk = {1, . . . , nk} of criteria for each agent k involved in the negotiation protocol.",
                "These decision criteria enable the agents to evaluate the set of issues that are negotiated.",
                "The issues correspond directly or not to the decision criteria.",
                "However, for the example of the crisis management 944 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) problem, the issues are the set of victims to dispatch between the hospitals.",
                "These issues are translated to decision criteria enabling the hospital to evaluate its congestion and so to an updated number of available beds, medical teams and so on.",
                "In order to take into account the complexity that exists between the criteria/issues, we use a multi-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool named MYRIAD [12] developed at Thales for MCDA applications based on a two-additive Choquet integral which is a good compromise between versatility and ease to understand and model the interactions between decision criteria [6].",
                "The set of the attributes of Nk is denoted by Xk 1 , . . . , Xk nk .",
                "All the attributes are made commensurate thanks to the introduction of partial utility functions uk i : Xk i → [0, 1].",
                "The [0, 1] scale depicts the satisfaction of the agent k regarding the values of the attributes.",
                "An option x is identified to an element of Xk = Xk 1 × · · · × Xk nk , with x = (x1, . . . , xnk ).",
                "Then the overall assessment of x is given by Uk(x) = Hk(uk 1 (x1), . . . , uh nk (xnk )) (1) where Hk : [0, 1]nk → [0, 1] is the aggregation function.",
                "The overall preference relation over Xk is then x y ⇐⇒ Uk(x) ≥ Uk(y) .",

                "Assume that zi < zj.",
                "A positive interaction between criteria i and j depicts complementarity between these criteria (positive synergy) [7].",
                "Hence, the lower score of z on criterion i conceals the positive effect of the better score on criterion j to a larger extent on the overall evaluation than the impact of the relative importance of the criteria taken independently of the other ones.",
                "In other words, the score of z on criterion j is penalized by the lower score on criterion i. Conversely, a negative interaction between criteria i and j depicts substitutability between these criteria (negative synergy) [7].",
                "The score of z on criterion i is then saved by a better score on criterion j.",
                "In MYRIAD, we can also obtain some recommendations corresponding to an indicator ωC (H, x) measuring the worth to improve option x w.r.t.",

Moreover, EC (τ, x) is the effort to go from the profile x to the profile ((1 − τ)xC + τ, xNk\\C ).",
                "Function ωC (Hk, x) depicts the average improvement of Hk when the criteria of coalition A range from xC to 1C divided by the average effort needed for this improvement.",

                "The expression of ωC (Hk, x) when Hk is a Choquet integral, is given in [11].",

                "This recommendation is very useful in a negotiation protocol since it helps the agents to know what to do if they want an offer to be accepted while not revealing their own preference model. 5.",
                "PROTOCOL MOTIVATIONS For multi-issue problems, there are two approaches: a complete package approach where the issues are negotiated simultaneously in opposition to the sequential approach where the issues are negotiated one by one.",
                "When the issues are dependant, then it is the best choice to bargain simultaneously over all issues [5].",
                "Thus, the complete package is the adopted approach so that an offer will be on the overall set of injured people while taking into account the other decision criteria.",
                "We have to consider that all the parties of the negotiation process have to agree on the decision since they are all involved in and impacted by this decision and so an unanimous agreement is required in the protocol.",
                "In addition, no party can leave the process until an agreement is reached, i.e. a consensus achieved.",
                "This makes sense since a proposal concerns all the parties.",
                "Moreover, we have to guarantee the availability of the resources needed by the parties to ensure that a proposal is realistic.",
                "To this end, the information about these availabilities are used to determine admissible proposals such that an offer cannot be made if one of the parties has not enough resources to execute/achieve it.",
                "At the beginning of the negotiation, each party provides its maximum availabilities, this defining the constraints that have to be satisfied for each offer submitted.",
                "The negotiation has also to converge quickly on an unanimous agreement.",
                "We decided to introduce in the negotiation protocol an incentive to cooperate taking into account the passed negotiation time.",
                "This incentive is defined on the basis of a time dependent penalty, the discounting factor as in [18] or a time-dependent threshold.",
                "This penalty has to be used in the accept/reject stage of our consensus procedure.",
                "In fact, in the case of a discounting factor, each party will accept or reject an offer by evaluating the proposal using its utility function deducted from the discounting factor.",
                "In the case of a time-dependent threshold, if the evaluation is greater or equal to this threshold, the offer is accepted, otherwise, in the next period, its threshold is reduced.",
                "The use of a penalty is not enough alone since it does not help in finding a solution.",
                "Some information about the assessments of the parties involved in the negotiation are needed.",
                "In particular, it would be helpful to know why an offer has been rejected and/or what can be done to make a proposal that would be accepted.",
                "MYRIAD provides an analysis that determines the flaws an option, here a proposal.",
                "In particular, it gives this type of information: which criteria of a proposal should be improved so as to reach the highest possible overall evaluation [11].",
                "As we use this tool to model the parties involved in the negotiation, the information about the criteria to improve can be used by the mediator to elaborate the proposals.",
                "We also consider that the dual function can be used to take into account another type of information: on which criteria of a proposal, no improvement is necessary so that the overall evaluation of a proposal is still acceptable, do not decrease.",
                "Thus, all information is a constraint to be satisfied as much as possible by The Sixth Intl.",

                "Therefore, when one of the parties refuses an offer, some information will be communicated.",
                "In order to facilitate and speed up the negotiation, we introduce a mediator.",
                "This specific entity is in charge of making the proposals to the other parties in the system by taking into account their public constraints (e.g. their availabilities) and the recommendations they make.",
                "This mediator can also be considered as the representative of the general interest we can have, in some applications, such as in the crisis management problem, the physician will be the mediator and will also have some more information to consider when making an offer (e.g. traffic state, transport mode and time).",
                "Each party in a negotiation N, a negotiator, can also be a mediator of another negotiation N , this party becoming the representative of N in the negotiation N, as illustrated by fig. 1 what can also help in reducing the communication time. 6.",
                "AGENTIFICATION How the problem is transposed in a MAS problem is a very important aspect when designing such a system.",
                "The agentification has an influence upon the systems efficiency in solving the problem.",
                "Therefore, in this section, we describe the elements and constraints taken into account during the modelling phase and for the model itself.",
                "However, for this negotiation application, the modelling is quite natural when one observes the negotiation protocol motivations and main properties.",
                "First of all, it seems obvious that there should be one agent for each player of our multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "The agents have the involved parties information and preferences.",
                "These agents are: • Autonomous: they decide for themselves what, when and under what conditions actions should be performed; • Rational: they have a means-ends competence to fit its decisions, according to its knowledge, preferences and goal; • Self-interested: they have their own interests which may conflict with the interests of other agents.",
                "Moreover, their preferences are modelled and a proposal evaluated and analysed using MYRIAD.",
                "Each agent has private information and can access public information as knowledge.",
                "In fact, there are two types of agents: the mediator type for the agents corresponding to the mediator of our negotiation protocol, the delegated physician in our application, and the negotiator type for the agents corresponding to the other parties, the hospitals.",
                "The main behaviours that an agent of type mediator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_improvements: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the improvements to be done, into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • convert_no_decrease: converts the information given by the other agents involved in the negotiation about the points that should not be changed into constraints on the next proposal to be made; • construct_proposal: constructs a new proposal according to the constraints obtained with convert_improvements, convert_no_decrease and the agent preferences; The main behaviours that an agent of type negotiator needs to negotiate in our protocol are the following: • convert_proposal: converts a proposal to a MYRIAD option of the agent according to its preferences model and its private data; • convert_improvements_wc: converts the agent recommendations for the improvements of a MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; • convert_no_decrease_wc: converts the agent recommendations about the criteria that should not be changed in the MYRIAD option into general information on the proposal; In addition to these behaviours, there are, for the two types of agents, access behaviours to MYRIAD functionalities such as the evaluation and improvement functions: • evaluate_option: evaluates the MYRIAD option obtained using the agent behaviour convert_proposal; • improvements: gets the agent recommendations to improve a proposal from the MYRIAD option; • no_decrease: gets the agent recommendations to not change some criteria from the MYRIAD option; Of course, before running the system with such agents, we must have defined each party preferences model in MYRIAD.",
                "This model has to be part of the agent so that it could be used to make the assessments and to retrieve the improvements.",
                "In addition to these behaviours, the communication acts between the agents is as follows. 1. mediator agent communication acts: 946 The Sixth Intl.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",

                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",

                "This implies the use of a negotiation protocol encouraging the parties involved to cooperate as satisfying its preferences.",

                "Our second contribution is the use of sharp recommendations in the protocol to help in accelerating the search of a consensus between the cooperative agents and in finding an optimal solution.",
                "We have also shown that the protocol has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge to the usual maximum solution.",
                "Moreover, we tested this protocol in a crisis management context where the negotiation aim is where to evacuate a whole set of injured people to predefined hospitals.",
                "We have already developed a first MAS, in particular integrating MYRIAD, to test this protocol in order to know more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and quickness in finding a consensus.",
                "This prototype enabled us to solve some examples with our approach and the results we obtained are encouraging since we obtained quickly good agreements, close to the Pareto solution, in the light of the initial constraints of the problem: the availabilities.",

                "INTRODUCTION Multi-issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues.",
                "To date, most of previous work in this area ([2, 3, 19, 13]) dealt almost exclusively with simple negotiations involving independent issues.",
                "However, real-world negotiation problems involve complex dependencies between multiple issues.",
                "When one wants to buy a car, for example, the value of a given car is highly dependent on its price, consumption, comfort and so on.",
                "The addition of such interdependencies greatly complicates the agents utility functions and classical utility functions, such as the weighted sum, are not sufficient to model this kind of preferences.",
                "In [10, 9, 17, 14, 20], the authors consider inter-dependencies between issues, most often defined with boolean values, except for [9], while we can deal with continuous and discrete dependent issues thanks to the modelling power of the Choquet integral.",
                "In [17], the authors deal with bilateral negotiation while we are interested in a multilateral negotiation setting.",
                "Klein et al. [10] present an approach similar to ours, using a mediator too and information about the strength of the approval or rejection that an agent makes during the negotiation.",
                "In our protocol, we use more precise information to improve the proposals thanks to the multi-criteria methodology and tools used to model the preferences of our agents.",
                "Lin, in [14, 20], also presents a mediation service but using an evolutionary algorithm to reach optimal solutions and as explained in [4], players in the evolutionary models need to repeatedly interact with each other until the stable state is reached.",
                "As the population size increases, the time it takes for the population to stabilize also increases, resulting in excessive computation, communication, and time overheads that can become prohibitive, and for one-to-many and many-to-many negotiations, the overheads become higher as the number of players increases.",
                "In [9], the authors consider a non-linear utility function by using constraints on the domain of the issues and a mediation service to find a combination of bids maximizing the social welfare.",
                "Our preference model, a nonlinear utility function too, is more complex than [9] one since the Choquet integral takes into account the interactions and the importance of each decision criteria/issue, not only the dependencies between the values of the issues, to determine the utility.",
                "We also use an iterative protocol enabling us to find a solution even when no bid combination is possible.",
                "In this paper, we propose a negotiation protocol suited for multiple agents with complex preferences and taking into account, at the same time, multiple interdependent issues and recommendations made by the agents to improve a proposal.",
                "Moreover, the preferences of our agents are modelled using a multi-criteria methodology and tools enabling us to take into account information about the improvements that can be made to a proposal, in order to help in accelerating the search for a consensus between the agents.",
                "Therefore, we propose a negotiation protocol consisting of solving our decision problem using a MAS with a multi-criteria decision aiding modelling at the agent level and a cooperation-based multilateral multi-issue negotiation protocol.",
                "This protocol is studied under a non-cooperative approach and it is shown 943 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS that it has subgame perfect equilibria, provided that agents behave rationally in the sense of von Neumann and Morgenstern.",

                "For all victims, a sorter physician - generally a hospital physician - examines the seriousness of their injuries and classifies the victims by pathology.",
                "The evacuation by emergency health transport if necessary can take place after these clinical examinations and classifications.",
                "Nowadays, to evacuate the injured people, the physicians contact the emergency call centre to pass on the medical assessments of the most urgent cases.",
                "The emergency call centre then searches for available and appropriate spaces in the hospitals to care for these victims.",
                "The physicians are informed of the allocations, so they can proceed to the evacuations choosing the emergency health transports according to the pathologies and the transport modes provided.",
                "In this context, we can observe that the evacuation is based on three important elements: the examination and classification of the victims, the search for an allocation and the transport.",
                "In the case of the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks, for instance, some injured people did not receive the appropriate health care because, during the search for space, the emergency call centre did not consider the transport constraints and, in particular, the traffic.",
                "Therefore, for a large scale crisis management problem, there is a need to support the emergency call centre and the physicians in the dispatching to take into account the hospitals and the transport constraints and availabilities. 3.",
                "PROPOSED APPROACH To accept a proposal, an agent has to consider several issues such as, in the case of the crisis management problem, the availabilities in terms of number of beds by unit, medical and surgical staffs, theatres and so on.",

                "All the hospitals have similar decision criteria reflecting their preferences on the level of congestion they can face for the overall hospital and the different services available, as briefly explained for hospital H1 hereafter.",
                "For hospital H1, the preference model, fig. 3, is composed of five criteria.",

                "Therefore, the utility function of this criterion represents a preference such that the more there are patients of this pathology in the hospital, the less the hospital may satisfy them, and this with an initial capacity.",
                "In addition to reflecting this kind of viewpoint, the aggregation function as defined in MYRIAD introduces a veto on the criteria burn, surgery, orthopedic and EReceipt, where EReceipt is the criterion for the preferences about the capacity to receive a number of patients at the same time.",
                "In this simplified example, the physician have no particular preferences on the dispatch and the mediator agent chooses a proposal randomly in a subset of the set of admissibility.",
                "This subset have to satisfy as much as possible the recommendations made by the hospitals.",
                "To solve this problem, for this example, we decided to solve a linear problem with the availability constraints and the recommendations as linear constraints on the dispatch values.",

                "Moreover, only the recommendations on how to improve a proposal are taken into account.",
                "The problem to solve is then to dispatch to hospital H1, H2 and H3, the set of victims composed of 5 victims with the pathology burn, 10 with surgery, 3 with orthopedic and 7 with cardiology.",

                "Each negotiator agent evaluates this proposal and answers back by accepting or rejecting P0: • Agent H1 rejects this offer since its evaluation is very far from the threshold (0.29, a bad score) and gives a recommendation to improve burn and surgery by sending the message reject_proposal([burn,surgery]); • Agent H2 accepts this offer by sending the message accept_proposal(), the proposal evaluation being good; • Agent H3 accepts P0 by sending the message accept_ proposal(), the proposal evaluation being good.",
                "Just with the recommendations provided by agent H1, the mediator is able to make a new proposal by restricting the value of burn and surgery.",

                "Note that the evaluation of P1 by H3 has decreased in comparison with P0, but not enough to be rejected and that this solution is the Pareto one, P∗ .",

                "We obtained solutions either equal or close to the Maximin solution, the distance from the standard deviation being less than 0.0829, the evaluations not far from the ones obtained with P∗ and with less than seven proposals made.",

                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new protocol to address multilateral multi-issue negotiation in a cooperative context.",
                "The first main contribution is that we take into account complex inter-dependencies between multiple issues with the use of a complex preference modelling.",
                "This contribution is reinforced by the use of multi-issue negotiation in a multilateral context.",
                "Our second contribution is the use of sharp recommendations in the protocol to help in accelerating the search of a consensus between the cooperative agents and in finding an optimal solution.",
                "We have also shown that the protocol has subgame perfect equilibria and these equilibria converge to the usual maximum solution.",
                "Moreover, we tested this protocol in a crisis management context where the negotiation aim is where to evacuate a whole set of injured people to predefined hospitals.",
                "We have already developed a first MAS, in particular integrating MYRIAD, to test this protocol in order to know more about its efficiency in terms of solution quality and quickness in finding a consensus.",
                "This prototype enabled us to solve some examples with our approach and the results we obtained are encouraging since we obtained quickly good agreements, close to the Pareto solution, in the light of the initial constraints of the problem: the availabilities.",
                "We still have to improve our MAS by taking into account The Sixth Intl.",
