Cornell University halpern@cs.cornell.edu Ian Kash Computer Science Dept. Cornell University kash@cs.cornell.edu ABSTRACT A model of providing service in a P2P network is analyzed. It is shown that by adding a scrip system, a mechanism that admits a reasonable Nash equilibrium that reduces free riding can be obtained. The effect of varying the total amount of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfare) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized. The work has implications for many online systems, not only P2P networks but also a wide variety of online forums for which scrip systems are popular, but formal analyses have been lacking.

INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other. Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions. Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it. However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial. For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost. Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it. This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1]. Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system. Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely. These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have. Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic. Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5]. A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19]. These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems. A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files. Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques. However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational. By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions. Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work. Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones. An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8]. Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past. However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful. Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems. A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]). The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation. However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users. Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it. We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol). For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users. However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating. Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing). Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective. This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would. Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear. The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]). Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]). However, they have a different set of problems. Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system. Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request. On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already. A related problem involves handling newcomers. If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks. Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26]. In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems. We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint). This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents. It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency. While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable. In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work. It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists. In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy. We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy. Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy. Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users. In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion. We conclude in Section 7. 2. THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game. Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system. This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma. Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9]. This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings. When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can. For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request. The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request. Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect. Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after. That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it. Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made. For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means. In our model we try to deal with all these issues. Suppose that there are n agents. At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request. Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior. The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request. Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1. We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work. In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it. If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request. The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1. As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit. This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game. Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often. Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n. This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β. When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ). We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering. V t i is determined by agent is strategy. • vt ∈ {j | V t j Bt j = 1} denotes the agent chosen to satisfy the request. This agent is chosen uniformly at random from those who are willing (V t j = 1) and able (Bt j = 1) to satisfy the request. • ut i denotes agent is utility in round t. A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a players requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1. In addition, the time between requests served by a single player is also exponentially distributed. a utility of 1 for a fulfilled request and utility −α for fulfilling a request. Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise. • Ui = P∞ t=0 δt/n ut i denotes the total utility for agent i. It is the discounted total of agent is utility in each round. Note that the effective discount factor is δ1/n since an increase in n leads to a shortening of the time between rounds. Now that we have a model of making and satisfying requests, we use it to analyze free riding. Take an altruist to be someone who always fulfills requests. Agent i might rationally behave altruistically if agent is utility function has the following form, for some α > 0: ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 α if i = vt 0 otherwise. Thus, rather than suffering a loss of utility when satisfying a request, an agent derives positive utility from satisfying it. Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing. For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant. While having a nonstandard utility function might be one reason that a rational agent might use this strategy, there are certainly others. For example a naive user of filesharing software with a good connection might well follow this strategy. All that matters for the following discussion is that there are some agents that use this strategy, for whatever reason. As we have observed, such users seem to exist in some large systems. Suppose that our system has a altruists. Intuitively, if a is moderately large, they will manage to satisfy most of the requests in the system even if other agents do no work. Thus, there is little incentive for any other agent to volunteer, because he is already getting full advantage of participating in the system. Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t). Proposition 2.1. There exists an a that depends only on α, β, and δ such that, in G(n, δ, α, β) with at least a altruists, not volunteering in every round is a dominant strategy for all standard agents. Proof. Consider the strategy for a standard player j in the presence of a altruists. Even with no money, player j will get a request satisfied with probability 1 − (1 − β)a just through the actions of these altruists. Thus, even if j is chosen to make a request in every round, the most additional expected utility he can hope to gain by having money isP∞ k=1(1 − β)a δk = (1 − β)a /(1 − δ). If (1 − β)a /(1 − δ) > α or, equivalently, if a > log1−β(α(1 − δ)), never volunteering is a dominant strategy. Consider the following reasonable values for our parameters: β = .01 (so that each player can satisfy 1% of the requests), α = .1 (a low but non-negligible cost), δ = .9999/day 142 (which corresponds to a yearly discount factor of approximately 0.95), and an average of 1 request per day per player. Then we only need a > 1145. While this is a large number, it is small relative to the size of a large P2P network. Current systems all have a pool of users behaving like our altruists. This means that attempts to add a reputation system on top of an existing P2P system to influence users to cooperate will have no effect on rational users. To have a fair distribution of work, these systems must be fundamentally redesigned to eliminate the pool of altruistic users. In some sense, this is not a problem at all. In a system with altruists, the altruists are presumably happy, as are the standard agents, who get almost all their requests satisfied without having to do any work. Indeed, current P2P network work quite well in terms of distributing content to people. However, as we said in the introduction, there is some reason to believe these altruists may not be around forever. Thus, it is worth looking at what can be done to make these systems work in their absence. For the rest of this paper we assume that all agents are standard, and try to maximize expected utility. We are interested in equilibria based on a scrip system. Each time an agent has a request satisfied he must pay the person who satisfied it some amount. For now, we assume that the payment is fixed; for simplicity, we take the amount to be $1. We denote by M the total amount of money in the system. We assume that M > 0 (otherwise no one will ever be able to get paid). In principle, agents are free to adopt a very wide variety of strategies. They can make decisions based on the names of other agents or use a strategy that is heavily history dependant, and mix these strategies freely. To aid our analysis, we would like to be able to restrict our attention to a simpler class of strategies. The class of strategies we are interested in is easy to motivate. The intuitive reason for wanting to earn money is to cater for the possibility that an agent will run out before he has a chance to earn more. On the other hand, a rational agent with plenty of mone would not want to work, because by the time he has managed to spend all his money, the util will have less value than the present cost of working. The natural balance between these two is a threshold strategy. Let Sk be the strategy where an agent volunteers whenever he has less than k dollars and not otherwise. Note that S0 is the strategy where the agent never volunteers. While everyone playing S0 is a Nash equilibrium (nobody can do better by volunteering if no one else is willing to), it is an uninteresting one. As we will show in Section 4, it is sufficient to restrict our attention to this class of strategies. We use Kt i to denote the amount of money agent i has at time t. Clearly Kt+1 i = Kt i unless agent i has a request satisfied, in which case Kt+1 i = Kt+1 i − 1 or agent i fulfills a request, in which case Kt+1 i = Kt+1 i + 1. Formally, Kt+1 i = 8 < : Kt i − 1 if i = pt , P j=i V t j Bt j > 0, and Kt i > 0 Kt i + 1 if i = vt and Kt pt > 0 Kt i otherwise. The threshold strategy Sk is the strategy such that V t i =  1 if Kt pt > 0 and Kt i < k 0 otherwise. 3. THE GAME UNDER NONSTRATEGIC PLAY Before we consider strategic play, we examine what happens in the system if everyone just plays the same strategy Sk. Our overall goal is to show that there is some distribution over money (i.e., the fraction of people with each amount of money) such that the system converges to this distribution in a sense to be made precise shortly. Suppose that everyone plays Sk. For simplicity, assume that everyone has at most k dollars. We can make this assumption with essentially no loss of generality, since if someone has more than k dollars, he will just spend money until he has at most k dollars. After this point he will never acquire more than k. Thus, eventually the system will be in such a state. If M ≥ kn, no agent will ever be willing to work. Thus, for the purposes of this section we assume that M < kn. From the perspective of a single agent, in (stochastic) equilibrium, the agent is undergoing a random walk. However, the parameters of this random walk depend on the random walks of the other agents and it is quite complicated to solve directly. Thus we consider an alternative analysis based on the evolution of the system as a whole. If everyone has at most k dollars, then the amount of money that an agent has is an element of {0, . . . , k}. If there are n agents, then the state of the game can be described by identifying how much money each agent has, so we can represent it by an element of Sk,n = {0, . . . , k}{1,...,n} . Since the total amount of money is constant, not all of these states can arise in the game. For example the state where each player has $0 is impossible to reach in any game with money in the system. Let mS(s) = P i∈{1...n} s(i) denote the total mount of money in the game at state s, where s(i) is the number of dollars that agent i has in state s. We want to consider only those states where the total money in the system is M, namely Sk,n,M = {s ∈ Sk,n | mS(s) = M}. Under the assumption that all agents use strategy Sk, the evolution of the system can be treated as a Markov chain Mk,n,M over the state space Sk,n,M . It is possible to move from one state to another in a single round if by choosing a particular agent to make a request and a particular agent to satisfy it, the amounts of money possesed by each agent become those in the second state. Therefore the probability of a transition from a state s to t is 0 unless there exist two agents i and j such that s(i ) = t(i ) for all i /∈ {i, j}, t(i) = s(i) + 1, and t(j) = s(j) − 1. In this case the probability of transitioning from s to t is the probability of j being chosen to spend a dollar and has someone willing and able to satisfy his request ((1/n)(1 − (1 − β)|{i |s(i )=k}|−Ij ) multiplied by the probability of i being chosen to satisfy his request (1/(|({i | s(i ) = k}| − Ij )). Ij is 0 if j has k dollars and 1 otherwise (it is just a correction for the fact that j cannot satisfy his own request.) Let ∆k denote the set of probability distributions on {0, . . . , k}. We can think of an element of ∆k as describing the fraction of people with each amount of money. This is a useful way of looking at the system, since we typically dont care who has each amount of money, but just the fraction of people that have each amount. As before, not all elements of ∆k are possible, given our constraint that the total amount of 143 money is M. Rather than thinking in terms of the total amount of money in the system, it will prove more useful to think in terms of the average amount of money each player has. Of course, the total amount of money in a system with n agents is M iff the average amount that each player has is m = M/n. Let ∆k m denote all distributions d ∈ ∆k such that E(d) = m (i.e., Pk j=0 d(j)j = m). Given a state s ∈ Sk,n,M , let ds ∈ ∆k m denote the distribution of money in s. Our goal is to show that, if n is large, then there is a distribution d∗ ∈ ∆k m such that, with high probability, the Markov chain Mk,n,M will almost always be in a state s such that ds is close to d∗ . Thus, agents can base their decisions about what strategy to use on the assumption that they will be in such a state. We can in fact completely characterize the distribution d∗ . Given a distribution d ∈ ∆k , let H(d) = − X {j:d(j)=0} d(j) log(d(j)) denote the entropy of d. If ∆ is a closed convex set of distributions, then it is well known that there is a unique distribution in ∆ at which the entropy function takes its maximum value in ∆. Since ∆k m is easily seen to be a closed convex set of distributions, it follows that there is a unique distribution in ∆k m that we denote d∗ k,m whose entropy is greater than that of all other distributions in ∆k m. We now show that, for n sufficiently large, the Markov chain Mk,n,M is almost surely in a state s such that ds is close to d∗ k,M/n. The statement is correct under a number of senses of close. For definiteness, we consider the Euclidean distance. Given > 0, let Sk,n,m, denote the set of states s in Sk,n,mn such that Pk j=0 |ds (j) − d∗ k,m|2 < . Given a Markov chain M over a state space S and S ⊆ S, let Xt,s,S be the random variable that denotes that M is in a state of S at time t, when started in state s. Theorem 3.1. For all > 0, all k, and all m, there exists n such that for all n > n and all states s ∈ Sk,n,mn, there exists a time t∗ (which may depend on k, n, m, and ) such that for t > t∗ , we have Pr(Xt,s,Sk,n,m, ) > 1 − . Proof. (Sketch) Suppose that at some time t, Pr(Xt,s,s ) is uniform for all s . Then the probability of being in a set of states is just the size of the set divided by the total number of states. A standard technique from statistical mechanics is to show that there is a concentration phenomenon around the maximum entropy distribution [16]. More precisely, using a straightforward combinatorial argument, it can be shown that the fraction of states not in Sk,n,m, is bounded by p(n)/ecn , where p is a polynomial. This fraction clearly goes to 0 as n gets large. Thus, for sufficiently large n, Pr(Xt,s,Sk,n,m, ) > 1 − if Pr(Xt,s,s ) is uniform. It is relatively straightforward to show that our Markov Chain has a limit distribution π over Sk,n,mn, such that for all s, s ∈ Sk,n,mn, limt→∞ Pr(Xt,s,s ) = πs . Let Pij denote the probability of transitioning from state i to state j. It is easily verified by an explicit computation of the transition probabilities that Pij = Pji for all states i and j. It immediatly follows from this symmetry that πs = πs , so π is uniform. After a sufficient amount of time, the distribution will be close enough to π, that the probabilities are again bounded by constant, which is sufficient to complete the theorem. 0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 Euclidean Distance 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 NumberofSteps Figure 1: Distance from maximum-entropy distribution with 1000 agents. 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 Number of Agents 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 MaximumDistance Figure 2: Maximum distance from maximumentropy distribution over 106 timesteps. 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 Number of Agents 0 20000 40000 60000 TimetoDistance.001 Figure 3: Average time to get within .001 of the maximum-entropy distribution. 144 We performed a number of experiments that show that the maximum entropy behavior described in Theorem 3.1 arises quickly for quite practical values of n and t. The first experiment showed that, even if n = 1000, we reach the maximum-entropy distribution quickly. We averaged 10 runs of the Markov chain for k = 5 where there is enough money for each agent to have $2 starting from a very extreme distribution (every agent has either $0 or $5) and considered the average time needed to come within various distances of the maximum entropy distribution. As Figure 1 shows, after 2,000 steps, on average, the Euclidean distance from the average distribution of money to the maximum-entropy distribution is .008; after 3,000 steps, the distance is down to .001. Note that this is really only 3 real time units since with 1000 players we have 1000 transactions per time unit. We then considered how close the distribution stays to the maximum entropy distribution once it has reached it. To simplify things, we started the system in a state whose distribution was very close to the maximum-entropy distribution and ran it for 106 steps, for various values of n. As Figure 2 shows, the system does not move far from the maximum-entropy distribution once it is there. For example, if n = 5000, the system is never more than distance .001 from the maximum-entropy distribution; if n = 25, 000, it is never more than .0002 from the maximum-entropy distribution. Finally, we considered how more carefully how quickly the system converges to the maximum-entropy distribution for various values of n. There are approximately kn possible states, so the convergence time could in principle be quite large. However, we suspect that the Markov chain that arises here is rapidly mixing, which means that it will converge significantly faster (see [20] for more details about rapid mixing). We believe that the actually time needed is O(n). This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that for our example chain (again averaged over 10 runs), after 3n steps, the Euclidean distance between the actual distribution of money in the system and the maximum-entropy distribution is less than .001. 4. THE GAME UNDER STRATEGIC PLAY We have seen that the system is well behaved if the agents all follow a threshold strategy; we now want to show that there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where they do so (that is, a Nash equilibrium where all the agents use Sk for some k > 0.) This is not true in general. If δ is small, then agents have no incentive to work. Intuitively, if future utility is sufficiently discounted, then all that matters is the present, and there is no point in volunteering to work. With small δ, S0 is the only equilibrium. However, we show that for δ sufficiently large, there is another equilibrium in threshold strategies. We do this by first showing that, if every other agent is playing a threshold strategy, then there is a best response that is also a threshold strategy (although not necessarily the same one). We then show that there must be some (mixed) threshold strategy for which this best response is the same strategy. It follows that this tuple of threshold strategies is a Nash equilibrium. As a first step, we show that, for all k, if everyone other than agent i is playing Sk, then there is a threshold strategy Sk that is a best response for agent i. To prove this, we need to assume that the system is close to the steadystate distribution (i.e., the maximum-entropy distribution). However, as long as δ is sufficiently close to 1, we can ignore what happens during the period that the system is not in steady state.3 We have thus far considered threshold strategies of the form Sk, where k is a natural number; this is a discrete set of strategies. For a later proof, it will be helpful to have a continuous set of strategies. If γ = k + γ , where k is a natural number and 0 ≤ γ < 1, let Sγ be the strategy that performs Sk with probability 1 − γ and Sk+1 with probability γ. (Note that we are not considering arbitrary mixed threshold strategies here, but rather just mixing between adjacent strategies for the sole purpose of making out strategies continuous in a natural way.) Theorem 3.1 applies to strategies Sγ (the same proof goes through without change), where γ is an arbitrary nonnegative real number. Theorem 4.1. Fix a strategy Sγ and an agent i. There exists δ∗ < 1 and n∗ such that if δ > δ∗ , n > n∗ , and every agent other than i is playing Sγ in game G(n, δ), then there is an integer k such that the best response for agent i is Sk . Either k is unique (that is, there is a unique best response that is also a threshold strategy), or there exists an integer k such that Sγ is a best response for agent i for all γ in the interval [k , k +1] (and these are the only best responses among threshold strategies). Proof. (Sketch:) If δ is sufficiently large, we can ignore what happens before the system converges to the maximumentropy distribution. If n is sufficiently large, then the strategy played by one agent will not affect the distribution of money significantly. Thus, the probability of i moving from one state (dollar amount) to another depends only on is strategy (since we can take the probability that i will be chosen to make a request and the probability that i will be chosen to satisfy a request to be constant). Thus, from is point of view, the system is a Markov decision process (MDP), and i needs to compute the optimal policy (strategy) for this MDP. It follows from standard results [23, Theorem 6.11.6] that there is an optimal policy that is a threshold policy. The argument that the best response is either unique or there is an interval of best responses follows from a more careful analysis of the value function for the MDP. We remark that there may be best responses that are not threshold strategies. All that Theorem 4.1 shows is that, among best responses, there is at least one that is a threshold strategy. Since we know that there is a best response that is a threshold strategy, we can look for a Nash equilibrium in the space of threshold strategies. Theorem 4.2. For all M, there exists δ∗ < 1 and n∗ such that if δ > δ∗ and n > n∗ , there exists a Nash equilibrium in the game G(n, δ) where all agents play Sγ for some integer γ > 0. Proof. It follows easily from the proof Theorem 4.1 that if br(δ, γ) is the minimal best response threshold strategy if all the other agents are playing Sγ and the discount factor is δ then, for fixed δ, br(δ, ·) is a step function. It also follows 3 Formally, we need to define the strategies when the system is far from equilibrium. However, these far from (stochastic) equilibrium strategies will not affect the equilibrium behavior when n is large and deviations from stochastic equilibrium are extremely rare. 145 from the theorem that if there are two best responses, then a mixture of them is also a best response. Therefore, if we can join the steps by a vertical line, we get a best-response curve. It is easy to see that everywhere that this bestresponse curve crosses the diagonal y = x defines a Nash equilibrium where all agents are using the same threshold strategy. As we have already observed, one such equilibrium occurs at 0. If there are only $M in the system, we can restrict to threshold strategies Sk where k ≤ M + 1. Since no one can have more than $M, all strategies Sk for k > M are equivalent to SM ; these are just the strategies where the agent always volunteers in response to request made by someone who can pay. Clearly br(δ, SM ) ≤ M for all δ, so the best response function is at or below the equilibrium at M. If k ≤ M/n, every player will have at least k dollars and so will be unwilling to work and the best response is just 0. Consider k∗ , the smallest k such that k > M/n. It is not hard to show that for k∗ there exists a δ∗ such that for all δ ≥ δ∗ , br(δ, k∗ ) ≥ k∗ . It follows by continuity that if δ ≥ δ∗ , there must be some γ such that br(δ, γ) = γ. This is the desired Nash equilibrium. This argument also shows us that we cannot in general expect fixed points to be unique. If br(δ, k∗ ) = k∗ and br(δ, k + 1) > k + 1 then our argument shows there must be a second fixed point. In general there may be multiple fixed points even when br(δ, k∗ ) > k∗ , as illustrated in the Figure 4 with n = 1000 and M = 3000. 0 5 10 15 20 25 Strategy of Rest of Agents 0 5 10 15 20 25 BestResponse Figure 4: The best response function for n = 1000 and M = 3000. Theorem 4.2 allows us to restrict our design to agents using threshold strategies with the confidence that there will be a nontrivial equilibrium. However, it does not rule out the possibility that there may be other equilibria that do not involve threshold stratgies. It is even possible (although it seems unlikely) that some of these equilibria might be better. 5. SOCIAL WELFARE AND SCALABITY Our theorems show that for each value of M and n, for sufficiently large δ, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium where all the agents use some threshold strategy Sγ(M,n). From the point of view of the system designer, not all equilibria are equally good; we want an equilibrium where as few as possible agents have $0 when they get a chance to make a request (so that they can pay for the request) and relatively few agents have more than the threshold amount of money (so that there are always plenty of agents to fulfill the request). There is a tension between these objectives. It is not hard to show that as the fraction of agents with $0 increases in the maximum entropy distribution, the fraction of agents with the maximum amount of money decreases. Thus, our goal is to understand what the optimal amount of money should be in the system, given the number of agents. That is, we want to know the amount of money M that maximizes efficiency, i.e., the total expected utility if all the agents use Sγ(M,n). 4 We first observe that the most efficient equilibrium depends only on the ratio of M to n, not on the actual values of M and n. Theorem 5.1. There exists n∗ such that for all games G(n1, δ) and G(n2, δ) where n1, n2 > n∗ , if M1/n1 = M2/n2, then Sγ(M1,n1) = Sγ(M2,n2). Proof. Fix M/n = r. Theorem 3.1 shows that the maximum-entropy distribution depends only on k and the ratio M/n, not on M and n separately. Thus, given r, for each choice of k, there is a unique maximum entropy distribution dk,r. The best response br(δ, k) depends only on the distribution dk,r, not M or n. Thus, the Nash equilibrium depends only on the ratio r. That is, for all choices of M and n such that n is sufficiently large (so that Theorem 3.1 applies) and M/n = r, the equilibrium strategies are the same. In light of Theorem 5.1, the system designer should ensure that there is enough money M in the system so that the ratio between M/n is optimal. We are currently exploring exactly what the optimal ratio is. As our very preliminary results for β = 1 show in Figure 5, the ratio appears to be monotone increasing in δ, which matches the intuition that we should provide more patient agents with the opportunity to save more money. Additionally, it appears to be relatively smooth, which suggests that it may have a nice analytic solution. 0.9 0.91 0.92 0.93 0.94 0.95 Discount Rate ∆ 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 OptimalRatioofMn Figure 5: Optimal average amount of money to the nearest .25 for β = 1 We remark that, in practice, it may be easier for the designer to vary the price of fulfilling a request rather than 4 If there are multiple equilibria, we take Sγ(M,n) to be the Nash equilibrium that has highest efficiency for fixed M and n. 146 injecting money in the system. This produces the same effect. For example, changing the cost of fulfilling a request from $1 to $2 is equivalent to halving the amount of money that each agent has. Similarly, halving the the cost of fulfilling a request is equivalent to doubling the amount of money that everyone has. With a fixed amount of money M, there is an optimal product nc of the number of agents and the cost c of fulfilling a request. Theorem 5.1 also tells us how to deal with a dynamic pool of agents. Our system can handle newcomers relatively easily: simply allow them to join with no money. This gives existing agents no incentive to leave and rejoin as newcomers. We then change the price of fulfilling a request so that the optimal ratio is maintained. This method has the nice feature that it can be implemented in a distributed fashion; if all nodes in the system have a good estimate of n then they can all adjust prices automatically. (Alternatively, the number of agents in the system can be posted in a public place.) Approaches that rely on adjusting the amount of money may require expensive system-wide computations (see [26] for an example), and must be carefully tuned to avoid creating incentives for agents to manipulate the system by which this is done. Note that, in principle, the realization that the cost of fulfilling a request can change can affect an agents strategy. For example, if an agent expects the cost to increase, then he may want to defer volunteering to fulfill a request. However, if the number of agents in the system is always increasing, then the cost always decreases, so there is never any advantage in waiting. There may be an advantage in delaying a request, but it is far more costly, in terms of waiting costs than in providing service, since we assume the need for a service is often subject to real waiting costs, while the need to supply the service is merely to augment a money supply. (Related issues are discussed in [10].) We ultimately hope to modify the mechanism so that the price of a job can be set endogenously within the system (as in real-world economies), with agents bidding for jobs rather than there being a fixed cost set externally. However, we have not yet explored the changes required to implement this change. Thus, for now, we assume that the cost is set as a function of the number of agents in the system (and that there is no possibility for agents to satisfy a request for less than the official cost or for requesters to offer to pay more than it). 6. SYBILS AND COLLUSION In a naive sense, our system is essentially sybil-proof. To get d dollars, his sybils together still have to perform d units of work. Moreover, since newcomers enter the system with $0, there is no benefit to creating new agents simply to take advantage of an initial endowment. Nevertheless, there are some less direct ways that an agent could take advantage of sybils. First, by having more identities he will have a greater probability of getting chosen to make a request. It is easy to see that this will lead to the agent having higher total utility. However, this is just an artifact of our model. To make our system simple to analyze, we have assumed that request opportunities came uniformly at random. In practice, requests are made to satisfy a desire. Our model implicitly assumed that all agents are equally likely to have a desire at any particular time. Having sybils should not increase the need to have a request satisfied. Indeed, it would be reasonable to assume that sybils do not make requests at all. Second, having sybils makes it more likely that one of the sybils will be chosen to fulfill a request. This can allow a user to increase his utility by setting a lower threshold; that is, to use a strategy Sk where k is smaller than the k used by the Nash equilibrium strategy. Intuitively, the need for money is not as critical if money is easier to obtain. Unlike the first concern, this seems like a real issue. It seems reasonable to believe that when people make a decision between a number of nodes to satisfy a request they do so at random, at least to some extent. Even if they look for advertised node features to help make this decision, sybils would allow a user to advertise a wide range of features. Third, an agent can drive down the cost of fulfilling a request by introducing many sybils. Similarly, he could increase the cost (and thus the value of his money) by making a number of sybils leave the system. Concievably he could alternate between these techniques to magnify the effects of work he does. We have not yet calculated the exact effect of this change (it interacts with the other two effects of having sybils that we have already noted). Given the number of sybils that would be needed to cause a real change in the perceived size of a large P2P network, the practicality of this attack depends heavily on how much sybils cost an attacker and what resources he has available. The second point raised regarding sybils also applies to collusion if we allow money to be loaned. If k agents collude, they can agree that, if one runs out of money, another in the group will loan him money. By pooling their money in this way, the k agents can again do better by setting a higher threshold. Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money. These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7. CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy. Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency. Thus, our analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems. It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable. Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate. Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal). There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2? In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings. We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests. It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system. Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance. This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists. What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding. There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior. While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money). It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders. Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests. It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system. There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system. For example, we need to worry about the possibility of agents counterfeiting money or lying about whether service was actually provided. Karma [26] provdes techniques for dealing with both of these issues and a number of others, but some of Karmas implementation decisions point to problems for our model. For example, it is prohibitively expensive to ensure that bank account balances can never go negative, a fact that our model does not capture. Another example is that Karma has nodes serve as bookkeepers for other nodes account balances. Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked. Karma suggests several ways to incentivize nodes to perform these duties. We have not investigated whether these mechanisms be incorporated without disturbing our equilibrium. 8.

Se analiza el efecto de variar la cantidad total de dinero (scrip) en el sistema sobre la eficiencia (es decir, el bienestar social), y se muestra que al mantener la relación apropiada entre la cantidad total de dinero y el número de agentes, la eficiencia esmaximizado. El trabajo tiene implicaciones para muchos sistemas en línea, no solo las redes P2P, sino también una amplia variedad de foros en línea para los cuales los sistemas de guiones son populares, pero han faltado análisis formales.

Introducción Una característica común de muchos sistemas distribuidos en línea es que las personas se brindan servicios entre sí. Las redes de tope de pares (P2P) (como Kazaa [25] o Bittorrent [3]) han demostrado ser populares como mecanismos para compartir archivos, y las aplicaciones como el cálculo distribuido y el almacenamiento de archivos están en el horizonte;sistemas como Seti@Home [24] proporcionan asistencia computacional;Sistemas como SlashDot [21] proporcionan contenido, evaluaciones y foros de asesoramiento en los que las personas se responden a las preguntas. Hacer que las personas se proporcionen mutuamente el servicio generalmente aumenta el bienestar social: el individuo que utiliza los recursos del sistema obtiene un beneficio mayor que el costo para la persona que lo proporciona. Sin embargo, el costo de proporcionar servicio aún puede ser no trivial. Por ejemplo, los usuarios de Kazaa y BitTorrent pueden cargarse por el uso de ancho de banda;Además, en algunos sistemas de intercambio de archivos, existe la posibilidad de ser demandado, que puede verse como parte del costo. Por lo tanto, en muchos sistemas hay un fuerte incentivo para convertirse en un jinete libre y beneficiarse del sistema sin contribuir a él. Esto no es simplemente un problema teórico;Los estudios de la red Gnutella [22] han demostrado que casi el 70 por ciento de los usuarios no comparten archivos y casi el 50 por ciento de las respuestas son del 1 por ciento superior de los hosts compartidos [1]. Tener relativamente pocos usuarios proporciona la mayor parte del servicio crea un punto de centralización;La desaparición de un pequeño porcentaje de usuarios puede afectar en gran medida la funcionalidad del sistema. Además, las tendencias actuales parecen estar llevando a la eliminación de los usuarios altruistas en los que dependen estos sistemas. Estos usuarios pesados son algunos de los clientes más caros que tienen los ISP. Por lo tanto, a medida que la cantidad de tráfico ha crecido, los ISP han comenzado a buscar formas de reducir este tráfico. Algunas universidades han comenzado a cobrar a los estudiantes por el uso excesivo de ancho de banda;Otros revocan el acceso a la red para él [5]. Varias compañías también han formado cuyo servicio es detectar el uso excesivo de ancho de banda [19]. Estas tendencias hacen que el desarrollo de un sistema que fomente una distribución más igualitaria del trabajo crítico para la viabilidad continua de las redes P2P y otros sistemas en línea distribuidos. Se ha producido una cantidad significativa de investigación para diseñar sistemas de reputación para brindar un tratamiento preferencial a los usuarios que comparten archivos. Algunas de las redes P2P actualmente en uso han implementado versiones de estas técnicas. Sin embargo, estos enfoques tienden a caer en una de dos categorías: son como trueque o reputales. Por un trueque, nos referimos a que cada agente basa sus decisiones solo en la información que ha derivado de sus propias interacciones. Quizás el ejemplo más conocido de un sistema tipo trueque es BitTorrent, donde los clientes que descargan un archivo intentan encontrar otros clientes con piezas que faltan para que puedan comerciar, creando así una cantidad de trabajo aproximadamente igual. Dado que el trueque está restringido a los usuarios actualmente interesados en un solo archivo, esto funciona bien para archivos populares, pero tiende a tener problemas para mantener la disponibilidad de los menos populares. Un ejemplo de un sistema tipo trueque construido sobre un sistema de intercambio de archivos más tradicional es el sistema de crédito utilizado por EMULE 140 [8]. Cada usuario rastrea su historial de interacciones con otros usuarios y da prioridad a los que ha descargado en el pasado. Sin embargo, en un sistema grande, la probabilidad de que un par de usuarios elegidos al azar hayan interactuado antes es bastante pequeño, por lo que este historial de interacción no será terriblemente útil. Anagnostakis y Greenwald [2] presentan una versión más sofisticada de este enfoque, pero aún parece sufrir problemas similares. Se han realizado varios intentos para proporcionar sistemas de reputación general (por ejemplo, [12, 13, 17, 27]). La idea básica es agregar la experiencia de cada usuarios en un número global para cada individuo que representa intuitivamente la visión de los sistemas de la reputación de los individuos. Sin embargo, estos intentos tienden a sufrir problemas prácticos porque consideran implícitamente a los usuarios como buenos o malos, suponen que los buenos usuarios actuarán de acuerdo con el protocolo especificado y que hay relativamente pocos usuarios malos. Desafortunadamente, si hay formas fáciles de jugar el sistema, una vez que esta información se vuelve ampliamente disponible, es probable que los usuarios racionales lo utilicen. No podemos contar con que solo unos pocos usuarios sean malos (en el sentido de no seguir el protocolo prescrito). Por ejemplo, Kazaa usa una medida de la relación de la cantidad de cargas para el número de descargas para identificar usuarios buenos y malos. Sin embargo, para evitar penalizar a los nuevos usuarios, les dieron a los nuevos usuarios una calificación promedio. Los usuarios descubrieron que podían usar esta calificación relativamente buena para un viaje gratuito durante un tiempo y, una vez que comenzó a ser mal.una discusión y [11] para un análisis formal de este blanqueo). Así, el sistema de reputación de Kazaas es ineficaz. Este es un caso simple de una vulnerabilidad más general de tales sistemas a los ataques de Sybil [6], donde un solo usuario mantiene múltiples identidades y las usa de manera coordinada para obtener un mejor servicio de lo que lo haría. El trabajo reciente ha demostrado que los sistemas de reputación más comunes son vulnerables (en el peor de los casos) a tales ataques [4];Sin embargo, el grado de esta vulnerabilidad aún no está claro. Los análisis de las vulnerabilidades prácticas y la existencia de tales sistemas que son inmunes a tales ataques siguen siendo un área de investigación activa (por ejemplo, [4, 28, 14]). Los sistemas económicos simples basados en un scrip o dinero parecen evitar muchos de estos problemas, son fáciles de implementar y son bastante populares (ver, por ejemplo, [13, 15, 26]). Sin embargo, tienen un conjunto diferente de problemas. Quizás el más común implica determinar la cantidad de dinero en el sistema. En términos generales, si hay muy poco dinero en el sistema en relación con la cantidad de agentes, entonces relativamente pocos usuarios pueden permitirse hacer una solicitud. Por otro lado, si hay demasiado dinero, los usuarios no sentirán la necesidad de responder a una solicitud;Ya tienen suficiente dinero. Un problema relacionado implica manejar a los recién llegados. Si los recién llegados reciben una cantidad positiva de dinero, entonces el sistema está abierto a ataques Sybil. Quizás no sea sorprendente que los sistemas de guiones terminen teniendo que lidiar con problemas económicos estándar como la inflación, las burbujas y los choques [26]. En este artículo, proporcionamos un modelo formal para analizar los sistemas de scrip. Describimos un sistema de guión simple y mostramos que, bajo suposiciones razonables, por cada cantidad fija de dinero, hay un equilibrio NASH no trivial que involucra estrategias de umbral, donde un agente acepta una solicitud si tiene menos de $ K por algún umbral K.1 AN ANEl aspecto interesante de nuestro análisis es que, en equilibrio, la distribución de usuarios con cada cantidad de dinero es la distribución que maximiza la entropía (sujeto a la restricción de oferta monetaria). Esto nos permite calcular la oferta monetaria que maximiza la eficiencia (bienestar social), dado el número de agentes. También conduce a una solución para el problema de tratar con los recién llegados: simplemente asumimos que los nuevos usuarios entran sin dinero y ajustan el precio del servicio (que es equivalente a ajustar la oferta monetaria) para mantener la relación que maximiza la eficiencia. Si bien asumiendo que los nuevos usuarios vengan sin dinero que no funcionarán en todos los entornos, creemos que el enfoque será ampliamente aplicable. En los sistemas donde el objetivo es trabajar, los nuevos usuarios pueden adquirir dinero realizando trabajo. También debería funcionar en el sistema Kazaalike donde un usuario puede entrar con algunos recursos (por ejemplo, una colección privada de MP3). El resto del documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos nuestro modelo formal y observamos que puede usarse para comprender el efecto de los altruistas. En la Sección 3, examinamos lo que sucede en el juego en Nonstrategic Play, si todos los agentes usan la misma estrategia de umbral. Mostramos que, en este caso, el sistema converge rápidamente a una situación en la que la distribución del dinero se caracteriza por la máxima entropía. Usando este análisis, mostramos en la Sección 4 que, bajo suposiciones mínimas, hay un equilibrio de NASH no trivial en el juego donde todos los agentes usan alguna estrategia umbral. Además, mostramos en la Sección 5 que el análisis conduce a una comprensión de cómo elegir la cantidad de dinero en el sistema (o, de manera equivalente, el costo de cumplir una solicitud) para maximizar la eficiencia, y también muestra cómo manejar nuevosusuarios. En la Sección 6, discutimos en qué medida nuestro enfoque puede manejar sybils y colusión. Concluimos en la Sección 7. 2. El modelo para comenzar, formalizamos proporcionar servicio en una red P2P como un juego no cooperativo. A diferencia de gran parte del modelado en esta área, nuestro modelo modelará las interacciones asimétricas en un sistema de intercambio de archivos en el que la coincidencia de los jugadores (aquellos que solicitan un archivo con aquellos que tienen ese archivo en particular) es una parte clave del sistema. Esto está en contraste con mucho trabajo previo que utiliza una coincidencia aleatoria en un dilema de los prisioneros. Dichos modelos se estudiaron en la literatura económica [18, 7] y se aplicaron por primera vez a la reputación en línea en [11];Una aplicación a P2P se encuentra en [9]. Este modelo de coincidencia aleatoria no puede capturar algunos aspectos sobresalientes de una serie de configuraciones importantes. Cuando se realiza una solicitud, generalmente hay muchas personas en la red que pueden satisfacerla (especialmente en una gran red P2P), pero no todas pueden. Por ejemplo, algunas personas pueden no tener el tiempo o los recursos para satisfacer la solicitud. El proceso de RandomMatching ignora el hecho de que algunas personas pueden no ser capaces de satisfacer la solicitud. Presumiblemente, si la persona coincidiera con el solicitante no pudiera satisfacer el partido, tendría que desertar. Además, no captura el hecho de que la decisión sobre si se debe ser voluntario para satisfacer la solicitud debe hacerse antes del proceso de correspondencia, no después. Es decir, el proceso de correspondencia no captura 1, aunque nos referimos a nuestra unidad de scrip como el dólar, estos no son dólares reales ni los vemos como convertibles en dólares.141 El hecho de que si alguien no está dispuesto a satisfacer la solicitud, sin duda habrá otros que puedan satisfacerla. Finalmente, las acciones y los pagos en el juego de dilema de los prisioneros no se corresponden obviamente a las elecciones reales que se pueden hacer. Por ejemplo, no está claro qué deserción por parte del solicitante significa. En nuestro modelo tratamos de lidiar con todos estos problemas. Supongamos que hay N agentes. En cada ronda, un agente se elige uniformemente al azar para hacer una solicitud. El agente de los demás puede satisfacer esta solicitud con probabilidad β> 0 en todo momento, independientemente del comportamiento anterior. El término β está destinado a capturar la probabilidad de que un agente esté ocupado o no tenga los recursos para cumplir con la solicitud. Suponiendo que β es independiente del tiempo no captura la intute de que ser un incapaz de cumplir una solicitud en el momento T puede correlacionarse con no poder cumplirlo en el momento t+1. Creemos que, en sistemas grandes, deberíamos poder eliminar la suposición de independencia, pero lo dejamos para el trabajo futuro. En cualquier caso, aquellos agentes que pueden satisfacer la solicitud deben elegir si se ofrecen o no ser voluntarios para satisfacerla. Si al menos un agente voluntario, el solicitante obtiene un beneficio de 1 Util (el trabajo está hecho) y uno de los voluntarios se elige al azar para cumplir con la solicitud. El agente que cumple la solicitud paga un costo de α <1. Como es estándar en la literatura, suponemos que los agentes descuentan los pagos futuros por un factor de δ por unidad de tiempo. Esto captura la intuición de que un Util ahora vale más que un Utily Mañana, y nos permite calcular la utilidad total derivada de un agente en un juego infinito. Por último, asumimos que con más solicitudes de jugadores viene con más frecuencia. Por lo tanto, suponemos que el tiempo entre rondas es 1/N. Esto captura el hecho de que los sistemas que queremos modelar realmente están procesando muchas solicitudes en paralelo, por lo que esperaríamos que el número de solicitudes concurrentes sea proporcional al número de usuarios.2 Sea G (N, δ, α, β) denotarEste juego con n agentes, un factor de descuento de δ, un costo para satisfacer las solicitudes de α y una probabilidad de poder satisfacer las solicitudes de β. Cuando los últimos dos parámetros no son relevantes, a veces escribimos G (n, δ). Utilizamos la siguiente notación en todo el documento: • PT denota el agente elegido en la ronda T.• bt i ∈ {0, 1} denota si el agente puedo satisfacer la solicitud en la ronda t.Bt i = 1 con probabilidad β> 0 y Bt I es independiente de Bt I para todos t = t.• V t i ∈ {0, 1} denota que el agente es la decisión sobre si se ofrece como voluntario en la ronda t;1 indica voluntariado. V t i está determinado por el agente es la estrategia.• vt ∈ {j |V T J BT J = 1} denota el agente elegido para satisfacer la solicitud. Este agente se elige uniformemente al azar de aquellos que están dispuestos (v t j = 1) y capaces (bt j = 1) para satisfacer la solicitud.• UT I denota agente es utilidad en la ronda t.Un agente estándar es aquel cuya utilidad se determina como se discute en la introducción;A saber, el agente obtiene 2 para N grande, nuestro modelo converge a uno en el que los jugadores realizan solicitudes en tiempo real, y el tiempo entre las solicitudes de un jugador se distribuye exponencialmente con la media 1. Además, el tiempo entre las solicitudes atendidas por un solo jugador también se distribuye exponencialmente.Una utilidad de 1 para una solicitud y utilidad cumplida −α para cumplir con una solicitud. Por lo tanto, si I es un agente estándar, entonces UT i = 8 <: 1 si i = pt y p j = i v t j bt j> 0 −α si i = vt 0 de lo contrario.• ui = p∞ t = 0 Δt/n ut i denota la utilidad total para el agente i. Es el total descontado de agente es utilidad en cada ronda. Tenga en cuenta que el factor de descuento efectivo es Δ1/N ya que un aumento en N conduce a un acortamiento del tiempo entre rondas. Ahora que tenemos un modelo de hacer y satisfacer solicitudes, lo usamos para analizar la conducción gratuita. Tome un altruista para ser alguien que siempre satisface las solicitudes. Agente I podría comportarse racionalmente altruista si el agente es la función de utilidad tiene la siguiente forma, para algunos α> 0: ut i = 8 <: 1 si i = pt y p j = i v t j bt j> 0 α si i = vt 0de lo contrario. Por lo tanto, en lugar de sufrir una pérdida de utilidad al satisfacer una solicitud, un agente deriva una utilidad positiva de satisfacerla. Tal función de utilidad es una representación razonable del placer que algunas personas obtienen del sentido de que proporcionan la música que todos están tocando. Para tales agentes altruistas, interpretar la estrategia que establece V T i = 1 para todo T es dominante. Si bien tener una función de utilidad no estándar podría ser una razón por la que un agente racional podría usar esta estrategia, ciertamente hay otros. Por ejemplo, un usuario ingenuo de software de intercambio de archivos con una buena conexión podría seguir esta estrategia. Todo lo que importa para la siguiente discusión es que hay algunos agentes que usan esta estrategia, por cualquier razón. Como hemos observado, tales usuarios parecen existir en algunos sistemas grandes. Supongamos que nuestro sistema tiene un altruistas. Intuitivamente, si A es moderadamente grande, logrará satisfacer la mayoría de las solicitudes en el sistema, incluso si otros agentes no funcionan. Por lo tanto, hay pocos incentivos para que cualquier otro agente sea voluntario, porque ya está al máximo la ventaja de participar en el sistema. En base a esta intuición, es un cálculo relativamente sencillo para determinar un valor de A que depende solo de α, β y δ, pero no el número N de los jugadores en el sistema, de modo que la estrategia dominante para todos los agentes estándar es Inunca ser voluntario para satisfacer ninguna solicitud (es decir, v t i = 0 para todo t). Proposición 2.1. Existe una A que depende solo de α, β y δ tal que, en G (N, δ, α, β) con al menos un altruistas, no voluntario en cada ronda es una estrategia dominante para todos los agentes estándar. Prueba. Considere la estrategia para un jugador estándar J en presencia de un altruistas. Incluso sin dinero, el jugador J recibirá una solicitud satisfecha con la probabilidad 1 - (1 - β) A solo a través de las acciones de estos altruistas. Por lo tanto, incluso si J se elige para hacer una solicitud en cada ronda, la utilidad esperada más adicional que puede esperar ganar al tener dinero isp∞ k = 1 (1 - β) a ΔK = (1 - β) A /(1- δ). If (1 - β) a /(1 - δ)> α o, de manera equivalente, si a> log1 - β (α (1 - δ)), nunca voluntariado es una estrategia dominante. Considere los siguientes valores razonables para nuestros parámetros: β = .01 (para que cada jugador pueda satisfacer el 1% de las solicitudes), α = .1 (un costo bajo pero no desplegable), δ = .9999/día 142 (quecorresponde a un factor de descuento anual de aproximadamente 0.95), y un promedio de 1 solicitud por día por jugador. Entonces solo necesitamos un> 1145. Si bien este es un gran número, es pequeño en relación con el tamaño de una gran red P2P. Todos los sistemas actuales tienen un grupo de usuarios que se comportan como nuestros altruistas. Esto significa que los intentos de agregar un sistema de reputación además de un sistema P2P existente para influir en los usuarios para que cooperen no tendrán ningún efecto en los usuarios racionales. Para tener una distribución justa del trabajo, estos sistemas deben ser rediseñados fundamentalmente para eliminar el grupo de usuarios altruistas. En cierto sentido, esto no es un problema en absoluto. En un sistema con altruistas, los altruistas son presumiblemente felices, al igual que los agentes estándar, que obtienen casi todas sus solicitudes satisfechas sin tener que hacer ningún trabajo. De hecho, la red P2P actual funciona bastante bien en términos de distribuir contenido a las personas. Sin embargo, como dijimos en la introducción, hay alguna razón para creer que estos altruistas pueden no estar cerca para siempre. Por lo tanto, vale la pena mirar lo que se puede hacer para que estos sistemas funcionen en su ausencia. Para el resto de este documento, suponemos que todos los agentes son estándar e intentan maximizar la utilidad esperada. Estamos interesados en los equilibrios basados en un sistema de scrip. Cada vez que un agente tiene una solicitud satisfecha de que debe pagarle a la persona que lo cumplió con alguna cantidad. Por ahora, suponemos que el pago es fijo;Para simplificar, la cantidad es de $ 1. Denotamos por M la cantidad total de dinero en el sistema. Suponemos que M> 0 (de lo contrario, nadie podrá pagar). En principio, los agentes son libres de adoptar una variedad muy amplia de estrategias. Pueden tomar decisiones basadas en los nombres de otros agentes o usar una estrategia que depende en gran medida de la historia y mezcle estas estrategias libremente. Para ayudar a nuestro análisis, nos gustaría poder restringir nuestra atención a una clase más simple de estrategias. La clase de estrategias que nos interesan es fácil de motivar. La razón intuitiva para querer ganar dinero es atender la posibilidad de que un agente se agote antes de que tenga la oportunidad de ganar más. Por otro lado, un agente racional con mucho hueso no querría trabajar, porque para cuando haya logrado gastar todo su dinero, el Util tendrá menos valor que el costo actual de trabajar. El equilibrio natural entre estos dos es una estrategia umbral. Deje que SK sea la estrategia donde un agente se ofrece como voluntario cada vez que tiene menos de K dólares y no de otra manera. Tenga en cuenta que S0 es la estrategia en la que el agente nunca se ofrece como voluntario. Si bien todos los que juegan S0 son un equilibrio de Nash (a nadie puede hacerlo mejor voluntariamente si nadie más está dispuesto a hacerlo), es poco interesante. Como mostraremos en la Sección 4, es suficiente restringir nuestra atención a esta clase de estrategias. Usamos KT I para denotar la cantidad de agente de dinero que tengo en el momento t.Claramente kt+1 i = kt i a menos que el agente i tenga una solicitud satisfecha, en cuyo caso kt+1 i = kt+1 i - 1 o agente i cumple una solicitud, en cuyo caso kt+1 i = kt+1 i+1. Formalmente, kt + 1 i = 8 <: kt i - 1 si i = pt, p j = i v t j bt j> 0 y kt i> 0 kt i + 1 if i = vt y kt pt> 0 kt i ide lo contrario. La estrategia de umbral SK es la estrategia tal que v t i =  1 si kt pt> 0 y kt i <k 0 de lo contrario.3. El juego bajo el juego no construido antes de considerar el juego estratégico, examinamos lo que sucede en el sistema si todos solo juegan la misma estrategia SK. Nuestro objetivo general es demostrar que hay cierta distribución sobre el dinero (es decir, la fracción de personas con cada cantidad de dinero) de modo que el sistema converge a esta distribución en cierto sentido para ser precisa en breve. Supongamos que todos juegan SK. Por simplicidad, suponga que todos tienen como máximo K dólares. Podemos hacer esta suposición esencialmente sin pérdida de generalidad, ya que si alguien tiene más de K dólares, solo gastará dinero hasta que tenga como máximo K dólares. Después de este punto, nunca adquirirá más que k.Por lo tanto, eventualmente el sistema estará en tal estado. Si m ≥ kN, ningún agente estará dispuesto a trabajar. Por lo tanto, para los propósitos de esta sección suponemos que m <kn. Desde la perspectiva de un solo agente, en el equilibrio (estocástico), el agente está experimentando una caminata aleatoria. Sin embargo, los parámetros de esta caminata aleatoria dependen de los caminatas aleatorias de los otros agentes y es bastante complicado resolverlo directamente. Por lo tanto, consideramos un análisis alternativo basado en la evolución del sistema en su conjunto. Si todos tienen como máximo K dólares, entonces la cantidad de dinero que tiene un agente es un elemento de {0 ,..., k}. Si hay N agentes, entonces el estado del juego se puede describir identificando cuánto dinero tiene cada agente, por lo que podemos representarlo por un elemento de SK, n = {0 ,..., k} {1, ..., n}. Dado que la cantidad total de dinero es constante, no todos estos estados pueden surgir en el juego. Por ejemplo, el estado donde cada jugador tiene $ 0 es imposible de alcanzar en cualquier juego con dinero en el sistema. Sea ms (s) = p i∈ {1 ... n} s (i) denota el montaje total de dinero en el juego en el estado s, donde s (i) es la cantidad de dólares que el agente i tiene en el estado s.Queremos considerar solo aquellos estados donde el dinero total en el sistema es M, a saber, SK, N, M = {S ∈ Sk, N |MS (S) = M}. Bajo el supuesto de que todos los agentes usan la estrategia SK, la evolución del sistema puede tratarse como una cadena de Markov MK, N, M sobre el espacio de estado SK, N, M. Es posible moverse de un estado a otro en una sola ronda si eligiendo un agente en particular para hacer una solicitud y un agente en particular para satisfacerlo, las cantidades de dinero poseidas por cada agente se convierten en las del segundo estado. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de una transición de un estado s a t es 0 a menos que existan dos agentes i y j tal que s (i) = t (i) para todos i /∈ {i, j}, t (i) = s(i) + 1, y t (j) = s (j) - 1. En este caso, la probabilidad de transición de S a T es la probabilidad de que J se elija para gastar un dólar y tenga a alguien dispuesto y capaz de satisfacer su solicitud ((1/n) (1 - (1 - β) | {i |s (i) = k} | −ij) multiplicado por la probabilidad de ser elegido para satisfacer su solicitud (1/(| ({i | s (i) = k} | - ij)). IJ es 0 si J tiene K dólares y 1 de lo contrario (es solo una corrección por el hecho de que J no puede satisfacer su propia solicitud). Deje que ∆k denote el conjunto de distribuciones de probabilidad en {0 ,..., k}. Podemos pensar en un elemento de ∆K que describe la fracción de personas con cada cantidad de dinero. Esta es una forma útil de ver el sistema, ya que generalmente no nos importa quién tiene cada cantidad de dinero, sino solo la fracción de personas que tienen cada cantidad. Como antes, no todos los elementos de ∆K son posibles, dada nuestra restricción de que el monto total de 143 dinero es M. en lugar de pensar en términos de la cantidad total de dinero en el sistema, será más útil pensar en términos deLa cantidad promedio de dinero que tiene cada jugador. Por supuesto, la cantidad total de dinero en un sistema con n agentes es m si la cantidad promedio que tiene cada jugador es m = m/n. Deje que ∆k m denote todas las distribuciones d ∈ ∆K tal que e (d) = m (es decir, pk j = 0 d (j) j = m). Dado un estado s ∈ Sk, n, m, que ds ∈ ∆K m denota la distribución de dinero en s.Nuestro objetivo es mostrar que, si N es grande, entonces hay una distribución d ∗ ∈ ∆K m de tal manera que, con alta probabilidad, la cadena de Markov MK, N, M casi siempre estará en un estado tal que DS está cercaa d ∗. Por lo tanto, los agentes pueden basar sus decisiones sobre qué estrategia usar sobre el supuesto de que estarán en tal estado. De hecho, podemos caracterizar completamente la distribución d ∗. Dada una distribución d ∈ ∆K, Sea h (d) = - x {j: d (j) = 0} d (j) log (d (j)) denota la entropía de d.Si ∆ es un conjunto convexo cerrado de distribuciones, entonces es bien sabido que hay una distribución única en ∆ en la que la función de entropía toma su valor máximo en ∆. Dado que ∆K M se ve fácilmente como un conjunto convexo cerrado de distribuciones, se deduce que hay una distribución única en ∆K m que denotamos d ∗ k, m cuya entropía es mayor que la de todas las demás distribuciones en ∆k m.Ahora mostramos que, para N suficientemente grande, la cadena Markov MK, N, M está casi seguramente en un estado de tal que DS está cerca de D ∗ K, M/N. La declaración es correcta bajo una serie de sentidos de cierre. Para definición, consideramos la distancia euclidiana. Dado> 0, Sk, N, M, denote el conjunto de estados en SK, N, Mn tal que Pk J = 0 | DS (J) - D ∗ K, M | 2 <. Dada una cadena de Markov sobre un espacio de estado S y S ⊆ s, Sea Xt, S, S la variable aleatoria que denota que M está en un estado de S en el tiempo T, cuando se inicia en el estado s.Teorema 3.1. Para todos> 0, todos k, y todos m, existe n tal que para todos los n> n y todos los estados s ∈ Sk, n, mn, existe un tiempo t ∗ (que puede depender de k, n, m,y) tal que para t> t ∗, tenemos pr (xt, s, sk, n, m,)> 1 -. Prueba.(Boceto) Suponga que en algún momento t, PR (XT, S, S) es uniforme para todos los s. Entonces, la probabilidad de estar en un conjunto de estados es solo el tamaño del conjunto dividido por el número total de estados. Una técnica estándar de la mecánica estadística es mostrar que existe un fenómeno de concentración alrededor de la distribución máxima de entropía [16]. Más precisamente, utilizando un argumento combinatorio directo, se puede demostrar que la fracción de estados no en SK, N, M, está limitada por P (N)/ECN, donde P es un polinomio. Esta fracción claramente va a 0 a medida que N se vuelve grande. Por lo tanto, para N suficientemente grande, PR (XT, S, SK, N, M,)> 1 - Si PR (XT, S, S) es uniforme. Es relativamente sencillo mostrar que nuestra cadena Markov tiene una distribución de límite π sobre SK, N, Mn, de modo que para todos S, S ∈ Sk, N, Mn, Limt → ∞ PR (XT, S, S) = πs. Deje que PIJ denote la probabilidad de transición del estado I al estado j. Se verifica fácilmente por un cálculo explícito de las probabilidades de transición de que Pij = PJI para todos los estados I y J. Se deduce inmediatamente de esta simetría que πs = πs, por lo que π es uniforme. Después de una cantidad suficiente de tiempo, la distribución estará lo suficientemente cerca de π, que las probabilidades están nuevamente limitadas por constante, que es suficiente para completar el teorema.0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 Distancia euclidiana 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 Número de pasos Figura 1: Distancia de la distribución de entropía máxima con 1000 agentes.5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 Número de agentes 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 Máxima Distancia Figura 2: Distancia máxima de la distribución de Maximumentropy en 106 TimesPs.0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 Número de agentes 0 20000 40000 60000 Timetodistance.001 Figura 3: Tiempo promedio para obtener .001 de la distribución de entropía máxima.144 Realizamos una serie de experimentos que muestran que el comportamiento máximo de entropía descrito en el Teorema 3.1 surge rápidamente para valores bastante prácticos de N y T.El primer experimento mostró que, incluso si N = 1000, alcanzamos la distribución de entropía máxima rápidamente. Promediamos 10 corridas de la cadena de Markov para k = 5, donde hay suficiente dinero para que cada agente tenga $ 2 a partir de una distribución muy extrema (cada agente tiene $ 0 o $ 5) y consideró el tiempo promedio necesario a varias distancias dela distribución máxima de entropía. Como muestra la Figura 1, después de 2,000 pasos, en promedio, la distancia euclidiana de la distribución promedio de dinero a la distribución de entropía máxima es de .008;Después de 3.000 pasos, la distancia se reduce a .001. Tenga en cuenta que esto es realmente solo 3 unidades en tiempo real, ya que con 1000 jugadores tenemos 1000 transacciones por unidad de tiempo. Luego consideramos qué tan cerca permanece la distribución a la distribución máxima de entropía una vez que la ha alcanzado. Para simplificar las cosas, comenzamos el sistema en un estado cuya distribución estaba muy cerca de la distribución de entropía máxima y la ejecutamos durante 106 pasos, para varios valores de n.Como muestra la Figura 2, el sistema no se mueve lejos de la distribución de entropía máxima una vez que está allí. Por ejemplo, si N = 5000, el sistema nunca es más de la distancia .001 desde la distribución de entropía máxima;Si n = 25, 000, nunca es más de .0002 de la distribución de entropía máxima. Finalmente, consideramos cuán cuidadosamente la rapidez con la que el sistema converge a la distribución de entropía máxima para varios valores de n.Hay aproximadamente estados posibles, por lo que el tiempo de convergencia podría ser bastante grande. Sin embargo, sospechamos que la cadena de Markov que surge aquí es una mezcla rápidamente, lo que significa que convergerá significativamente más rápido (ver [20] para obtener más detalles sobre la mezcla rápida). Creemos que el tiempo realmente necesario es o (n). Este comportamiento se ilustra en la Figura 3, que muestra que para nuestra cadena de ejemplo (nuevamente promediada en 10 corridas), después de pasos 3n, la distancia euclidiana entre la distribución real de dinero en el sistema y la distribución de entropía máxima es inferior a .001.4. El juego bajo juego estratégico hemos visto que el sistema se porta bien si todos los agentes siguen una estrategia umbral;Ahora queremos demostrar que hay un equilibrio de Nash no trivial donde lo hacen (es decir, un equilibrio de Nash donde todos los agentes usan SK para algunos k> 0) Esto no es cierto en general. Si δ es pequeño, entonces los agentes no tienen incentivos para trabajar. Intuitivamente, si la utilidad futura tiene suficiente descuento, entonces todo lo que importa es el presente, y no tiene sentido ser voluntario para trabajar. Con un pequeño δ, S0 es el único equilibrio. Sin embargo, mostramos que para δ lo suficientemente grande, hay otro equilibrio en las estrategias de umbral. Hacemos esto al mostrar primero que, si cualquier otro agente está jugando una estrategia de umbral, entonces hay una mejor respuesta que también es una estrategia de umbral (aunque no necesariamente la misma). Luego mostramos que debe haber alguna estrategia de umbral (mixta) para la cual esta mejor respuesta es la misma estrategia. Se deduce que esta tupla de estrategias de umbral es un equilibrio de Nash. Como primer paso, mostramos que, para todos K, si todos los que no sean agentes I están jugando SK, entonces hay una estrategia de umbral SK que es una mejor respuesta para el Agente I. Para probar esto, debemos suponer que el sistema está cerca de la distribución de estados estadizos (es decir, la distribución de entropía máxima). Sin embargo, mientras δ esté suficientemente cerca de 1, podemos ignorar lo que sucede durante el período de que el sistema no está en estado estacionario.3 Hasta ahora hemos considerado estrategias umbral de la forma SK, donde K es un número natural;Este es un conjunto discreto de estrategias. Para una prueba posterior, será útil tener un conjunto continuo de estrategias. Si γ = K + γ, donde K es un número natural y 0 ≤ γ <1, sea Sγ la estrategia que realiza SK con probabilidad 1 - γ y SK + 1 con probabilidad γ.(Tenga en cuenta que no estamos considerando estrategias arbitrarias de umbral mixto aquí, sino simplemente mezclar entre estrategias adyacentes con el único propósito de distinguir estrategias continuas de manera natural). El teorema 3.1 se aplica a las estrategias Sγ (la misma prueba pasa sin cambios), donde γ es un número real no negativo arbitrario. Teorema 4.1. Arregle una estrategia Sγ y un agente i. Existe δ ∗ <1 y N ∗ de tal manera que si Δ> δ ∗, n> n ∗ y cada agente que no sean jugando sγ en el juego g (n, δ), entonces hay un entero k tal que el mejorLa respuesta para el agente I es SK. O K es único (es decir, hay una mejor respuesta única que también es una estrategia umbral), o existe un entero K de tal manera que Sγ es una mejor respuesta para el Agente I para todos los γ en el intervalo [K, K +1] (y estas son las únicas mejores respuestas entre las estrategias de umbral). Prueba.(Sketch :) Si δ es suficientemente grande, podemos ignorar lo que sucede antes de que el sistema converja a la distribución de maximumentropy. Si N es suficientemente grande, entonces la estrategia jugada por un agente no afectará significativamente la distribución del dinero. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de que me mude de un estado (monto en dólares) a otro depende solo de la estrategia es (ya que podemos tomar la probabilidad de que me elijan hacer una solicitud y la probabilidad de que me elijan para satisfacer una solicitud aser constante). Por lo tanto, desde el punto de vista, el sistema es un proceso de decisión de Markov (MDP), y necesito calcular la política óptima (estrategia) para este MDP. Se deduce de los resultados estándar [23, Teorema 6.11.6] que existe una política óptima que es una política umbral. El argumento de que la mejor respuesta es única o hay un intervalo de las mejores respuestas se deriva de un análisis más cuidadoso de la función de valor para el MDP. Observamos que puede haber las mejores respuestas que no son estrategias de umbral. Todo ese teorema 4.1 muestra que, entre las mejores respuestas, hay al menos una que es una estrategia umbral. Dado que sabemos que hay una mejor respuesta que es una estrategia umbral, podemos buscar un equilibrio de Nash en el espacio de estrategias de umbral. Teorema 4.2. Para todo M, existe δ ∗ <1 y N ∗ de tal manera que si δ> δ ∗ y n> n ∗, existe un equilibrio NASH en el juego g (n, δ) donde todos los agentes juegan Sγ para algunos enteros γ>0. Prueba. Se deduce fácilmente del teorema de prueba 4.1 que si BR (δ, γ) es la estrategia de umbral de mejor respuesta mínima si todos los demás agentes juegan Sγ y el factor de descuento es δ, entonces para δ fijo, br (δ, ·)una función de paso. También sigue a 3 formalmente, necesitamos definir las estrategias cuando el sistema está lejos del equilibrio. Sin embargo, estas estrategias de equilibrio (estocásticas) no afectarán el comportamiento de equilibrio cuando N es grande y las desviaciones del equilibrio son extremadamente raras.145 del teorema de que si hay dos mejores respuestas, entonces una mezcla de ellas también es una mejor respuesta. Por lo tanto, si podemos unir los pasos por una línea vertical, obtenemos una curva de mejor respuesta. Es fácil ver que en todas partes esta curva de respuesta mejor cruza la diagonal Y = X define un equilibrio de Nash donde todos los agentes están utilizando la misma estrategia de umbral. Como ya hemos observado, uno de esos equilibrios ocurre en 0. Si solo hay $ M en el sistema, podemos restringir a las estrategias de umbral SK donde k ≤ m + 1. Como nadie puede tener más de $ M, todas las estrategias SK para K> m son equivalentes a SM;Estas son solo las estrategias en las que el agente siempre es voluntario en respuesta a la solicitud hecha por alguien que puede pagar. Claramente br (δ, sm) ≤ m para todos δ, por lo que la mejor función de respuesta es en o por debajo del equilibrio en M. Si k ≤ m/n, cada jugador tendrá al menos k dólares y, por lo tanto, no estará dispuesto a trabajar yLa mejor respuesta es solo 0. Considere K ∗, la K más pequeña de tal manera que K> m/n. No es difícil demostrar que para k ∗ existe A δ ∗ de tal manera que para todos δ ≥ Δ ∗, br (δ, k ∗) ≥ k ∗. Continuidad se deduce que si δ ≥ δ ∗, debe haber algo de γ tal que Br (δ, γ) = γ. Este es el equilibrio de Nash deseado. Este argumento también nos muestra que en general no podemos esperar que los puntos fijos sean únicos. Si BR (δ, K ∗) = K ∗ y Br (δ, K + 1)> K + 1, entonces nuestro argumento muestra que debe haber un segundo punto fijo. En general, puede haber múltiples puntos fijos incluso cuando BR (δ, k ∗)> k ∗, como se ilustra en la Figura 4 con n = 1000 y M = 3000. 0 5 10 15 20 25 Strategia del resto de agentes 0 5 1015 20 25 Best -Respuesta Figura 4: La mejor función de respuesta para N = 1000 y M = 3000. Teorema 4.2 nos permite restringir nuestro diseño a los agentes que utilizan estrategias de umbral con la confianza de que habrá un equilibrio no trivial. Sin embargo, no descarta la posibilidad de que pueda haber otros equilibrios que no implicen estrategias de umbral. Incluso es posible (aunque parece poco probable) que algunos de estos equilibrios puedan ser mejores.5. Bienestar social y escala Nuestros teoremas muestran que para cada valor de M y N, para δ suficientemente grande, existe un equilibrio NASH no trivial donde todos los agentes usan alguna estrategia umbral Sγ (M, N). Desde el punto de vista del diseñador del sistema, no todos los equilibrios son igualmente buenos;Queremos un equilibrio donde, tan pocos agentes posibles tengan $ 0 cuando tienen la oportunidad de hacer una solicitud (para que puedan pagar la solicitud) y relativamente pocos agentes tienen más que la cantidad umbral de dinero (por lo que siempre hay muchosde agentes para cumplir con la solicitud). Hay una tensión entre estos objetivos. No es difícil demostrar que a medida que la fracción de agentes con $ 0 aumenta en la distribución máxima de entropía, la fracción de agentes con la cantidad máxima de dinero disminuye. Por lo tanto, nuestro objetivo es comprender cuál debería ser la cantidad óptima de dinero en el sistema, dada el número de agentes. Es decir, queremos saber la cantidad de dinero que maximiza la eficiencia, es decir, la utilidad total esperada si todos los agentes usan Sγ (M, N).4 Primero observamos que el equilibrio más eficiente depende solo de la relación de M a N, no en los valores reales de M y N.Teorema 5.1. Existe n ∗ tal que para todos los juegos G (N1, δ) y G (N2, δ) donde N1, N2> N ∗, si M1/N1 = M2/N2, entonces Sγ (M1, N1) = Sγ (M2, n2). Prueba. Arreglar m/n = r.El teorema 3.1 muestra que la distribución de entropía máxima depende solo de k y la relación m/n, no en myn por separado. Por lo tanto, dada R, por cada elección de K, hay una distribución de entropía máxima única DK, r. La mejor respuesta BR (δ, K) depende solo de la distribución DK, R, no M o N.Por lo tanto, el equilibrio NASH depende solo de la relación r.Es decir, para todas las opciones de M y N de tal manera que N es suficientemente grande (de modo que se aplica el Teorema 3.1) y M/N = R, las estrategias de equilibrio son las mismas. A la luz del teorema 5.1, el diseñador del sistema debe asegurarse de que haya suficiente dinero en el sistema para que la relación entre M/N sea óptima. Actualmente estamos explorando exactamente cuál es la relación óptima. Como muestran nuestros resultados muy preliminares para β = 1 en la Figura 5, la relación parece aumentar la monótona en δ, lo que coincide con la intuición de que deberíamos proporcionar a más agentes de pacientes con la oportunidad de ahorrar más dinero. Además, parece ser relativamente suave, lo que sugiere que puede tener una buena solución analítica.0.9 0.91 0.92 0.93 0.94 0.95 tasa de descuento ∆ 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 óptimo de óptimofmn Figura 5: cantidad promedio óptima de dinero para el .25 más cercano para β = 1 comentamos que, en la práctica, puede ser más fácil para el diseñador variar el preciode cumplir con una solicitud en lugar de 4 si hay equilibrios múltiples, tomamos Sγ (M, N) como el equilibrio NASH que tiene más alta eficiencia para M y N fijos.146 inyectando dinero en el sistema. Esto produce el mismo efecto. Por ejemplo, cambiar el costo de cumplir con una solicitud de $ 1 a $ 2 es equivalente a reducir a la mitad la cantidad de dinero que tiene cada agente. Del mismo modo, reducir a la mitad el costo de cumplir con una solicitud es equivalente a duplicar la cantidad de dinero que todos tienen. Con una cantidad fija de dinero M, existe un producto óptimo NC del número de agentes y el costo C de cumplir con una solicitud. El Teorema 5.1 también nos dice cómo lidiar con un grupo dinámico de agentes. Nuestro sistema puede manejar los recién llegados con relativa facilidad: simplemente permítales unirse sin dinero. Esto no les da a los agentes existentes ningún incentivo para irse y volver a unirse como recién llegados. Luego cambiamos el precio de cumplir con una solicitud para que se mantenga la relación óptima. Este método tiene la buena característica de que se puede implementar de manera distribuida;Si todos los nodos en el sistema tienen una buena estimación de N, todos pueden ajustar los precios automáticamente.(Alternativamente, el número de agentes en el sistema se puede publicar en un lugar público). Los enfoques que dependen de ajustar la cantidad de dinero pueden requerir cálculos costosos en todo el sistema (ver [26] para un ejemplo), y deben ajustarse cuidadosamente para evitar crear incentivos para que los agentes manipulen el sistema por el cual esto se hace. Tenga en cuenta que, en principio, la comprensión de que el costo de cumplir una solicitud puede cambiar puede afectar la estrategia de los agentes. Por ejemplo, si un agente espera que aumente el costo, entonces puede querer diferir el voluntariado para cumplir con una solicitud. Sin embargo, si el número de agentes en el sistema siempre está aumentando, entonces el costo siempre disminuye, por lo que nunca hay ninguna ventaja en la espera. Puede haber una ventaja en retrasar una solicitud, pero es mucho más costoso, en términos de costos de espera que en brindar servicio, ya que asumimos que la necesidad de un servicio a menudo está sujeta a costos de espera reales, mientras que la necesidad de suministrar el servicioes simplemente aumentar una oferta monetaria.(Los problemas relacionados se discuten en [10].) En última instancia, esperamos modificar el mecanismo para que el precio de un trabajo se pueda establecer endógenamente dentro del sistema (como en las economías del mundo real), con agentes que ofertan por trabajos en lugar de haber un costo fijo establecido externamente. Sin embargo, aún no hemos explorado los cambios necesarios para implementar este cambio. Por lo tanto, por ahora, suponemos que el costo se establece en función del número de agentes en el sistema (y que no existe la posibilidad de que los agentes satisfagan una solicitud de menos que el costo oficial o de los solicitantes que ofrezcan másque eso).6. Sybils y colusión en un sentido ingenuo, nuestro sistema es esencialmente a prueba de sybil. Para obtener dólares D, sus sybils juntos aún tienen que realizar unidades de trabajo D. Además, dado que los recién llegados ingresan al sistema con $ 0, no hay beneficio de crear nuevos agentes simplemente para aprovechar una dotación inicial. Sin embargo, hay algunas formas menos directas en que un agente podría aprovechar los sybils. Primero, al tener más identidades tendrá una mayor probabilidad de ser elegido para hacer una solicitud. Es fácil ver que esto llevará a que el agente tenga una utilidad total más alta. Sin embargo, esto es solo un artefacto de nuestro modelo. Para que nuestro sistema sea fácil de analizar, hemos asumido que las oportunidades de solicitud llegaron de manera uniforme al azar. En la práctica, se hacen solicitudes para satisfacer un deseo. Nuestro modelo asumió implícitamente que todos los agentes tienen la misma probabilidad de tener un deseo en un momento particular. Tener sybils no debe aumentar la necesidad de satisfacer una solicitud. De hecho, sería razonable suponer que los sybils no realizan solicitudes en absoluto. En segundo lugar, tener Sybils hace que sea más probable que uno de los Sybils sea elegido para cumplir con una solicitud. Esto puede permitir que un usuario aumente su utilidad estableciendo un umbral más bajo;es decir, para usar una estrategia SK donde K es más pequeña que la K utilizada por la estrategia de equilibrio Nash. Intuitivamente, la necesidad de dinero no es tan crítica si el dinero es más fácil de obtener. A diferencia de la primera preocupación, esto parece un problema real. Parece razonable creer que cuando las personas toman una decisión entre varios nodos de satisfacer una solicitud, lo hacen al azar, al menos hasta cierto punto. Incluso si buscan funciones de nodo anunciadas para ayudar a tomar esta decisión, Sybils permitiría a un usuario anunciar una amplia gama de características. En tercer lugar, un agente puede reducir el costo de cumplir con una solicitud al introducir muchos sybils. Del mismo modo, podría aumentar el costo (y, por lo tanto, el valor de su dinero) al hacer que varios sybils abandonen el sistema. De manera consecutiva, podría alternarse entre estas técnicas para magnificar los efectos del trabajo que hace. Todavía no hemos calculado el efecto exacto de este cambio (interactúa con los otros dos efectos de tener sybils que ya hemos señalado). Dado el número de sybils que se necesitarían para causar un cambio real en el tamaño percibido de una gran red P2P, la practicidad de este ataque depende en gran medida de cuánto cuestan sybils a un atacante y qué recursos tiene disponibles. El segundo punto planteado con respecto a los sybils también se aplica a la colusión si permitimos que se presten dinero. Si los agentes K coluden, pueden estar de acuerdo en que, si uno se queda sin dinero, otro en el grupo le prestará dinero. Al agrupar su dinero de esta manera, los agentes K pueden volver a hacerlo mejor estableciendo un umbral más alto. Tenga en cuenta que el mecanismo de préstamo no necesita ser integrado en el sistema;Los agentes simplemente pueden usar una transacción falsa para transferir el dinero. Estas parecen ser las principales vías para los ataques colusivos, pero todavía estamos explorando este problema.7. Conclusión Hemos dado un análisis formal de un sistema de guiones y hemos demostrado que la existencia de un equilibrio de Nash donde todos los agentes usan una estrategia umbral. Además, podemos calcular la eficiencia de la estrategia de equilibrio y optimizar el precio (o la oferta monetaria) para maximizar la eficiencia. Por lo tanto, nuestro análisis proporciona un mecanismos formales para resolver algunos problemas importantes en la implementación de sistemas de scrip. Nos dice que con una población fija de usuarios racionales, es muy poco probable que estos sistemas se vuelvan inestables. Por lo tanto, si esta estabilidad es una creencia común entre los agentes, no esperaríamos inflación, burbujas o accidentes debido a la especulación del agente. Sin embargo, no podemos descartar la posibilidad de que los agentes tengan otras creencias que les hagan especular. Nuestro análisis también nos dice cómo escalar el sistema para manejar una afluencia de nuevos usuarios sin introducir estos problemas: escalar la oferta monetaria para mantener constante la cantidad promedio de dinero (o ajustar de manera equivalente los precios para lograr el mismo objetivo). Hay una serie de cuestiones teóricas que aún están abiertas, incluida una caracterización de la multiplicidad de equilibrios: ¿existen por lo general 2? Además, esperamos que uno pueda calcular las estimaciones analíticas para la mejor función de respuesta y el precio óptimo que nos permitirían comprender la relación entre los precios y los varios parámetros en el modelo.147 También sería de gran interés extender nuestro análisis para manejar configuraciones más realistas. Mencionamos algunas posibles extensiones aquí: • Hemos asumido que el mundo es homogéneo de varias maneras, incluida la frecuencia de solicitud, la utilidad y la capacidad de satisfacer las solicitudes. Sería interesante examinar cuán relajante de estos supuestos alteraría nuestros resultados.• Hemos asumido que no hay costo para un agente para ser miembro del sistema. En cambio, supongamos que impusimos un pequeño costo simplemente por estar presente en el sistema para reflejar los costos de los mensajes de enrutamiento y el mantenimiento de la superposición. Esta modificación podría tener un impacto significativo en los ataques de Sybil.• Hemos descrito un sistema de guiones que funciona cuando no hay altruistas y hemos demostrado que ningún sistema puede funcionar una vez que hay suficientes altruistas. ¿Qué sucede entre estos extremos?• Un tipo de comportamiento irracional encontrado con los sistemas de scrip es el acaparamiento. Hay algunas similitudes entre el acaparamiento y el comportamiento altruista. Mientras que un altruista brinda servicio a todos, un acaparador se ofrecerá como voluntario para todos los trabajos (para obtener más dinero) y rara vez solicitará servicio (para no gastar dinero). Sería interesante investigar en qué medida nuestro sistema es robusto contra los acaparadores. Claramente, con demasiados acaparadores, puede que no quede suficiente dinero entre los no hurtadores para garantizar que, por lo general, un no ganador tendrá suficiente dinero para satisfacer una solicitud.• Finalmente, en los sistemas de archivo de archivos P2P, hay comunidades superpuestas de varios tamaños que tienen mucho más probabilidades de satisfacer las solicitudes de los demás. Sería interesante investigar el efecto de tales comunidades en el equilibrio de nuestro sistema. También hay una serie de problemas de implementación que tendrían que resolverse en un sistema real. Por ejemplo, debemos preocuparnos por la posibilidad de que los agentes falsifiquen el dinero o mientan si realmente se brindó el servicio. Karma [26] Provdes Techniques para lidiar con ambos problemas y varios otros, pero algunas de las decisiones de implementación de Karmas apuntan a problemas para nuestro modelo. Por ejemplo, es prohibitivamente costoso garantizar que los saldos de la cuenta bancaria nunca puedan ser negativos, un hecho de que nuestro modelo no captura. Otro ejemplo es que el karma tiene nodos que sirven como contables para otros saldos de cuentas de nodos. Al igual que mantener una presencia en la red, esto impone un costo en el nodo, pero a diferencia de eso, la responsabilidad puede ser fácilmente trasero. Karma sugiere varias formas de incentivar los nodos para realizar estos deberes. No hemos investigado si estos mecanismos se incorporan sin perturbar nuestro equilibrio.8.

        "It is shown that by adding a scrip system, a mechanism that admits a reasonable Nash equilibrium that reduces free riding can be obtained.",
        "The effect of varying the total amount of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfare) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized.",
        "The work has implications for many online systems, not only P2P networks but also a wide variety of online forums for which scrip systems are popular, but formal analyses have been lacking.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors C.2.4 [Computer-Communication Networks]: Distributed Systems; I.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Multiagent systems; J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics; K.4.4 [Computers and Society]: Electronic Commerce General Terms Economics, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
        "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
        "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
        "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
        "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
        "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
        "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
        "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
        "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
        "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
        "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
        "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
        "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
        "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
        "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
        "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
        "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
        "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
        "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
        "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
        "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
        "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
        "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
        "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
        "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
        "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
        "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
        "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
        "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
        "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
        "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
        "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
        "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
        "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
        "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
        "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
        "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
        "However, they have a different set of problems.",
        "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
        "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
        "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
        "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
        "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
        "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
        "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
        "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
        "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
        "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
        "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
        "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
        "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
        "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
        "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
        "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
        "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
        "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
        "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
        "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
        "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
        "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
        "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
        "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
        "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
        "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
        "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
        "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
        "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
        "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
        "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
        "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
        "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
        "Suppose that there are n agents.",
        "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
        "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
        "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
        "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
        "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
        "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
        "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
        "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
        "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
        "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
        "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
        "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
        "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
        "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
        "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",
        "V t i is determined by agent is strategy. • vt ∈ {j | V t j Bt j = 1} denotes the agent chosen to satisfy the request.",
        "This agent is chosen uniformly at random from those who are willing (V t j = 1) and able (Bt j = 1) to satisfy the request. • ut i denotes agent is utility in round t. A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a players requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1.",
        "In addition, the time between requests served by a single player is also exponentially distributed. a utility of 1 for a fulfilled request and utility −α for fulfilling a request.",
        "Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise. • Ui = P∞ t=0 δt/n ut i denotes the total utility for agent i.",
        "It is the discounted total of agent is utility in each round.",
        "Note that the effective discount factor is δ1/n since an increase in n leads to a shortening of the time between rounds.",
        "Now that we have a model of making and satisfying requests, we use it to analyze free riding.",
        "Take an altruist to be someone who always fulfills requests.",
        "Agent i might rationally behave altruistically if agent is utility function has the following form, for some α > 0: ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 α if i = vt 0 otherwise.",
        "Thus, rather than suffering a loss of utility when satisfying a request, an agent derives positive utility from satisfying it.",
        "Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing.",
        "For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant.",
        "While having a nonstandard utility function might be one reason that a rational agent might use this strategy, there are certainly others.",
        "For example a naive user of filesharing software with a good connection might well follow this strategy.",
        "All that matters for the following discussion is that there are some agents that use this strategy, for whatever reason.",
        "As we have observed, such users seem to exist in some large systems.",

        "Intuitively, if a is moderately large, they will manage to satisfy most of the requests in the system even if other agents do no work.",
        "Thus, there is little incentive for any other agent to volunteer, because he is already getting full advantage of participating in the system.",
        "Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t).",
        "Proposition 2.1.",
        "There exists an a that depends only on α, β, and δ such that, in G(n, δ, α, β) with at least a altruists, not volunteering in every round is a dominant strategy for all standard agents.",
        "Proof.",
        "Consider the strategy for a standard player j in the presence of a altruists.",
        "Even with no money, player j will get a request satisfied with probability 1 − (1 − β)a just through the actions of these altruists.",
        "Thus, even if j is chosen to make a request in every round, the most additional expected utility he can hope to gain by having money isP∞ k=1(1 − β)a δk = (1 − β)a /(1 − δ).",
        "If (1 − β)a /(1 − δ) > α or, equivalently, if a > log1−β(α(1 − δ)), never volunteering is a dominant strategy.",
        "Consider the following reasonable values for our parameters: β = .01 (so that each player can satisfy 1% of the requests), α = .1 (a low but non-negligible cost), δ = .9999/day 142 (which corresponds to a yearly discount factor of approximately 0.95), and an average of 1 request per day per player.",
        "Then we only need a > 1145.",
        "While this is a large number, it is small relative to the size of a large P2P network.",
        "Current systems all have a pool of users behaving like our altruists.",
        "This means that attempts to add a reputation system on top of an existing P2P system to influence users to cooperate will have no effect on rational users.",
        "To have a fair distribution of work, these systems must be fundamentally redesigned to eliminate the pool of altruistic users.",
        "In some sense, this is not a problem at all.",
        "In a system with altruists, the altruists are presumably happy, as are the standard agents, who get almost all their requests satisfied without having to do any work.",
        "Indeed, current P2P network work quite well in terms of distributing content to people.",

        "The intuitive reason for wanting to earn money is to cater for the possibility that an agent will run out before he has a chance to earn more.",
        "On the other hand, a rational agent with plenty of mone would not want to work, because by the time he has managed to spend all his money, the util will have less value than the present cost of working.",

        "We use Kt i to denote the amount of money agent i has at time t. Clearly Kt+1 i = Kt i unless agent i has a request satisfied, in which case Kt+1 i = Kt+1 i − 1 or agent i fulfills a request, in which case Kt+1 i = Kt+1 i + 1.",

        "For simplicity, assume that everyone has at most k dollars.",
        "We can make this assumption with essentially no loss of generality, since if someone has more than k dollars, he will just spend money until he has at most k dollars.",
        "After this point he will never acquire more than k. Thus, eventually the system will be in such a state.",
        "If M ≥ kn, no agent will ever be willing to work.",
        "Thus, for the purposes of this section we assume that M < kn.",
        "From the perspective of a single agent, in (stochastic) equilibrium, the agent is undergoing a random walk.",
        "However, the parameters of this random walk depend on the random walks of the other agents and it is quite complicated to solve directly.",

        "If there are n agents, then the state of the game can be described by identifying how much money each agent has, so we can represent it by an element of Sk,n = {0, . . . , k}{1,...,n} .",
        "Since the total amount of money is constant, not all of these states can arise in the game.",
        "For example the state where each player has $0 is impossible to reach in any game with money in the system.",
        "Let mS(s) = P i∈{1...n} s(i) denote the total mount of money in the game at state s, where s(i) is the number of dollars that agent i has in state s. We want to consider only those states where the total money in the system is M, namely Sk,n,M = {s ∈ Sk,n | mS(s) = M}.",
        "Under the assumption that all agents use strategy Sk, the evolution of the system can be treated as a Markov chain Mk,n,M over the state space Sk,n,M .",
        "It is possible to move from one state to another in a single round if by choosing a particular agent to make a request and a particular agent to satisfy it, the amounts of money possesed by each agent become those in the second state.",

        "To prove this, we need to assume that the system is close to the steadystate distribution (i.e., the maximum-entropy distribution).",
        "However, as long as δ is sufficiently close to 1, we can ignore what happens during the period that the system is not in steady state.3 We have thus far considered threshold strategies of the form Sk, where k is a natural number; this is a discrete set of strategies.",

        "We ultimately hope to modify the mechanism so that the price of a job can be set endogenously within the system (as in real-world economies), with agents bidding for jobs rather than there being a fixed cost set externally.",
        "However, we have not yet explored the changes required to implement this change.",
        "Thus, for now, we assume that the cost is set as a function of the number of agents in the system (and that there is no possibility for agents to satisfy a request for less than the official cost or for requesters to offer to pay more than it). 6.",
        "SYBILS AND COLLUSION In a naive sense, our system is essentially sybil-proof.",
        "To get d dollars, his sybils together still have to perform d units of work.",
        "Moreover, since newcomers enter the system with $0, there is no benefit to creating new agents simply to take advantage of an initial endowment.",
        "Nevertheless, there are some less direct ways that an agent could take advantage of sybils.",
        "First, by having more identities he will have a greater probability of getting chosen to make a request.",
        "It is easy to see that this will lead to the agent having higher total utility.",
        "However, this is just an artifact of our model.",
        "To make our system simple to analyze, we have assumed that request opportunities came uniformly at random.",
        "In practice, requests are made to satisfy a desire.",
        "Our model implicitly assumed that all agents are equally likely to have a desire at any particular time.",
        "Having sybils should not increase the need to have a request satisfied.",
        "Indeed, it would be reasonable to assume that sybils do not make requests at all.",
        "Second, having sybils makes it more likely that one of the sybils will be chosen to fulfill a request.",
        "This can allow a user to increase his utility by setting a lower threshold; that is, to use a strategy Sk where k is smaller than the k used by the Nash equilibrium strategy.",
        "Intuitively, the need for money is not as critical if money is easier to obtain.",
        "Unlike the first concern, this seems like a real issue.",
        "It seems reasonable to believe that when people make a decision between a number of nodes to satisfy a request they do so at random, at least to some extent.",
        "Even if they look for advertised node features to help make this decision, sybils would allow a user to advertise a wide range of features.",
        "Third, an agent can drive down the cost of fulfilling a request by introducing many sybils.",
        "Similarly, he could increase the cost (and thus the value of his money) by making a number of sybils leave the system.",
        "Concievably he could alternate between these techniques to magnify the effects of work he does.",
        "We have not yet calculated the exact effect of this change (it interacts with the other two effects of having sybils that we have already noted).",
        "Given the number of sybils that would be needed to cause a real change in the perceived size of a large P2P network, the practicality of this attack depends heavily on how much sybils cost an attacker and what resources he has available.",
        "The second point raised regarding sybils also applies to collusion if we allow money to be loaned.",
        "If k agents collude, they can agree that, if one runs out of money, another in the group will loan him money.",
        "By pooling their money in this way, the k agents can again do better by setting a higher threshold.",
        "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",
        "These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.",
        "Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.",
        "Thus, our analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems.",
        "It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.",
        "Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.",
        "However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.",
        "Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).",
        "There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2?",
        "In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.",
        "We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.",
        "It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.",
        "Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.",
        "This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists.",
        "What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.",
        "There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.",
        "While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).",
        "It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.",
        "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",
        "It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.",
        "There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.",
        "For example, we need to worry about the possibility of agents counterfeiting money or lying about whether service was actually provided.",
        "Karma [26] provdes techniques for dealing with both of these issues and a number of others, but some of Karmas implementation decisions point to problems for our model.",
        "For example, it is prohibitively expensive to ensure that bank account balances can never go negative, a fact that our model does not capture.",
        "Another example is that Karma has nodes serve as bookkeepers for other nodes account balances.",
        "Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked.",
        "Karma suggests several ways to incentivize nodes to perform these duties.",
        "We have not investigated whether these mechanisms be incorporated without disturbing our equilibrium. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial <br>nash equilibrium</br> involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial <br>nash equilibrium</br> in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a <br>p2p network</br> as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large <br>p2p network</br>), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",

                "Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise. • Ui = P∞ t=0 δt/n ut i denotes the total utility for agent i.",
                "It is the discounted total of agent is utility in each round.",
                "Note that the effective discount factor is δ1/n since an increase in n leads to a shortening of the time between rounds.",
                "Now that we have a model of making and satisfying requests, we use it to analyze free riding.",
                "Take an altruist to be someone who always fulfills requests.",
                "Agent i might rationally behave altruistically if agent is utility function has the following form, for some α > 0: ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 α if i = vt 0 otherwise.",
                "Thus, rather than suffering a loss of utility when satisfying a request, an agent derives positive utility from satisfying it.",
                "Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing.",
                "For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant.",
                "While having a nonstandard utility function might be one reason that a rational agent might use this strategy, there are certainly others.",
                "For example a naive user of filesharing software with a good connection might well follow this strategy.",
                "All that matters for the following discussion is that there are some agents that use this strategy, for whatever reason.",
                "As we have observed, such users seem to exist in some large systems.",
                "Suppose that our system has a altruists.",

                "Thus, there is little incentive for any other agent to volunteer, because he is already getting full advantage of participating in the system.",
                "Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t).",
                "Proposition 2.1.",
                "There exists an a that depends only on α, β, and δ such that, in G(n, δ, α, β) with at least a altruists, not volunteering in every round is a dominant strategy for all standard agents.",

                "As our very preliminary results for β = 1 show in Figure 5, the ratio appears to be monotone increasing in δ, which matches the intuition that we should provide more patient agents with the opportunity to save more money.",

                "Our system can handle newcomers relatively easily: simply allow them to join with no money.",
                "This gives existing agents no incentive to leave and rejoin as newcomers.",
                "We then change the price of fulfilling a request so that the optimal ratio is maintained.",
                "This method has the nice feature that it can be implemented in a distributed fashion; if all nodes in the system have a good estimate of n then they can all adjust prices automatically. (Alternatively, the number of agents in the system can be posted in a public place.)",
                "Approaches that rely on adjusting the amount of money may require expensive system-wide computations (see [26] for an example), and must be carefully tuned to avoid creating incentives for agents to manipulate the system by which this is done.",
                "Note that, in principle, the realization that the cost of fulfilling a request can change can affect an agents strategy.",
                "For example, if an agent expects the cost to increase, then he may want to defer volunteering to fulfill a request.",
                "However, if the number of agents in the system is always increasing, then the cost always decreases, so there is never any advantage in waiting.",
                "There may be an advantage in delaying a request, but it is far more costly, in terms of waiting costs than in providing service, since we assume the need for a service is often subject to real waiting costs, while the need to supply the service is merely to augment a money supply. (Related issues are discussed in [10].)",
                "We ultimately hope to modify the mechanism so that the price of a job can be set endogenously within the system (as in real-world economies), with agents bidding for jobs rather than there being a fixed cost set externally.",
                "However, we have not yet explored the changes required to implement this change.",
                "Thus, for now, we assume that the cost is set as a function of the number of agents in the system (and that there is no possibility for agents to satisfy a request for less than the official cost or for requesters to offer to pay more than it). 6.",

                "To get d dollars, his sybils together still have to perform d units of work.",
                "Moreover, since newcomers enter the system with $0, there is no benefit to creating new agents simply to take advantage of an initial endowment.",
                "Nevertheless, there are some less direct ways that an agent could take advantage of sybils.",
                "First, by having more identities he will have a greater probability of getting chosen to make a request.",
                "It is easy to see that this will lead to the agent having higher total utility.",
                "However, this is just an artifact of our model.",
                "To make our system simple to analyze, we have assumed that request opportunities came uniformly at random.",
                "In practice, requests are made to satisfy a desire.",
                "Our model implicitly assumed that all agents are equally likely to have a desire at any particular time.",
                "Having sybils should not increase the need to have a request satisfied.",
                "Indeed, it would be reasonable to assume that sybils do not make requests at all.",
                "Second, having sybils makes it more likely that one of the sybils will be chosen to fulfill a request.",
                "This can allow a user to increase his utility by setting a lower threshold; that is, to use a strategy Sk where k is smaller than the k used by the Nash equilibrium strategy.",
                "Intuitively, the need for money is not as critical if money is easier to obtain.",
                "Unlike the first concern, this seems like a real issue.",
                "It seems reasonable to believe that when people make a decision between a number of nodes to satisfy a request they do so at random, at least to some extent.",
                "Even if they look for advertised node features to help make this decision, sybils would allow a user to advertise a wide range of features.",
                "Third, an agent can drive down the cost of fulfilling a request by introducing many sybils.",
                "Similarly, he could increase the cost (and thus the value of his money) by making a number of sybils leave the system.",
                "Concievably he could alternate between these techniques to magnify the effects of work he does.",
                "We have not yet calculated the exact effect of this change (it interacts with the other two effects of having sybils that we have already noted).",
                "Given the number of sybils that would be needed to cause a real change in the perceived size of a large <br>p2p network</br>, the practicality of this attack depends heavily on how much sybils cost an attacker and what resources he has available.",
                "The second point raised regarding sybils also applies to collusion if we allow money to be loaned.",
                "If k agents collude, they can agree that, if one runs out of money, another in the group will loan him money.",
                "By pooling their money in this way, the k agents can again do better by setting a higher threshold.",
                "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",
                "These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.",
                "Thus, our analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems.",
                "It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.",
                "Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.",
                "However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.",
                "Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).",
                "There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2?",
                "In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.",
                "We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.",
                "It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.",
                "Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.",
                "This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists.",
                "What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.",
                "There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.",
                "While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.",
                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.",
                "There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.",

                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",

A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a players requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1.",

                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or <br>bittorrent</br> [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and <br>bittorrent</br> may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is <br>bittorrent</br>, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t.

                "This can allow a user to increase his utility by setting a lower threshold; that is, to use a strategy Sk where k is smaller than the k used by the Nash equilibrium strategy.",
                "Intuitively, the need for money is not as critical if money is easier to obtain.",
                "Unlike the first concern, this seems like a real issue.",
                "It seems reasonable to believe that when people make a decision between a number of nodes to satisfy a request they do so at random, at least to some extent.",
                "Even if they look for advertised node features to help make this decision, sybils would allow a user to advertise a wide range of features.",
                "Third, an agent can drive down the cost of fulfilling a request by introducing many sybils.",
                "Similarly, he could increase the cost (and thus the value of his money) by making a number of sybils leave the system.",

                "We have not yet calculated the exact effect of this change (it interacts with the other two effects of having sybils that we have already noted).",
                "Given the number of sybils that would be needed to cause a real change in the perceived size of a large P2P network, the practicality of this attack depends heavily on how much sybils cost an attacker and what resources he has available.",

                "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",

                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",

                "The effect of varying the total amount of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfare) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized.",
                "The work has implications for many online systems, not only P2P networks but also a wide variety of online forums for which scrip systems are popular, but formal analyses have been lacking.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by <br>emule</br> 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",
                "V t i is determined by agent is strategy. • vt ∈ {j | V t j Bt j = 1} denotes the agent chosen to satisfy the request.",
                "This agent is chosen uniformly at random from those who are willing (V t j = 1) and able (Bt j = 1) to satisfy the request. • ut i denotes agent is utility in round t. A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a players requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1.",
                "In addition, the time between requests served by a single player is also exponentially distributed. a utility of 1 for a fulfilled request and utility −α for fulfilling a request.",
                "Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise. • Ui = P∞ t=0 δt/n ut i denotes the total utility for agent i.",
                "It is the discounted total of agent is utility in each round.",
                "Note that the effective discount factor is δ1/n since an increase in n leads to a shortening of the time between rounds.",
                "Now that we have a model of making and satisfying requests, we use it to analyze free riding.",
                "Take an altruist to be someone who always fulfills requests.",
                "Agent i might rationally behave altruistically if agent is utility function has the following form, for some α > 0: ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 α if i = vt 0 otherwise.",
                "Thus, rather than suffering a loss of utility when satisfying a request, an agent derives positive utility from satisfying it.",
                "Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing.",
                "For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant.",
                "While having a nonstandard utility function might be one reason that a rational agent might use this strategy, there are certainly others.",
                "For example a naive user of filesharing software with a good connection might well follow this strategy.",
                "All that matters for the following discussion is that there are some agents that use this strategy, for whatever reason.",
                "As we have observed, such users seem to exist in some large systems.",
                "Suppose that our system has a altruists.",
                "Intuitively, if a is moderately large, they will manage to satisfy most of the requests in the system even if other agents do no work.",
                "Thus, there is little incentive for any other agent to volunteer, because he is already getting full advantage of participating in the system.",
                "Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t).",
                "Proposition 2.1.",
                "There exists an a that depends only on α, β, and δ such that, in G(n, δ, α, β) with at least a altruists, not volunteering in every round is a dominant strategy for all standard agents.",
                "Proof.",
                "Consider the strategy for a standard player j in the presence of a altruists.",
                "Even with no money, player j will get a request satisfied with probability 1 − (1 − β)a just through the actions of these altruists.",
                "Thus, even if j is chosen to make a request in every round, the most additional expected utility he can hope to gain by having money isP∞ k=1(1 − β)a δk = (1 − β)a /(1 − δ).",
                "If (1 − β)a /(1 − δ) > α or, equivalently, if a > log1−β(α(1 − δ)), never volunteering is a dominant strategy.",
                "Consider the following reasonable values for our parameters: β = .01 (so that each player can satisfy 1% of the requests), α = .1 (a low but non-negligible cost), δ = .9999/day 142 (which corresponds to a yearly discount factor of approximately 0.95), and an average of 1 request per day per player.",
                "Then we only need a > 1145.",
                "While this is a large number, it is small relative to the size of a large P2P network.",
                "Current systems all have a pool of users behaving like our altruists.",
                "This means that attempts to add a reputation system on top of an existing P2P system to influence users to cooperate will have no effect on rational users.",
                "To have a fair distribution of work, these systems must be fundamentally redesigned to eliminate the pool of altruistic users.",
                "In some sense, this is not a problem at all.",
                "In a system with altruists, the altruists are presumably happy, as are the standard agents, who get almost all their requests satisfied without having to do any work.",
                "Indeed, current P2P network work quite well in terms of distributing content to people.",
                "However, as we said in the introduction, there is some reason to believe these altruists may not be around forever.",
                "Thus, it is worth looking at what can be done to make these systems work in their absence.",
                "For the rest of this paper we assume that all agents are standard, and try to maximize expected utility.",
                "We are interested in equilibria based on a scrip system.",
                "Each time an agent has a request satisfied he must pay the person who satisfied it some amount.",

                "We denote by M the total amount of money in the system.",
                "We assume that M > 0 (otherwise no one will ever be able to get paid).",
                "In principle, agents are free to adopt a very wide variety of strategies.",
                "They can make decisions based on the names of other agents or use a strategy that is heavily history dependant, and mix these strategies freely.",
                "To aid our analysis, we would like to be able to restrict our attention to a simpler class of strategies.",
                "The class of strategies we are interested in is easy to motivate.",
                "The intuitive reason for wanting to earn money is to cater for the possibility that an agent will run out before he has a chance to earn more.",
                "On the other hand, a rational agent with plenty of mone would not want to work, because by the time he has managed to spend all his money, the util will have less value than the present cost of working.",

                "The second point raised regarding sybils also applies to collusion if we allow money to be loaned.",
                "If k agents collude, they can agree that, if one runs out of money, another in the group will loan him money.",
                "By pooling their money in this way, the k agents can again do better by setting a higher threshold.",
                "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",
                "These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.",
                "Thus, our analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems.",
                "It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.",
                "Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.",
                "However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.",
                "Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).",
                "There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2?",
                "In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.",
                "We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.",
                "It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.",
                "Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.",
                "This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists.",
                "What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.",
                "There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.",
                "While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.",
                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.",
                "There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.",
                "For example, we need to worry about the possibility of agents counterfeiting money or lying about whether service was actually provided.",
                "Karma [26] provdes techniques for dealing with both of these issues and a number of others, but some of Karmas implementation decisions point to problems for our model.",
                "For example, it is prohibitively expensive to ensure that bank account balances can never go negative, a fact that our model does not capture.",
                "Another example is that Karma has nodes serve as bookkeepers for other nodes account balances.",
                "Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked.",

                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",

                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each <br>agent</br> bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",

                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",

                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an <br>agent</br> accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the <br>social welfare</br>: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",

                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",

                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",

                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",

                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the <br>game</br> under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the <br>game</br> where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative <br>game</br>.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma <br>game</br> do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite <br>game</br>.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this <br>game</br> with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",

                "For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant.",

                "This method has the nice feature that it can be implemented in a distributed fashion; if all nodes in the system have a good estimate of n then they can all adjust prices automatically. (Alternatively, the number of agents in the system can be posted in a public place.)",
                "Approaches that rely on adjusting the amount of money may require expensive system-wide computations (see [26] for an example), and must be carefully tuned to avoid creating incentives for agents to manipulate the system by which this is done.",
                "Note that, in principle, the realization that the cost of fulfilling a request can change can affect an agents strategy.",
                "For example, if an agent expects the cost to increase, then he may want to defer volunteering to fulfill a request.",
                "However, if the number of agents in the system is always increasing, then the cost always decreases, so there is never any advantage in waiting.",
                "There may be an advantage in delaying a request, but it is far more costly, in terms of waiting costs than in providing service, since we assume the need for a service is often subject to real waiting costs, while the need to supply the service is merely to augment a money supply. (Related issues are discussed in [10].)",
                "We ultimately hope to modify the mechanism so that the price of a job can be set endogenously within the system (as in real-world economies), with agents bidding for jobs rather than there being a fixed cost set externally.",

                "This can allow a user to increase his utility by setting a lower threshold; that is, to use a strategy Sk where k is smaller than the k used by the Nash equilibrium strategy.",
                "Intuitively, the need for money is not as critical if money is easier to obtain.",
                "Unlike the first concern, this seems like a real issue.",
                "It seems reasonable to believe that when people make a decision between a number of nodes to satisfy a request they do so at random, at least to some extent.",
                "Even if they look for advertised node features to help make this decision, sybils would allow a user to advertise a wide range of features.",
                "Third, an agent can drive down the cost of fulfilling a request by introducing many sybils.",
                "Similarly, he could increase the cost (and thus the value of his money) by making a number of sybils leave the system.",
                "Concievably he could alternate between these techniques to magnify the effects of work he does.",
                "We have not yet calculated the exact effect of this change (it interacts with the other two effects of having sybils that we have already noted).",
                "Given the number of sybils that would be needed to cause a real change in the perceived size of a large P2P network, the practicality of this attack depends heavily on how much sybils cost an attacker and what resources he has available.",
                "The second point raised regarding sybils also applies to collusion if we allow money to be loaned.",
                "If k agents collude, they can agree that, if one runs out of money, another in the group will loan him money.",
                "By pooling their money in this way, the k agents can again do better by setting a higher threshold.",
                "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",
                "These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.",

                "It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.",
                "Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.",
                "However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.",
                "Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).",
                "There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2?",
                "In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.",
                "We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.",
                "It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.",
                "Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.",
                "This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists.",
                "What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.",
                "There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.",
                "While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.",
                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.",

                "The effect of varying the total amount of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfare) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized.",
                "The work has implications for many online systems, not only P2P networks but also a wide variety of online forums for which scrip systems are popular, but formal analyses have been lacking.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",
                "Thus, in many systems there is a strong incentive to become a free rider and benefit from the system without contributing to it.",
                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by <br>maximum entropy</br>.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",
                "V t i is determined by agent is strategy. • vt ∈ {j | V t j Bt j = 1} denotes the agent chosen to satisfy the request.",
                "This agent is chosen uniformly at random from those who are willing (V t j = 1) and able (Bt j = 1) to satisfy the request. • ut i denotes agent is utility in round t. A standard agent is one whose utility is determined as discussed in the introduction; namely, the agent gets 2 For large n, our model converges to one in which players make requests in real time, and the time between a players requests are exponentially distributed with mean 1.",
                "In addition, the time between requests served by a single player is also exponentially distributed. a utility of 1 for a fulfilled request and utility −α for fulfilling a request.",
                "Thus, if i is a standard agent, then ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 −α if i = vt 0 otherwise. • Ui = P∞ t=0 δt/n ut i denotes the total utility for agent i.",
                "It is the discounted total of agent is utility in each round.",
                "Note that the effective discount factor is δ1/n since an increase in n leads to a shortening of the time between rounds.",
                "Now that we have a model of making and satisfying requests, we use it to analyze free riding.",
                "Take an altruist to be someone who always fulfills requests.",
                "Agent i might rationally behave altruistically if agent is utility function has the following form, for some α > 0: ut i = 8 < : 1 if i = pt and P j=i V t j Bt j > 0 α if i = vt 0 otherwise.",
                "Thus, rather than suffering a loss of utility when satisfying a request, an agent derives positive utility from satisfying it.",
                "Such a utility function is a reasonable representation of the pleasure that some people get from the sense that they provide the music that everyone is playing.",
                "For such altruistic agents, playing the strategy that sets V t i = 1 for all t is dominant.",
                "While having a nonstandard utility function might be one reason that a rational agent might use this strategy, there are certainly others.",
                "For example a naive user of filesharing software with a good connection might well follow this strategy.",
                "All that matters for the following discussion is that there are some agents that use this strategy, for whatever reason.",
                "As we have observed, such users seem to exist in some large systems.",
                "Suppose that our system has a altruists.",
                "Intuitively, if a is moderately large, they will manage to satisfy most of the requests in the system even if other agents do no work.",
                "Thus, there is little incentive for any other agent to volunteer, because he is already getting full advantage of participating in the system.",
                "Based on this intuition, it is a relatively straightforward calculation to determine a value of a that depends only on α, β, and δ, but not the number n of players in the system, such that the dominant strategy for all standard agents i is to never volunteer to satisfy any requests (i.e., V t i = 0 for all t).",
                "Proposition 2.1.",
                "There exists an a that depends only on α, β, and δ such that, in G(n, δ, α, β) with at least a altruists, not volunteering in every round is a dominant strategy for all standard agents.",
                "Proof.",
                "Consider the strategy for a standard player j in the presence of a altruists.",
                "Even with no money, player j will get a request satisfied with probability 1 − (1 − β)a just through the actions of these altruists.",
                "Thus, even if j is chosen to make a request in every round, the most additional expected utility he can hope to gain by having money isP∞ k=1(1 − β)a δk = (1 − β)a /(1 − δ).",
                "If (1 − β)a /(1 − δ) > α or, equivalently, if a > log1−β(α(1 − δ)), never volunteering is a dominant strategy.",
                "Consider the following reasonable values for our parameters: β = .01 (so that each player can satisfy 1% of the requests), α = .1 (a low but non-negligible cost), δ = .9999/day 142 (which corresponds to a yearly discount factor of approximately 0.95), and an average of 1 request per day per player.",
                "Then we only need a > 1145.",
                "While this is a large number, it is small relative to the size of a large P2P network.",
                "Current systems all have a pool of users behaving like our altruists.",
                "This means that attempts to add a reputation system on top of an existing P2P system to influence users to cooperate will have no effect on rational users.",
                "To have a fair distribution of work, these systems must be fundamentally redesigned to eliminate the pool of altruistic users.",
                "In some sense, this is not a problem at all.",
                "In a system with altruists, the altruists are presumably happy, as are the standard agents, who get almost all their requests satisfied without having to do any work.",
                "Indeed, current P2P network work quite well in terms of distributing content to people.",
                "However, as we said in the introduction, there is some reason to believe these altruists may not be around forever.",
                "Thus, it is worth looking at what can be done to make these systems work in their absence.",
                "For the rest of this paper we assume that all agents are standard, and try to maximize expected utility.",
                "We are interested in equilibria based on a scrip system.",
                "Each time an agent has a request satisfied he must pay the person who satisfied it some amount.",
                "For now, we assume that the payment is fixed; for simplicity, we take the amount to be $1.",

                "We assume that M > 0 (otherwise no one will ever be able to get paid).",
                "In principle, agents are free to adopt a very wide variety of strategies.",
                "They can make decisions based on the names of other agents or use a strategy that is heavily history dependant, and mix these strategies freely.",
                "To aid our analysis, we would like to be able to restrict our attention to a simpler class of strategies.",
                "The class of strategies we are interested in is easy to motivate.",
                "The intuitive reason for wanting to earn money is to cater for the possibility that an agent will run out before he has a chance to earn more.",
                "On the other hand, a rational agent with plenty of mone would not want to work, because by the time he has managed to spend all his money, the util will have less value than the present cost of working.",

                "Note that the loan mechanism doesnt need to be built into the system; the agents can simply use a fake transaction to transfer the money.",
                "These appear to be the main avenues for collusive attacks, but we are still exploring this issue. 7.",
                "CONCLUSION We have given a formal analysis of a scrip system and have shown that the existence of a Nash equilibrium where all agents use a threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we can compute efficiency of equilibrium strategy and optimize the price (or money supply) to maximize efficiency.",
                "Thus, our analysis provides a formal mechanisms for solving some important problems in implementing scrip systems.",
                "It tells us that with a fixed population of rational users, such systems are very unlikely to become unstable.",
                "Thus if this stability is common belief among the agents we would not expect inflation, bubbles, or crashes because of agent speculation.",
                "However, we cannot rule out the possibility that that agents may have other beliefs that will cause them to speculate.",
                "Our analysis also tells us how to scale the system to handle an influx of new users without introducing these problems: scale the money supply to keep the average amount of money constant (or equivalently adjust prices to achieve the same goal).",
                "There are a number of theoretical issues that are still open, including a characterization of the multiplicity of equilibria - are there usually 2?",
                "In addition, we expect that one should be able to compute analytic estimates for the best response function and optimal pricing which would allow us to understand the relationship between pricing and various parameters in the model. 147 It would also be of great interest to extend our analysis to handle more realistic settings.",
                "We mention a few possible extensions here: • We have assumed that the world is homogeneous in a number of ways, including request frequency, utility, and ability to satisfy requests.",
                "It would be interesting to examine how relaxing any of these assumptions would alter our results. • We have assumed that there is no cost to an agent to be a member of the system.",
                "Suppose instead that we imposed a small cost simply for being present in the system to reflect the costs of routing messages and overlay maintainance.",
                "This modification could have a significant impact on sybil attacks. • We have described a scrip system that works when there are no altruists and have shown that no system can work once there there are sufficiently many altruists.",
                "What happens between these extremes? • One type of irrational behavior encountered with scrip systems is hoarding.",
                "There are some similarities between hoarding and altruistic behavior.",
                "While an altruist provide service for everyone, a hoarder will volunteer for all jobs (in order to get more money) and rarely request service (so as not to spend money).",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our system is robust against hoarders.",
                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",
                "It would be interesting to investigate the effect of such communities on the equilibrium of our system.",
                "There are also a number of implementation issues that would have to be resolved in a real system.",
                "For example, we need to worry about the possibility of agents counterfeiting money or lying about whether service was actually provided.",
                "Karma [26] provdes techniques for dealing with both of these issues and a number of others, but some of Karmas implementation decisions point to problems for our model.",
                "For example, it is prohibitively expensive to ensure that bank account balances can never go negative, a fact that our model does not capture.",
                "Another example is that Karma has nodes serve as bookkeepers for other nodes account balances.",
                "Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked.",

                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",

                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",
                "Some universities have started charging students for excessive bandwidth usage; others revoke network access for it [5].",
                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",

                "INTRODUCTION A common feature of many online distributed systems is that individuals provide services for each other.",
                "Peer-topeer (P2P) networks (such as Kazaa [25] or BitTorrent [3]) have proved popular as mechanisms for file sharing, and applications such as distributed computation and file storage are on the horizon; systems such as Seti@home [24] provide computational assistance; systems such as Slashdot [21] provide content, evaluations, and advice forums in which people answer each others questions.",
                "Having individuals provide each other with service typically increases the social welfare: the individual utilizing the resources of the system derives a greater benefit from it than the cost to the individual providing it.",
                "However, the cost of providing service can still be nontrivial.",
                "For example, users of Kazaa and BitTorrent may be charged for bandwidth usage; in addition, in some filesharing systems, there is the possibility of being sued, which can be viewed as part of the cost.",

                "This is not merely a theoretical problem; studies of the Gnutella [22] network have shown that almost 70 percent of users share no files and nearly 50 percent of responses are from the top 1 percent of sharing hosts [1].",
                "Having relatively few users provide most of the service creates a point of centralization; the disappearance of a small percentage of users can greatly impair the functionality of the system.",
                "Moreover, current trends seem to be leading to the elimination of the altruistic users on which these systems rely.",
                "These heavy users are some of the most expensive customers ISPs have.",
                "Thus, as the amount of traffic has grown, ISPs have begun to seek ways to reduce this traffic.",

                "A number of companies have also formed whose service is to detect excessive bandwidth usage [19].",
                "These trends make developing a system that encourages a more equal distribution of the work critical for the continued viability of P2P networks and other distributed online systems.",
                "A significant amount of research has gone into designing reputation systems to give preferential treatment to users who are sharing files.",
                "Some of the P2P networks currently in use have implemented versions of these techniques.",
                "However, these approaches tend to fall into one of two categories: either they are barter-like or reputational.",
                "By barter-like, we mean that each agent bases its decisions only on information it has derived from its own interactions.",
                "Perhaps the best-known example of a barter-like system is BitTorrent, where clients downloading a file try to find other clients with parts they are missing so that they can trade, thus creating a roughly equal amount of work.",
                "Since the barter is restricted to users currently interested in a single file, this works well for popular files, but tends to have problems maintaining availability of less popular ones.",
                "An example of a barter-like system built on top of a more traditional file-sharing system is the credit system used by eMule 140 [8].",
                "Each user tracks his history of interactions with other users and gives priority to those he has downloaded from in the past.",
                "However, in a large system, the probability that a pair of randomly-chosen users will have interacted before is quite small, so this interaction history will not be terribly helpful.",
                "Anagnostakis and Greenwald [2] present a more sophisticated version of this approach, but it still seems to suffer from similar problems.",
                "A number of attempts have been made at providing general reputation systems (e.g. [12, 13, 17, 27]).",
                "The basic idea is to aggregate each users experience into a global number for each individual that intuitively represents the systems view of that individuals reputation.",
                "However, these attempts tend to suffer from practical problems because they implicitly view users as either good or bad, assume that the good users will act according to the specified protocol, and that there are relatively few bad users.",
                "Unfortunately, if there are easy ways to game the system, once this information becomes widely available, rational users are likely to make use of it.",
                "We cannot count on only a few users being bad (in the sense of not following the prescribed protocol).",
                "For example, Kazaa uses a measure of the ratio of the number of uploads to the number of downloads to identify good and bad users.",
                "However, to avoid penalizing new users, they gave new users an average rating.",
                "Users discovered that they could use this relatively good rating to free ride for a while and, once it started to get bad, they could delete their stored information and effectively come back as a new user, thus circumventing the system (see [2] for a discussion and [11] for a formal analysis of this whitewashing).",
                "Thus Kazaas reputation system is ineffective.",
                "This is a simple case of a more general vulnerability of such systems to sybil attacks [6], where a single user maintains multiple identities and uses them in a coordinated fashion to get better service than he otherwise would.",
                "Recent work has shown that most common reputation systems are vulnerable (in the worst case)to such attacks [4]; however, the degree of this vulnerability is still unclear.",
                "The analyses of the practical vulnerabilities and the existence of such systems that are immune to such attacks remains an area of active research (e.g., [4, 28, 14]).",
                "Simple economic systems based on a scrip or money seem to avoid many of these problems, are easy to implement and are quite popular (see, e.g., [13, 15, 26]).",
                "However, they have a different set of problems.",
                "Perhaps the most common involve determining the amount of money in the system.",
                "Roughly speaking, if there is too little money in the system relative to the number of agents, then relatively few users can afford to make request.",
                "On the other hand, if there is too much money, then users will not feel the need to respond to a request; they have enough money already.",
                "A related problem involves handling newcomers.",
                "If newcomers are each given a positive amount of money, then the system is open to sybil attacks.",
                "Perhaps not surprisingly, scrip systems end up having to deal with standard economic woes such as inflation, bubbles, and crashes [26].",
                "In this paper, we provide a formal model in which to analyze scrip systems.",
                "We describe a simple scrip system and show that, under reasonable assumptions, for each fixed amount of money there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium involving threshold strategies, where an agent accepts a request if he has less than $k for some threshold k.1 An interesting aspect of our analysis is that, in equilibrium, the distribution of users with each amount of money is the distribution that maximizes entropy (subject to the money supply constraint).",
                "This allows us to compute the money supply that maximizes efficiency (social welfare), given the number of agents.",
                "It also leads to a solution for the problem of dealing with newcomers: we simply assume that new users come in with no money, and adjust the price of service (which is equivalent to adjusting the money supply) to maintain the ratio that maximizes efficiency.",
                "While assuming that new users come in with no money will not work in all settings, we believe the approach will be widely applicable.",
                "In systems where the goal is to do work, new users can acquire money by performing work.",
                "It should also work in Kazaalike system where a user can come in with some resources (e.g., a private collection of MP3s).",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present our formal model and observe that it can be used to understand the effect of altruists.",
                "In Section 3, we examine what happens in the game under nonstrategic play, if all agents use the same threshold strategy.",
                "We show that, in this case, the system quickly converges to a situation where the distribution of money is characterized by maximum entropy.",
                "Using this analysis, we show in Section 4 that, under minimal assumptions, there is a nontrivial Nash equilibrium in the game where all agents use some threshold strategy.",
                "Moreover, we show in Section 5 that the analysis leads to an understanding of how to choose the amount of money in the system (or, equivalently, the cost to fulfill a request) so as to maximize efficiency, and also shows how to handle new users.",
                "In Section 6, we discuss the extent to which our approach can handle sybils and collusion.",
                "We conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "THE MODEL To begin, we formalize providing service in a P2P network as a non-cooperative game.",
                "Unlike much of the modeling in this area, our model will model the asymmetric interactions in a file sharing system in which the matching of players (those requesting a file with those who have that particular file) is a key part of the system.",
                "This is in contrast with much previous work which uses random matching in a prisoners dilemma.",
                "Such models were studied in the economics literature [18, 7] and first applied to online reputations in [11]; an application to P2P is found in [9].",
                "This random-matching model fails to capture some salient aspects of a number of important settings.",
                "When a request is made, there are typically many people in the network who can potentially satisfy it (especially in a large P2P network), but not all can.",
                "For example, some people may not have the time or resources to satisfy the request.",
                "The randommatching process ignores the fact that some people may not be able to satisfy the request.",
                "Presumably, if the person matched with the requester could not satisfy the match, he would have to defect.",
                "Moreover, it does not capture the fact that the decision as to whether to volunteer to satisfy the request should be made before the matching process, not after.",
                "That is, the matching process does not capture 1 Although we refer to our unit of scrip as the dollar, these are not real dollars nor do we view them as convertible to dollars. 141 the fact that if someone is unwilling to satisfy the request, there will doubtless be others who can satisfy it.",
                "Finally, the actions and payoffs in the prisoners dilemma game do not obviously correspond to actual choices that can be made.",
                "For example, it is not clear what defection on the part of the requester means.",
                "In our model we try to deal with all these issues.",
                "Suppose that there are n agents.",
                "At each round, an agent is picked uniformly at random to make a request.",
                "Each other agent is able to satisfy this request with probability β > 0 at all times, independent of previous behavior.",
                "The term β is intended to capture the probability that an agent is busy, or does not have the resources to fulfill the request.",
                "Assuming that β is time-independent does not capture the intution that being an unable to fulfill a request at time t may well be correlated with being unable to fulfill it at time t+1.",
                "We believe that, in large systems, we should be able to drop the independence assumption, but we leave this for future work.",
                "In any case, those agents that are able to satisfy the request must choose whether or not to volunteer to satisfy it.",
                "If at least one agent volunteers, the requester gets a benefit of 1 util (the job is done) and one of volunteers is chosen at random to fulfill the request.",
                "The agent that fulfills the request pays a cost of α < 1.",
                "As is standard in the literature, we assume that agents discount future payoffs by a factor of δ per time unit.",
                "This captures the intuition that a util now is worth more than a util tomorrow, and allows us to compute the total utility derived by an agent in an infinite game.",
                "Lastly, we assume that with more players requests come more often.",
                "Thus we assume that the time between rounds is 1/n.",
                "This captures the fact that the systems we want to model are really processing many requests in parallel, so we would expect the number of concurrent requests to be proportional to the number of users.2 Let G(n, δ, α, β) denote this game with n agents, a discount factor of δ, a cost to satisfy requests of α, and a probability of being able to satisfy requests of β.",
                "When the latter two parameters are not relevant, we sometimes write G(n, δ).",
                "We use the following notation throughout the paper: • pt denotes the agent chosen in round t. • Bt i ∈ {0, 1} denotes whether agent i can satisfy the request in round t. Bt i = 1 with probability β > 0 and Bt i is independent of Bt i for all t = t. • V t i ∈ {0, 1} denotes agent is decision about whether to volunteer in round t; 1 indicates volunteering.",

                "Clearly with too many hoarders, there may not be enough money remaining among the non-hoarders to guarantee that, typically, a non-hoarder would have enough money to satisfy a request. • Finally, in P2P filesharing systems, there are overlapping communities of various sizes that are significantly more likely to be able to satisfy each others requests.",

                "Like maintaining a presence in the network, this imposes a cost on the node, but unlike that, responsibility it can be easily shirked.",
