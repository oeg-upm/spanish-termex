Our bidding agent is able to build probabilistic models of both the behaviour of users who view the adverts, and the auctions that it participates within. It then uses these models to maximise the exposure that its adverts receive. We evaluate the effectiveness of this bidding agent through simulation against a range of alternative selection mechanisms including a simple bidding strategy, random allocation, and a centralised optimal allocation with perfect foresight. Our bidding agent significantly outperforms both the simple bidding strategy and the random allocation, and in a mixed population of agents it is able to expose its adverts to 25% more users than the simple bidding strategy. Moreover, its performance is within 7.5% of that of the centralised optimal allocation despite the highly uncertain environment in which it must operate.

INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby. Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9]. Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed. These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7]. As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11]. However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously. By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8]. Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display. Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert. This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction. The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user. In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach. In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user. This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency). In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible. In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events). The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period). Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle. In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget. Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1. We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations. We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2. Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid. The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3. We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it. We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4. Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space. Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents. In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2. RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1]. These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com). Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited. Gerding et al. present a simulated system (CASy) whereby a Vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2]. The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays. Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences. However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences. By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7]. User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment. When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown. Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles. Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information. Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3. THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment. To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1. Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2. Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3. The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4. Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system. To date, a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has been demonstrated [8]. This system uses a 23 inch flat-screen display deployed within an office environment to advertise events and news items. Rather than requiring the deployment of specialised hardware, such as active badges (see [11] for details), BluScreen detects the presence of users in the vicinity of each display through the Bluetooth-enabled devices that they carry with them everyday1 . 1 Devices must be in discovery mode to detectable. 264 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Device Type Unique Samples Devices Occasional < 10 135 Frequent 10 − 1000 70 Persistent > 1000 6 Table 1: Number of Bluetooth devices observed at different frequencies over a six month sample period. This approach is attractive since the Bluetooth wireless protocol is characterised by its relative maturity, market penetration, and emphasis on short-range communication. Table 1 summarises the number of devices detected by this prototype installation over a six month period. Of the 212 Bluetooth devices detected, approximately 70 were detected regularly, showing that Bluetooth is a suitable proxy for detecting individuals in front of the screen. In order to achieve a scalable and extendable solution a multiagent systems design philosophy is adopted whereby a number of different agents types interact (see figure 2). The interactions of these agents are implemented through a web services protocol2 , and they constitute a decentralised marketplace that allocates advertising space in an efficient and timely manner. In more detail, the responsibilities of each agent types are: Bluetooth Device Detection Agent: This agent monitors the environment in the vicinity of a BluScreen display and determines the number and identity of any Bluetooth devices that are close by. It keeps historical records of the arrival and departure of Bluetooth devices, and makes this information available to advertising agents as requested. Marketplace Agent: This agent facilitates the sale of advertising space to the advertising agents. A single marketplace agent represents each BluScreen display, and access to this screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles of fixed duration. Before the start of each advertising cycle, the marketplace agent holds a sealed-bid auction (see section 4 for more details). The winner of this auction is allocated access to the display during the next cycle. Advertising Agent: This agent represents a single advert and is responsible for submitting bids to the marketplace agent in order that it may be allocated advertising cycles, and thus, display its advert to users. It interacts with the device detection agent in order to collect information regarding the number and identity of users who are currently in front of the display. On the basis of this information, its past experiences, and its bidding strategy, it calculates the value of the bid that it should submit to the marketplace agent. Thus, having described the prototype BluScreen system, we next go on to describe the details of the auction mechanism that we consider in this work, and then the advanced bidding agent that operates bids within this auction. 4. THE AUCTION MECHANISM As described above, BluScreen is designed to efficiency allocate advertising cycles in a distributed and timely manner. Thus, oneshot sealed bid auctions are used for the market mechanism of the marketplace agent. In previous work, each advertising agent was assumed to have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user. Under this assumption, a secondprice sealed-bid auction was shown to be effective, since advertis2 This is implemented on a distributed Mac OS X based system using the Bonjour networking protocol for service discovery.

However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user. This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible. In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction. Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results. Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 . We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle. The marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each advertising agent. At the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not announced to all observers). In the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed. Having described the market mechanism that the marketplace agent implements, we now go on to describe and evaluate an advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents to adopt. 5. ADVANCED BIDDING STRATEGY As described above, we consider the case that the advertising agents do not have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing the advert to a single user. Rather, they have a constrained budget, B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to display their advert. Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the exposure of their advert. In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events. It will be uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 3 This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 265 is known, some may leave before the advert commences, and others may arrive. Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents. Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert. In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction. The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget. Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle. However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed). Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users. Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd. This represents a simple model that is commonly applied within queuing theory5 [5], yet is one that we believe well describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in communal areas where people meet and congregate. Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd. In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n! In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes. Our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users. 0 t t + tc τ (i) n users ? (iii) λatc users ? (ii) λat users ? Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc, commencing at time t in the future. In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates. Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period. Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 . Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3). This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc. Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt . Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present. In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt . Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present. Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle. Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid. This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic. Since our advertising agents are unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 6 Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire advertising cycle in order to be counted as present. 266 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded. Thus, we take a decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price of goods by observing transaction prices [4]. Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b). This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive. In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid. To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function. This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ. The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 . In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ. The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions. An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi. Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1. In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0. Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above. The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient. This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget. We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 . Thus, we can use the results of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agents period of 7 In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is no evidence of where the transition point between successful and unsuccessful bids is likely to occur. Thus, in this case, an additional pair with value {α min(b1 . . . bn), 0} is automatically created. Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be. We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest. In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first. If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle. Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility). By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future). Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero). Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability. Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.

Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next auction. Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for the remaining advertising cycles of the agents period of interest. 5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9 can not be performed analytically. Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation. However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1). Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2). To this end, figure 5 shows an example calculated using parameter values λa = 1/120, λd = 1/480 and tc = 120. In this case, we assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e. P(10) = 0.5). In addition, we assume that n = λa/λd = 4, and thus the initial number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect to find present at any time. The plot indicates that when the budget is small, then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values of b1. This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0). However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2). This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one. In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd). If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences). Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future). However, in both cases, a transition occurs whereby given sufficient budget it is preferable to allocate the budget evenly between both auctions9 . 9 In fact, one auction is still slightly preferred, but the difference in temp ← 1 rate ← 0.995 bold ← initial random allocation Uold ← Evaluate(bold ) WHILE temp > 0.0001 i, j ← random integer index within b t ← random real number between 0 and bi bnew ← bold bnew i ← bold i − t bnew j ← bold j + t Unew ← Evaluate(bnew ) IF rand < exp((Unew − Uold )/temp) THEN bold ← bnew Uold ← Unew ENDIF temp ← temp × rate ENDWHILE Figure 6: Stochastic optimisation algorithm to calculate the optimal sequence of bids in the general case of multiple auctions. 5.4.2 General Case In general, the behaviour seen in the previous example characterises the optimal bidding behaviour of the advertising agent. If there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in the maximum expected utility. However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction. The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors. If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive. Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert. Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive. Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids. However, the inverse problem (that of calculating the expected utility for any given sequence of bids) is easy. Thus, we can use a stochastic optimisation routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation problem. This algorithm starts by assuming some initial random allocation of bids (normalised such that the total of all the bids is equal to the budget B). It then makes small adjustments to this allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to another. If this transfer results in an increase in expected utility, then it is accepted. If it results in a decrease in expected utility, it might still be accepted, but with a probability that is determined by a temperature parameter. This temperature parameter is annealed such that the probability of accepting such transfers decreases over time. In figure 6 we present this algorithm in pseudo-code. 6. EVALUATION In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced bidding strategy developed within this paper we compare its performance to three alternative mechanisms. One of these mechanisms represents a simple alternative bidding strategy for the advertising agents, whilst the other two are centralised allocation mechanisms that represent expected utility between this and an even allocation is negliable. 268 The Sixth Intl.

Results are averaged over 50 simulation runs and error bars indicate the standard error in the mean. the upper and lower bounds to the overall performance of the system. In more detail, the four mechanisms that we compare are: Random Allocation: Rather than implementing the auction mechanism, the advertising cycle is randomly allocated to one of the advertising agents. Simple Bidding Strategy: We implement the full auction mechanism but with a population of advertising agents that employ a simple bidding strategy. These advertising agents do not attempt to model the users or the auction environment in which they bid, but rather, they simply evenly allocate their remaining budget over the remaining advertising cycles. Advanced Bidding Strategy: We implement the full auction mechanism with a population of advertising agents using the probabilistic models and the bidding strategy described here. Optimal Allocation: Rather than implementing the auction mechanism, the advertising cycle is allocated to the advertising agent that will derive the maximum utility from it, given perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrive and depart in all future advertising cycles. Using these four alternative allocation mechanisms, we ran repeated simulations of two hours of operation of the entire BluScreen environment for a default set of parameters whereby the arrival and departure rate of the users are given by λa = 1/120s and λd = 1/480s, and the length of an advertising cycle is 120s. Each advertising agent is assigned an advert with a period of interest drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 8 advertising cycles, and these agents are initially allocated a budget equal to 10 times their period of interest. For each simulation run, we measure the mean normalised exposure of each advert. That is, the fraction of users who were detected by the BluScreen display during the period of interest of the advertising agent who were actually exposed to the agents advert. Thus a mean normalised exposure of 1 indicates that the agent managed to expose its advert to all of the users who were present during its period of interest (and a mean normalised exposure of 0 means that no users were exposed to the advert). Figure 7 shows the results of this experiments. We first observe the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases, and thus the competition between them increases, then the mean normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases. We then observe that in all cases, there is no statistically significant improvement in using the simple bidding strategy compared to random allocation (p > 0.25 in Students t-test). Since this simple bidding strategy does not take account of the number of users present, and in general, simply increases its bid price in each auction until it does in fact win one, this is not unexpected. However, in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and its performance is within 7.5% of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles. In addition, we present results of experiments performed over a range of parameter values, and also with a mixed population of advertising agents using both the advanced and simple bidding strategies. This is an important scenario since advertisers may wish to supply their own bidding agents, and thus, a homogeneous population is not guaranteed. In each case, keeping all other parameters fixed, we varied one parameter, and these results are shown in figure 8. In general, we see the similar trends as before. Increasing the departure rate causes an decrease in the mean normalised exposure since advertising agents have less opportunities to expose users to their adverts. Increasing the period of interest of each agent decreases the mean normalised exposure, since more advertising agents are now competing for the same users. Finally, increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain. However, in all cases, the advanced bidding strategy significantly outperforms the simple one (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test). On average, we observe that advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy. Finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in. Figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two bidding strategies. In each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by advertising agents within the BluScreen advertising system. This bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict the arrival and departure of users, and also to model their success within a first-price sealed bid auction by observing both the bids that they themselves submitted and the winning bid.

We presented an algorithm based upon simulated annealing to solve for the optimal bidding strategy, and in simulation, this bidding strategy was shown to significantly outperform a simple bidding strategy that had none of these features. Its performance closely approached that of a central optimal allocation, with perfect knowledge of the arrival and departure of users, despite the uncertain environment in which the strategy must operate. Our future work in this area consists of extending this bidding strategy to richer environments where there are multiple interrelated display screens, where maintaining profiles of users allows a richer matching of user to advert, and where alternative auction mechanisms are applied (we a particularly interesting in introducing a pay per user auction setting similar to the pay per click auctions employed by internet search websites). This work will continue to be done in conjunction with the deployment of more BluScreen prototypes in order to gain further real world experience. 8.

Jennings1 1 Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Reino Unido. {ACR, TRP, NRJ}@ecs.soton.ac.uk 2 Ashkelon College, Ashkelon, Israel.astrdod@ash-college.ac.il Resumen En este documento presentamos un agente de licitación avanzado que participa en subastas de ofertas selladas de primer precio para asignar espacio publicitario en Bluscreen, un sistema de publicidad público experimental que detecta a los usuarios a través de su Bluetooth habilitadodispositivos. Nuestro agente de licitación puede crear modelos probabilísticos tanto del comportamiento de los usuarios que ven los anuncios como las subastas en las que participa. Luego usa estos modelos para maximizar la exposición que reciben sus anuncios. Evaluamos la efectividad de este agente de licitación a través de la simulación contra una variedad de mecanismos de selección alternativos que incluye una estrategia de licitación simple, asignación aleatoria y una asignación óptima centralizada con una previsión perfecta. Nuestro agente de licitación supera significativamente la estrategia de licitación simple y la asignación aleatoria, y en una población mixta de agentes puede exponer sus anuncios a un 25% más de usuarios que la estrategia de licitación simple. Además, su rendimiento está dentro del 7.5% de la de la asignación óptima centralizada a pesar del entorno altamente incierto en el que debe operar.

Introducción Las exhibiciones electrónicas se utilizan cada vez más en entornos públicos, como aeropuertos, centros de la ciudad y tiendas minoristas, para anunciar productos comerciales o para entretener e informar a los transeúntes. Recientemente, los investigadores han comenzado a investigar cómo el contenido de tales pantallas puede variar dinámicamente con el tiempo para aumentar su variedad, relevancia y exposición [9]. La atención particular de la investigación se ha centrado en la necesidad de tener en cuenta la naturaleza dinámica de la audiencia de las pantallas, y con este fin, se han propuesto una serie de exhibiciones públicas interactivas. Estas pantallas generalmente han abordado las necesidades de un conjunto cerrado de usuarios conocidos con intereses y requisitos predefinidos, y han facilitado la comunicación con estos usuarios a través del uso activo de dispositivos portátiles como PDA o teléfonos [3, 7]. Como tal, estos sistemas asumen conocimiento previo sobre el público objetivo y requieren que un solo usuario tenga acceso exclusivo a la pantalla, o que los usuarios llevan dispositivos de seguimiento específicos para que se pueda identificar su presencia [6, 11]. Sin embargo, estos enfoques no funcionan en espacios públicos, donde no existe ningún conocimiento previo sobre los usuarios que pueden ver la pantalla, y donde tales pantallas deben reaccionar ante la presencia de varios usuarios simultáneamente. Por el contrario, Payne et al.Han desarrollado un sistema de visualización público inteligente, llamado Bluscreen, que detecta y rastrea a los usuarios a través de los dispositivos habilitados con Bluetooth que llevan consigo todos los días [8]. Dentro de este sistema, se utiliza un mecanismo de subasta de agente múltiple descentralizado para asignar eficientemente el tiempo de publicidad en cada pantalla pública. Cada anuncio está representado por un agente de publicidad individual que mantiene un historial de usuarios que ya han estado expuestos al anuncio. Este agente luego busca adquirir ciclos publicitarios (durante los cuales puede mostrar su anuncio en las pantallas públicas) enviando ofertas a un agente del mercado que implementa una subasta de ofertas selladas. El valor de estas ofertas se basa en el número de usuarios que actualmente están presentes frente a la pantalla, el historial de estos usuarios y una estimación derivada externamente del valor de exponer un anuncio a un usuario. En este artículo, presentamos un agente de licitación avanzado que extiende significativamente la sofisticación de este enfoque. En particular, consideramos el entorno más general en el que es imposible determinar una valoración a priori para exponer un anuncio a un usuario. Es probable que este sea el caso de las instalaciones de Bluscreen dentro de las organizaciones privadas donde los artículos que se anuncian son los próximos eventos o noticias de interés para los empleados y visitantes, y por lo tanto no tienen un valor monetario directo (de hecho, en este caso, es probable que las ofertas se realicen enalguna moneda virtual). Además, también es probable que sea el caso dentro de nuevas instalaciones comerciales donde la experiencia limitada del mercado hace que la estimación sea imposible de la valoración. En ambos casos, es más apropiado suponer que a los agentes publicitarios se les asignará un presupuesto publicitario total, y que tendrá un período de tiempo limitado para gastar este presupuesto (particularmente, así que donde los anuncios están para los próximos eventos). El agente de publicidad simplemente se encarga de usar este presupuesto con el máximo efecto (es decir, para lograr la máxima exposición publicitaria dentro de este período de tiempo). Ahora, para lograr este objetivo, el agente de publicidad debe ser capaz de modelar el comportamiento de los usuarios para predecir el número que estará presente en cualquier ciclo publicitario futuro. Además, también debe comprender el entorno de subasta en el que 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas que compite, para que pueda hacer el mejor uso de su presupuesto limitado. Por lo tanto, al desarrollar un agente de licitación avanzado que logre esto, avanzamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Permitimos que los agentes publicitarios modelen la llegada y la salida de los usuarios como procesos de Poisson independientes, y que hagan estimaciones de máxima probabilidad de las tasas de estos procesos en función de sus observaciones. Mostramos cómo estos agentes pueden calcular el número esperado de usuarios que estarán presentes durante cualquier ciclo publicitario futuro.2. Utilizando un enfoque teórico de decisión, permitimos a los agentes publicitarios modelar la probabilidad de ganar una subasta dada cuando se oferta una cantidad específica. La forma acumulativa de la distribución gamma se usa para representar esta probabilidad, y sus parámetros se ajustan utilizando observaciones tanto del precio de cierre de las subastas anteriores como de las ofertas que presenta el propio agente de publicidad.3. Mostramos que nuestra suposición explícita de que el agente de publicidad no obtiene ningún beneficio adicional al mostrar un anuncio a un solo usuario más de una vez, hace que la utilidad esperada de cada ciclo publicitario futuro dependa del resultado esperado de todas las subastas que lo precedan. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo de optimización estocástica basado en el recocido simulado que permite al agente de publicidad calcular la secuencia óptima de BID que maximiza su utilidad esperada.4. Finalmente, demostramos que esta estrategia de licitación avanzada supera una estrategia simple sin ninguna de estas características (dentro de una población heterogénea, los agentes publicitarios que usan la estrategia de licitación avanzada pueden exponer sus anuncios a un 25% más de usuarios que aquellos que usan la estrategia de licitación simple), y mostramos que funciona dentro del 7.5% de la de un optimizador centralizado con un conocimiento perfecto del número de usuarios que llegarán y partirán en todos los ciclos publicitarios futuros. El resto de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: la Sección 2 discute el trabajo relacionado donde los agentes y los mercados basados en la subasta se utilizan para asignar el espacio publicitario. La Sección 3 describe el sistema prototipo de pantalla azul que motiva su trabajo. En la Sección 4 presentamos una descripción detallada del mecanismo de asignación de subastas, y en la Sección 5 describimos nuestra estrategia de licitación avanzada para los agentes publicitarios. En la Sección 6 presentamos una validación empírica de nuestro enfoque, y finalmente concluimos en la Sección 7. 2. Trabajo relacionado El atractivo comercial de la publicidad dirigida se ha demostrado ampliamente en Internet, donde los sistemas de recomendación y los anuncios de pancartas contextuales son la norma [1]. Estos sistemas generalmente seleccionan contenido basado en el conocimiento previo del individuo que ve el material, y dichos sistemas funcionan bien en dispositivos personales donde las preferencias e intereses de los propietarios pueden reunirse y almacenarse en caché localmente, o dentro de entornos interactivos que utilizan alguna forma de credencial para identificar la identificación de las credenciales para identificar lasUsuario (por ejemplo, sitios de comercio electrónico como Amazon.com). Los intentos de aplicar estos enfoques dentro del mundo real han sido mucho más limitados. Gerding et al.Presente un sistema simulado (CASY) mediante el cual se utiliza un mecanismo de subasta de Vickrey para vender espacio publicitario dentro de un centro comercial electrónico modelado [2]. La subasta se utiliza para clasificar un conjunto de posibles anuncios proporcionados por diferentes puntos de venta, y los anuncios de clasificación superior se seleccionan para su presentación en pantallas públicas. Se proporciona comentarios a través de la información de ventas posterior, lo que permite que el modelo construya un perfil de las preferencias de los usuarios. Sin embargo, a diferencia de Bluscreen Figura 1: un prototipo Bluscreen desplegado.Sistema que consideramos aquí, no es adecuado para la publicidad a muchas personas simultáneamente, ya que requiere una interacción explícita con un solo usuario para adquirir las preferencias de los usuarios. Por el contrario, McCarthy et al.han presentado una implementación prototipo de un sistema (Groupcast) que intenta responder a un grupo de individuos asumiendo perfiles a priori de varios miembros de la audiencia [7]. La identificación del usuario se basa en insignias infrarrojas y sensores integrados dentro de un entorno de oficina. Cuando varios usuarios pasan por la pantalla, un sistema centralizado compara los perfiles de los usuarios para identificar áreas comunes de interés, y se muestra el contenido que coincide con este interés común. Por lo tanto, aunque es un sistema simulado que permite a los anunciantes competir por la atención del usuario único, Groupcast es un sistema prototipo que detecta la presencia de grupos de usuarios y selecciona contenido para que coincida con sus perfiles. A pesar de sus similitudes, ninguno de los sistemas aborda la configuración que nos interesa aquí: cómo asignar espacio publicitario entre anunciantes competidores que enfrentan una audiencia de múltiples personas sobre las cuales no hay información de perfil a priori. Por lo tanto, en la siguiente sección describimos el sistema prototipo Bluscreen que motiva nuestro trabajo.3. El prototipo Bluscreen Bluscreen se basa en la noción de un marco publicitario escalable y extensible por el cual los anuncios se pueden mostrar eficientemente a la mayor cantidad de usuarios relevantes como sea posible, dentro de un entorno pobre en el conocimiento. Para lograr estos objetivos, se han identificado varios requisitos: 1. Los anuncios deben presentarse a una audiencia lo más diversa posible, al tiempo que minimiza la cantidad de veces que el anuncio se presenta a cualquier usuario único.2. Los usuarios deben ser identificados por dispositivos ubicuos y de consumo existentes, de modo que las implementaciones futuras dentro de los ámbitos públicos no requiera la absorción de hardware nuevo.3. El número de pantallas debe ser escalable, de modo que los anuncios aparecen en diferentes pantallas en diferentes momentos.4. El conocimiento sobre el comportamiento observado y la composición de la audiencia deben ser explotados para facilitar la inferencia de los intereses de los usuarios que el sistema puede explotar. Hasta la fecha, se ha demostrado un prototipo de sistemas que aborda los dos primeros objetivos [8]. Este sistema utiliza una pantalla de pantalla plana de 23 pulgadas desplegada dentro de un entorno de oficina para anunciar eventos y noticias. En lugar de requerir el despliegue de hardware especializado, como las insignias activas (ver [11] para más detalles), Bluscreen detecta la presencia de usuarios en las proximidades de cada pantalla a través de los dispositivos habilitados para Bluetooth que llevan consigo todos los días1.1 Los dispositivos deben estar en modo de descubrimiento para detectable.264 El sexto intl.

Este enfoque es atractivo ya que el protocolo inalámbrico Bluetooth se caracteriza por su madurez relativa, penetración del mercado y énfasis en la comunicación de corto alcance. La Tabla 1 resume el número de dispositivos detectados por esta instalación del prototipo durante un período de seis meses. De los 212 dispositivos Bluetooth detectados, aproximadamente 70 se detectaron regularmente, lo que demuestra que Bluetooth es un proxy adecuado para detectar individuos frente a la pantalla. Para lograr una solución escalable y extensible, se adopta una filosofía de diseño de sistemas multiagente por el cual interactúan varios tipos de agentes diferentes (ver Figura 2). Las interacciones de estos agentes se implementan a través de un protocolo de servicios web2, y constituyen un mercado descentralizado que asigna espacio publicitario de manera eficiente y oportuna. Con más detalle, las responsabilidades de cada agente son: Agente de detección de dispositivos Bluetooth: este agente monitorea el entorno en la vecindad de una pantalla Bluscreen y determina el número y la identidad de cualquier dispositivo Bluetooth que esté cerca. Mantiene registros históricos de la llegada y salida de dispositivos Bluetooth, y pone esta información a disposición de los agentes publicitarios según lo solicitado. Agente del mercado: este agente facilita la venta de espacio publicitario a los agentes publicitarios. Un solo agente de mercado representa cada pantalla Bluscreen, y el acceso a esta pantalla se divide en ciclos de publicidad discretos de duración fija. Antes del inicio de cada ciclo publicitario, el agente del mercado posee una subasta de oferta sellada (consulte la Sección 4 para obtener más detalles). El ganador de esta subasta se asigna acceso a la pantalla durante el siguiente ciclo. Agente de publicidad: este agente representa un único anuncio y es responsable de enviar ofertas al agente del mercado para que se les asigne ciclos publicitarios y, por lo tanto, mostrar su anuncio a los usuarios. Interactúa con el agente de detección de dispositivos para recopilar información sobre el número y la identidad de los usuarios que actualmente están frente a la pantalla. Sobre la base de esta información, sus experiencias pasadas y su estrategia de licitación, calcula el valor de la oferta que debe presentar al agente del mercado. Por lo tanto, habiendo descrito el sistema prototipo Bluscreen, luego describimos los detalles del mecanismo de subasta que consideramos en este trabajo, y luego el agente de licitación avanzada que opera ofertas dentro de esta subasta.4. El mecanismo de subasta como se describió anteriormente, Bluscreen está diseñado para asignar ciclos publicitarios de manera distribuida y oportuna. Por lo tanto, las subastas de ofertas selladas de OneShot se utilizan para el mecanismo de mercado del agente del mercado. En trabajos anteriores, se suponía que cada agente de publicidad tenía una estimación derivada externamente del valor de exponer un anuncio a un usuario. Bajo esta suposición, se demostró que una subasta de la tarde sellada de segundo precio es efectiva, ya que AdvertIs2 esto se implementa en un sistema distribuido con sede en Mac OS X utilizando el protocolo de red de Bonjour para el descubrimiento de servicios.

Sin embargo, como se describió anteriormente, en este documento consideramos el entorno más general en el que es imposible determinar una valoración a priori para exponer un anuncio a un solo usuario. Esto puede deberse a que la instalación de Bluscreen se encuentra dentro de una organización privada donde lo que se anuncia (por ejemplo, noticias o eventos próximos) no tiene valor monetario, o puede ser una nueva instalación comercial donde la experiencia limitada del mercado hace que la estimación de una valoración tan imposible. En ausencia de tal valoración, las atractivas propiedades económicas de la subasta de segundo precio no se pueden lograr en la práctica y, por lo tanto, en nuestro trabajo no hay necesidad de limitar nuestra atención a la subasta de segundo precio. De hecho, dado que estas subastas son realmente extremadamente raras en los entornos del mundo real [10], en este trabajo consideramos la subasta de primer precio más adoptada, ya que esto aumenta la aplicabilidad de nuestros resultados. Por lo tanto, con más detalle, consideramos una instancia de una instalación Bluscreen con una sola pantalla que es administrada por un solo agente de mercado3. Consideramos que el acceso a la pantalla de visualización se divide en ciclos de publicidad discretos, cada uno de TC de longitud y una subasta de oferta sellada de primer precio se mantiene inmediatamente antes del inicio de cada ciclo publicitario. El agente del mercado anuncia el inicio y la fecha límite de la subasta, y recolecta ofertas selladas de cada agente de publicidad. En el momento de cierre de la subasta, el agente del mercado anuncia a todos los participantes y observadores el monto de la oferta ganadora, y le informa al agente publicitario ganador de que tuvo éxito (la identidad del agente de publicidad ganador no se anuncia a todos los observadores). En el caso de que no se realicen ofertas dentro de ninguna subasta, se muestra un anuncio predeterminado. Habiendo descrito el mecanismo de mercado que implementa el agente del mercado, ahora describimos y evaluamos una estrategia de licitación avanzada para que los agentes publicitarios adopten.5. Estrategia de licitación avanzada Como se describió anteriormente, consideramos el caso de que los agentes de publicidad no tienen una estimación derivada externamente del valor de exponer el anuncio a un solo usuario. Más bien, tienen un presupuesto limitado, B y un período de interés limitado durante el cual desean mostrar su anuncio. Su objetivo es encontrar la cantidad apropiada para ofertar dentro de cada subasta en este período, para maximizar la exposición de su anuncio. Al intentar lograr este objetivo, el agente de publicidad se enfrenta a un alto nivel de incertidumbre sobre eventos futuros. No estará seguro de la cantidad de usuarios que estarán presentes durante cualquier ciclo publicitario, ya que incluso si el número de usuarios actualmente presenta esta suposición de tener una sola instancia bluscreen para simplificar nuestra tarea de validar la exactitud y la eficiencia delMecanismo y estrategia propuestos, y generalizar estos resultados al caso de múltiples pantallas es el objetivo de nuestro trabajo futuro. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 265 es conocido, algunos pueden irse antes de que comience el anuncio, y otros pueden llegar. Además, la cantidad que se debe ofertar para garantizar que se gane una subasta es incierta ya que depende del número y el comportamiento de los agentes publicitarios competitivos. Por lo tanto, permitimos que el agente utilice sus observaciones de la llegada y la salida de los usuarios para construir un modelo probabilístico, basado en procesos de Poisson independientes, que describen el número de usuarios que probablemente estén expuestos a cualquier anuncio. Además, permitimos al agente observar el resultado de las subastas previas del ciclo publicitario y utilizar las observaciones del precio de cierre, y el éxito o otro de las ofertas que presentó, para construir un modelo probabilístico de la oferta requerida para ganarla subasta. Luego, el agente usa estos dos modelos para calcular su utilidad esperada en cada ciclo publicitario y, a su vez, determinar la secuencia óptima de BID que maximiza esta utilidad dado su presupuesto restringido. Habiendo calculado esta secuencia de ofertas, la primera oferta en la secuencia en realidad se usa en la subasta para el próximo ciclo publicitario. Sin embargo, al cierre de este ciclo, el proceso se repite con una nueva secuencia óptima de ofertas que se calculan para tener en cuenta lo que realmente sucedió en la subasta anterior (es decir, si la oferta fue exitosa o no, y cuántos usuarios llegarono partió). Por lo tanto, en las siguientes tres subsecciones describimos estos dos modelos probabilísticos y su aplicación dentro de la estrategia de licitación del agente de publicidad.5.1 Predecir el número de usuarios para predecir el número de usuarios que estarán presentes en cualquier ciclo publicitario futuro, es necesario proponer un modelo probabilístico para el comportamiento de los usuarios. Por lo tanto, nuestra estrategia de licitación avanzada supone que su llegada y salidas están determinadas por dos procesos de Poisson independientes4 con tasa de llegada, λA y tasa de salida, λd. Esto representa un modelo simple que se aplica comúnmente dentro de la teoría de colas 5 [5], pero creemos que describe bien el caso donde las pantallas Bluscreen se colocan en áreas comunales donde las personas se reúnen y se congregan. Dado el historial de los llegadas de los usuarios y las salidas obtenidas del agente de detección de dispositivos, el agente de publicidad realiza una estimación de máxima probabilidad de los valores de λA y λd. Con más detalle, si el agente de publicidad ha observado a N usuarios que llegan dentro de un período de tiempo t, entonces la estimación de máxima probabilidad para la tasa de llegada λA simplemente es dada simplemente por: λa = n t (1) también, si un agente observa n usuarios con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno con cada uno conUna duración de la estadía de T1, T2 ,..., TN períodos de tiempo, entonces la estimación de máxima verosimilitud para la tasa de salida λd dada por: 1 λd = 1 n n i = 1 ti (2) 4 Dada una distribución de Poisson con el parámetro de tasa λ, el número de eventos, dentro de un intervalode tiempo t viene dado por: p (n) = e - λt (λt) n n! Además, la probabilidad de tener que esperar un período de tiempo, t, antes de que el próximo evento se determine por: p (t) = λeλt 5 nota, sin embargo, que en la teoría de colas es típicamente la tasa de llegada y los tiempos de servicio de los clientes que sonmodelado como procesos de Poisson. Nuestros usuarios no están modelados como una cola ya que la duración de su estadía es independiente de la de los otros usuarios.0 t t + tc τ (i) n usuarios?(iii) Usuarios de λATC?(ii) Usuarios de λat? Figura 3: Ejemplo que muestra cómo predecir el número de usuarios que ven un anuncio que se muestra en un ciclo publicitario de longitud TC, comenzando en el tiempo T en el futuro. En entornos donde estas tasas están sujetas a cambios, el agente puede usar una ventana de tiempo limitada sobre la cual se utilizan las observaciones para estimar estas tasas. Alternativamente, en situaciones en las que es probable que ocurran cambios cíclicos en estas tasas (es decir, cambiando las tasas de llegada y salida en diferentes momentos del día, como se puede ver en áreas donde los viajeros pasan), el agente puede estimar valores separados durante cada hora de larga duraciónperíodo. Habiendo estimado la tasa de llegada y salida de los usuarios, y conociendo el número de usuarios que están presentes en el momento actual, el agente publicitario puede predecir el número de usuarios que probablemente estén presentes en cualquier ciclo de publicidad futuro6. Por lo tanto, consideramos el problema de predecir este número para un ciclo publicitario de duración TC que comienza en un tiempo t en el futuro, dado que los usuarios están actualmente presentes (ver Figura 3). Este número estará compuesto por tres factores: (i) la fracción de los n usuarios que inicialmente están presentes que no se van en el intervalo, 0 ≤ τ <t, antes de que comience el ciclo publicitario, (ii) usuarios que realmente llegan aEl intervalo, 0 ≤ τ <t, y todavía están presentes cuando el ciclo publicitario realmente comienza, y finalmente, (iii) usuarios que llegan durante el curso del ciclo publicitario, t ≤ τ <t + tc. Ahora, considerando el caso (i) arriba, la probabilidad de que uno de los n usuarios aún esté presente cuando se inicia el ciclo publicitario viene dada por ∞ t λde - λdτ dτ = e - λdt. Por lo tanto, esperamos que esté presente NE - λDT de estos usuarios. En el caso (ii), esperamos que lleguen los nuevos usuarios antes de que comience el ciclo publicitario, y la probabilidad de que alguno de estos aún esté allí cuando realmente lo haga por 1 t t 0 e - λd (t - τ) dτ= 1 λdt 1 - e - λdt. Por lo tanto, esperamos que esté presente λA λd 1 - e - λDT de estos usuarios. Finalmente, en el caso (iii) esperamos que lleguen los usuarios de λATC durante el curso del ciclo publicitario. Por lo tanto, la combinación de estos tres factores da una expresión para el número esperado de usuarios que estarán presentes dentro de un ciclo publicitario de longitud TC, que comienza en el tiempo t en el futuro, dado que hay n usuarios actualmente presentes: nn, t= ne - λdt + λa λd 1 - e - λdt + λatc (3) Tenga en cuenta que a medida que t aumenta los resultados se vuelven menos dependientes del número inicial de usuarios, n.El número medio de usuarios presentes en cualquier momento es simplemente λA/λd, y el número medio de usuarios expuestos a un anuncio en cualquier ciclo publicitario viene dado por λA TC + 1 λd.5.2 Predecir la probabilidad de ganar además de estimar el número de usuarios que estarán presentes en cualquier ciclo publicitario, un agente de licitación efectivo también debe poder predecir la probabilidad de ganar una subasta dado que presenta cualquier oferta específica. Este es un problema común dentro de los agentes de licitación, y los enfoques generalmente pueden clasificarse como teóricos o teóricos de la decisión del juego. Dado que nuestros agentes publicitarios desconocen el número o la identidad de la publicidad competitiva 6 Nota que no requerimos que un usuario esté presente para todo el ciclo publicitario para ser contado como presente.266 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y agentes de sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), el enfoque teórico del juego está excluido. Por lo tanto, adoptamos un enfoque teórico de decisión similar al adoptado dentro de subastas dobles continuas donde los agentes de licitación estiman el precio de mercado de los bienes al observar los precios de las transacciones [4]. Por lo tanto, nuestros agentes publicitarios usan una función parametrizada para describir la probabilidad de ganar la subasta dada cualquier oferta presentada, p (b). Esta función debe tener soporte [0, ∞) ya que las ofertas deben ser positivas. Además, esperamos que exhiba mediante una curva en forma de S por la cual la probabilidad de ganar una subasta es pequeña cuando la oferta presentada es muy baja, la probabilidad es cercana a una cuando la oferta es muy alta y hay un punto de transición quecaracteriza el cambio de una oferta de pérdida a una victoria. Con este fin, usamos la forma acumulativa de la distribución gamma para esta función: p (b) = γ (k, b/θ) γ (k) (4) donde γ (k) es la función gamma estándar y γ(k, b/θ) es la función gamma incompleta. Esta función tiene las propiedades necesarias descritas anteriormente y tiene dos parámetros, K y θ. El punto de transición donde p (b) = 0.5 viene dado por Kθ y la nitidez de la transición se describe por Kθ2. En la Figura 4 mostramos ejemplos de esta función para tres valores diferentes de k y θ. El agente publicitario elige los valores más apropiados de K y θ al ajustar la función de probabilidad a las observaciones de subastas anteriores. Una observación es un par {bi, oi} que consiste en la oferta, bi y un resultado de la subasta, oi. Cada subasta genera al menos un par en el que BI es igual al precio de cierre de la subasta, y OI = 1. Además, se genera otro par para cada oferta fallida presentada por el propio agente de publicidad, y en este caso OI = 0. Por lo tanto, habiendo recolectado n tales pares7, el agente encuentra los valores de k y θ evaluando: arg min k, θ n i = 1 oi - γ (k, bi/θ) γ (k) 2 (5) Esta expresión puedeno ser evaluado analíticamente, pero se puede encontrar simplemente utilizando un método de descenso de gradiente numérico por el cual los valores de K y θ se estiman inicialmente utilizando su relación con el punto de transición descrito anteriormente. El gradiente de esta expresión se evalúa numéricamente en estos puntos, y nuevas estimaciones de k y θ calculadas haciendo un movimiento de tamaño fijo en la dirección del gradiente máximo. Este proceso se repite hasta que K y θ hayan convergido con un grado apropiado de precisión.5.3 Utilidad esperada de un ciclo publicitario El objetivo del agente de publicidad es obtener la máxima exposición para su anuncio dado su presupuesto restringido. Definimos la utilidad de cualquier ciclo publicitario como el número esperado de usuarios que verán el anuncio por primera vez durante ese ciclo y, por lo tanto, asumimos explícitamente que no se deriva ninguna utilidad adicional al mostrar el anuncio a ningún usuario más de una vez8. Por lo tanto, podemos usar los resultados de las dos secciones anteriores para calcular la utilidad esperada de cada ciclo publicitario que queda dentro del período de los agentes publicitarios de 7 En el caso de que no se han observado ofertas que no se han observado, no hay evidencia de dónde el punto de transición entreEs probable que ocurran ofertas exitosas y no exitosas. Por lo tanto, en este caso, un par adicional con valor {α Min (B1 ... Bn), 0} se crea automáticamente. Aquí α ∈ [0, 1] determina qué tan por debajo de la oferta más baja exitosa, el agente publicitario cree que es el punto de transición. Normalmente hemos usado α = 0.5 dentro de nuestros experimentos.8 Como se señaló anteriormente, suponemos que un usuario ha visto el anuncio si está presente durante cualquier parte del ciclo publicitario, y no diferenciamos entre los usuarios que ven todo el anuncio, o usuarios que ven una fracción de él.0 10 20 30 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probabilidad de la subasta ganadora P (B) Bid (B) K = 5 K = 10 K = 20 Figura 4: Distribución gamma acumulada que representa la probabilidad de ganar una subasta (θ = 1 y yK = 5, 10 y 20).interés. En el primer ciclo publicitario, esto simplemente está determinado por la probabilidad de que el agente de publicidad gane la subasta, dado que presenta una oferta B1 y el número de usuarios que actualmente están frente a la pantalla Bluscreen, pero no han visto el anuncio antes, es n.Por lo tanto, la utilidad esperada de este ciclo publicitario se describe simplemente con: U1 = P (B1) nn, 0 (6) Ahora, en el segundo ciclo publicitario, la utilidad esperada dependerá claramente del resultado de la subasta para el primero. Si el agente realmente ganó la primera subasta, entonces no habrá usuarios que aún no hayan visto el anuncio presente al comienzo del segundo ciclo publicitario. Por lo tanto, en este caso, N0,0 describe el número esperado de nuevos usuarios que verán el anuncio en el segundo ciclo publicitario (es decir, solo los usuarios recién llegados contribuirán con cualquier utilidad). Por el contrario, si el agente no ganó la primera subasta, entonces el número esperado de usuarios que aún no han visto el anuncio están dados por NN, TC, donde TC es la longitud del ciclo de advertencia anterior (es decir, exactamente el caso descrito enSección 5.1 Donde hay N usuarios inicialmente presentes y el ciclo publicitario comienza a la vez TC en el futuro). Por lo tanto, la utilidad esperada del segundo ciclo publicitario viene dada por: U2 = P (B2) [P (B1) N0,0 + (1 - P (B1)) Nn, TC] (7) Podemos generalizar este resultado porobservar que el número de usuarios que se espera que estén presentes dentro de cualquier ciclo publicitario futuro dependerá de la cantidad de ciclos, ya que se ganó una subasta por última vez (ya que en este punto el número de usuarios que están presentes pero no han visto el anuncio debe ser igual.cero). Por lo tanto, debemos sumar sobre todas las formas posibles en las que esto puede ocurrir, y peso cada uno por su probabilidad. Por lo tanto, el caso general para cualquier ciclo publicitario se describe mediante la expresión bastante compleja: ui = p (bi) i - 1 j = 1 n0, (i - j - 1) tc p (bj) i - 1 m = j+1 (1 - P (BM)) + Nn, (I - 1) TC I - 1 M = 1 (1 - P (BM)) (8) Por lo tanto, dada esta expresión, el objetivo del agente publicitario es calcularLa secuencia de ofertas sobre las subastas restantes C, de modo que se maximiza la utilidad total esperada, al tiempo que se asegura de que el presupuesto restante, B, no se exceda: Arg Max B1 ... BC C I = 1 UI tal que C I = 1 BI =B (9) El sexto intl.

Habiendo calculado esta secuencia, se presenta una oferta de B1 en la próxima subasta. Una vez que se conoce el resultado de esta subasta, el proceso se repite con una nueva secuencia óptima de ofertas que se calculan para los ciclos publicitarios restantes del período de intereses de los agentes.5.4 La secuencia óptima de las ofertas que resuelven para la secuencia óptima de las BID expresadas en la Ecuación 9 no se puede realizar analíticamente. En su lugar, desarrollamos una rutina numérica para realizar esta maximización. Sin embargo, es informativo considerar inicialmente el caso simple de solo dos subastas.5.4.1 Ejemplo de dos subastas En este caso, la utilidad esperada del agente publicitario simplemente está dado por U1 + U2 (como se describe en las ecuaciones 6 y 7), y la secuencia de licitación depende únicamente de B1 (ya que B2 = B - B1). Por lo tanto, podemos trazar la utilidad total esperada contra B1 y determinar gráficamente el valor óptimo de B1 (y, por lo tanto, también B2). Para este fin, la Figura 5 muestra un ejemplo calculado usando los valores de parámetros λA = 1/120, λd = 1/480 y TC = 120. En este caso, suponemos que k = 10 y θ = 1, y por lo tanto, dado que Kθ describe el punto medio de la distribución gamma acumulada, una oferta de 10 representa una probabilidad del 50% de ganar cualquier subasta (es decir, P (10) = 0.5). Además, suponemos que n = λA/λd = 4, y por lo tanto, el número inicial de usuarios presentes es igual al número medio que esperamos encontrar presente en cualquier momento. La gráfica indica que cuando el presupuesto es pequeño, entonces la utilidad máxima se logra en los valores extremos de B1. Esto corresponde a ofertar en solo una de las dos subastas (es decir, B1 = 0 y B2 = B o B1 = B y B2 = 0). Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta el presupuesto, la gráfica pasa a través de una transición por la cual la utilidad máxima ocurre en el punto medio del eje X, correspondiente a la licitación por igual en ambas subastas (es decir, B1 = B2 = B/2). Esto se entiende simplemente por el hecho de que continuar asignando el presupuesto a una sola subasta resulta en rendimientos decrecientes a medida que la probabilidad de ganar esta subasta se acerca a una. En este caso, el gráfico es completamente simétrico ya que el número de usuarios presentes al inicio es igual a su valor esperado (es decir, n = λA/λd). Sin embargo, si N <λA/λd, la gráfica está sesgada de tal manera que cuando el presupuesto es pequeño, debe asignarse a la segunda subasta (ya que se espera que lleguen más usuarios antes de que comience este ciclo publicitario). Por el contrario, cuando N> λA/λd todo el presupuesto debe asignarse a la primera subasta (ya que los usuarios que están presentes actualmente pueden partir en el futuro cercano). Sin embargo, en ambos casos, se produce una transición mediante el cual dado un presupuesto suficiente, es preferible asignar el presupuesto de manera uniforme entre ambas subastas9.9 De hecho, una subasta todavía se prefiere ligeramente, pero la diferencia en TEMP ← 1 tasa ← 0.995 en negrita ← Asignación aleatoria inicial Uold ← Evalúe (en negrita) mientras TEMP> 0.0001 I, J ← Index de enteros aleatorios dentro de B T ← Número real aleatorio entre0 y bi bnew ← Bold Bnew I ← Bold I - T BNew J ← Bold J + T Unew ← Evaluate (BNew) Si rand <exp ((Unew - - Uold)/temp) luego Bold ← BNEW Uold ← Unew Endif Temp ← temper× tasa de finalización Figura 6: Algoritmo de optimización estocástica para calcular la secuencia óptima de BID en el caso general de subastas múltiples.5.4.2 Caso general En general, el comportamiento visto en el ejemplo anterior caracteriza el comportamiento de licitación óptimo del agente de publicidad. Si hay un presupuesto suficiente, la oferta por igual en todas las subastas da como resultado la utilidad máxima esperada. Sin embargo, generalmente esto no es posible y, por lo tanto, la utilidad se maximiza concentrando qué presupuesto está disponible en un subconjunto de la subasta disponible. La elección de este subconjunto está determinada por varios factores. Si actualmente hay muy pocos usuarios presentes, es óptimo asignar el presupuesto a subastas posteriores en la expectativa de que llegarán más usuarios. Por el contrario, si hay muchos usuarios presentes, se debe asignar una proporción significativa del presupuesto a la primera subasta para garantizar que realmente se gane, y estos usuarios ven el anuncio. Finalmente, dado que no se deriva ninguna utilidad mostrando el anuncio a un solo usuario más de una vez, el presupuesto debe asignarse de tal manera que haya intervalos entre las exhibiciones del anuncio, para que los nuevos usuarios puedan llegar. Ahora, debido a la forma compleja de la expresión para la utilidad esperada del agente (que se muestra en la ecuación 8) no es posible calcular analíticamente la secuencia óptima de BIDS. Sin embargo, el problema inverso (el de calcular la utilidad esperada para cualquier secuencia de ofertas) es fácil. Por lo tanto, podemos usar una rutina de optimización estocástica basada en el recocido simulado para resolver el problema de maximización. Este algoritmo comienza asumiendo una asignación aleatoria inicial de ofertas (normalizado de tal manera que el total de todas las ofertas es igual al presupuesto B). Luego realiza pequeños ajustes a esta asignación transfiriendo aleatoriamente el presupuesto de una subasta a otra. Si esta transferencia da como resultado un aumento en la utilidad esperada, entonces se acepta. Si resulta en una disminución en la utilidad esperada, aún podría ser aceptado, pero con una probabilidad determinada por un parámetro de temperatura. Este parámetro de temperatura se recoce de tal manera que la probabilidad de aceptar tales transferencias disminuye con el tiempo. En la Figura 6 presentamos este algoritmo en pseudo-código.6. Evaluación Para evaluar la efectividad de la estrategia de licitación avanzada desarrollada dentro de este documento comparamos su rendimiento con tres mecanismos alternativos. Uno de estos mecanismos representa una estrategia de licitación alternativa simple para los agentes publicitarios, mientras que los otros dos son mecanismos de asignación centralizados que representan la utilidad esperada entre esta y una asignación uniforme es negliable.268 El sexto intl.

Los resultados se promedian en más de 50 ejecuciones de simulación y las barras de error indican el error estándar en la media.Los límites superiores e inferiores al rendimiento general del sistema. Con más detalle, los cuatro mecanismos que comparamos son: asignación aleatoria: en lugar de implementar el mecanismo de subasta, el ciclo publicitario se asigna aleatoriamente a uno de los agentes publicitarios. Estrategia de licitación simple: implementamos el mecanismo de subasta completa pero con una población de agentes publicitarios que emplean una estrategia de licitación simple. Estos agentes publicitarios no intentan modelar a los usuarios o el entorno de subasta en el que ofertan, sino que simplemente asignan un presupuesto restante sobre los ciclos publicitarios restantes. Estrategia de licitación avanzada: implementamos el mecanismo de subasta completa con una población de agentes publicitarios que utilizan los modelos probabilísticos y la estrategia de licitación descrita aquí. Asignación óptima: en lugar de implementar el mecanismo de subasta, el ciclo publicitario se asigna al agente de publicidad que obtendrá la utilidad máxima de él, dado el conocimiento perfecto de la cantidad de usuarios que llegarán y aparecerán en todos los futuros ciclos publicitarios. Usando estos cuatro mecanismos de asignación alternativa, ejecutamos simulaciones repetidas de dos horas de funcionamiento de todo el entorno Bluscreen para un conjunto predeterminado de parámetros por los cuales la tasa de llegada y salida de los usuarios está dada por λA = 1/120S y λD = 1/480S, y la duración de un ciclo publicitario es de 120s. A cada agente de publicidad se le asigna un anuncio con un período de interés extraído de una distribución de Poisson con una media de 8 ciclos publicitarios, y a estos agentes se les asigna inicialmente un presupuesto igual a 10 veces su período de interés. Para cada ejecución de simulación, medimos la exposición media normalizada de cada anuncio. Es decir, la fracción de usuarios que fueron detectados por la pantalla de la pantalla azul durante el período de interés del agente publicitario que realmente estuvieron expuestos al anuncio de los agentes. Por lo tanto, una exposición media normalizada de 1 indica que el agente logró exponer su anuncio a todos los usuarios que estuvieron presentes durante su período de interés (y una exposición media normalizada de 0 significa que ningún usuario estuvo expuesto al anuncio). La Figura 7 muestra los resultados de estos experimentos. Primero observamos el resultado general de que a medida que aumenta el número de agentes publicitarios y, por lo tanto, aumenta la competencia entre ellos, entonces la exposición normal normalizada de todos los mecanismos de asignación disminuye. Luego observamos que en todos los casos, no hay una mejora estadísticamente significativa en el uso de la estrategia de licitación simple en comparación con la asignación aleatoria (P> 0.25 en la prueba t de los estudiantes). Dado que esta estrategia de licitación simple no tiene en cuenta el número de usuarios presentes y, en general, simplemente aumenta su precio de oferta en cada subasta hasta que gane uno, esto no es inesperado. Sin embargo, en todos los casos, la estrategia de licitación avanzada supera significativamente al agente de licitación simple (P <0,0005 en la prueba t de Students), y su rendimiento está dentro del 7.5% de la asignación óptima que tiene un conocimiento perfecto del número de usuariosquien llegará y partirá en todos los futuros ciclos de publicidad. Además, presentamos los resultados de los experimentos realizados en un rango de valores de parámetros, y también con una población mixta de agentes publicitarios que utilizan las estrategias de licitación avanzadas y simples. Este es un escenario importante ya que los anunciantes pueden desear suministrar sus propios agentes de licitación y, por lo tanto, no está garantizada una población homogénea. En cada caso, manteniendo todos los demás parámetros fijos, variamos un parámetro, y estos resultados se muestran en la Figura 8. En general, vemos las tendencias similares que antes. El aumento de la tasa de salida provoca una disminución en la exposición normalizada, ya que los agentes de publicidad tienen menos oportunidades para exponer a los usuarios a sus anuncios. El aumento del período de interés de cada agente disminuye la exposición normalizada, ya que más agentes publicitarios ahora compiten por los mismos usuarios. Finalmente, aumentar la tasa de llegada de los usuarios hace que los resultados de las estrategias de licitación simples y avanzadas se aborden entre sí, ya que la varianza en el número de usuarios que están presentes durante cualquier ciclo publicitario disminuye y, por lo tanto, modelar su comportamiento proporciona menos ganancia.. Sin embargo, en todos los casos, la estrategia de licitación avanzada supera significativamente la simple (P <0,0005 en la prueba t de los estudiantes). En promedio, observamos que los agentes publicitarios que usan la estrategia de licitación avanzada pueden exponer sus anuncios a un 25% más de usuarios que aquellos que usan la estrategia de licitación simple. Finalmente, mostramos que un agente de publicidad racional, que tiene la opción de la estrategia de licitación, siempre optaría por usar la estrategia de licitación avanzada sobre la estrategia de licitación simple, independientemente de la composición de la población en la que se encuentre. La Figura 9 muestra la exposición promedio normalizada de los agentes publicitarios cuando la población está compuesta de diferentes fracciones de las dos estrategias de licitación. En cada caso, la estrategia de licitación avanzada muestra una ganancia significativa en el rendimiento en comparación con la estrategia de licitación simple (P <0,0005 en la prueba t de los estudiantes) y, por lo tanto, las ganancias mejoran la exposición en todas las composiciones de la población.7. Conclusiones En este documento, presentamos una estrategia de licitación avanzada para el uso de agentes publicitarios dentro del sistema de publicidad Bluscreen. Esta estrategia de licitación permitió a los agentes de publicidad modelar y predecir la llegada y la salida de los usuarios, y también modelar su éxito dentro de una subasta de oferta sellada en primer precio al observar ambas ofertas que ellos mismos presentaron y la oferta ganadora.

Presentamos un algoritmo basado en el recocido simulado para resolver la estrategia de licitación óptima, y en la simulación, se demostró que esta estrategia de licitación supera significativamente una estrategia de licitación simple que no tenía ninguna de estas características. Su rendimiento se acercó estrechamente a la de una asignación óptima central, con un conocimiento perfecto de la llegada y la salida de los usuarios, a pesar del entorno incierto en el que debe operar la estrategia. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área consiste en extender esta estrategia de licitación a entornos más ricos donde hay múltiples pantallas de pantalla interrelacionadas, donde el mantenimiento de los perfiles de los usuarios permite que se anuncie una coincidencia más rica del usuario, y donde se aplican mecanismos de subasta alternativos (estamos particularmente interesantes enIntroducción de una configuración de subasta de pago por usuario similar a las subastas de pago por clic empleadas por los sitios web de búsqueda en Internet). Este trabajo continuará realizándose junto con el despliegue de más prototipos Bluscreen para obtener más experiencia en el mundo real.8.

        "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
        "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
        "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
        "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
        "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
        "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
        "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
        "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
        "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
        "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
        "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
        "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
        "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
        "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
        "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
        "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
        "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
        "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
        "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
        "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",

        "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
        "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
        "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
        "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
        "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
        "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
        "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
        "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
        "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",
        "Gerding et al. present a simulated system (CASy) whereby a Vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2].",
        "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
        "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
        "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
        "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
        "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
        "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
        "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
        "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
        "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
        "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
        "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
        "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
        "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",
        "The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4.",
        "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",
        "To date, a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has been demonstrated [8].",
        "This system uses a 23 inch flat-screen display deployed within an office environment to advertise events and news items.",
        "Rather than requiring the deployment of specialised hardware, such as active badges (see [11] for details), BluScreen detects the presence of users in the vicinity of each display through the Bluetooth-enabled devices that they carry with them everyday1 . 1 Devices must be in discovery mode to detectable. 264 The Sixth Intl.",

        "This approach is attractive since the Bluetooth wireless protocol is characterised by its relative maturity, market penetration, and emphasis on short-range communication.",
        "Table 1 summarises the number of devices detected by this prototype installation over a six month period.",
        "Of the 212 Bluetooth devices detected, approximately 70 were detected regularly, showing that Bluetooth is a suitable proxy for detecting individuals in front of the screen.",
        "In order to achieve a scalable and extendable solution a multiagent systems design philosophy is adopted whereby a number of different agents types interact (see figure 2).",
        "The interactions of these agents are implemented through a web services protocol2 , and they constitute a decentralised marketplace that allocates advertising space in an efficient and timely manner.",
        "In more detail, the responsibilities of each agent types are: Bluetooth Device Detection Agent: This agent monitors the environment in the vicinity of a BluScreen display and determines the number and identity of any Bluetooth devices that are close by.",
        "It keeps historical records of the arrival and departure of Bluetooth devices, and makes this information available to advertising agents as requested.",
        "Marketplace Agent: This agent facilitates the sale of advertising space to the advertising agents.",
        "A single marketplace agent represents each BluScreen display, and access to this screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles of fixed duration.",
        "Before the start of each advertising cycle, the marketplace agent holds a sealed-bid auction (see section 4 for more details).",
        "The winner of this auction is allocated access to the display during the next cycle.",
        "Advertising Agent: This agent represents a single advert and is responsible for submitting bids to the marketplace agent in order that it may be allocated advertising cycles, and thus, display its advert to users.",
        "It interacts with the device detection agent in order to collect information regarding the number and identity of users who are currently in front of the display.",
        "On the basis of this information, its past experiences, and its bidding strategy, it calculates the value of the bid that it should submit to the marketplace agent.",
        "Thus, having described the prototype BluScreen system, we next go on to describe the details of the auction mechanism that we consider in this work, and then the advanced bidding agent that operates bids within this auction. 4.",
        "THE AUCTION MECHANISM As described above, BluScreen is designed to efficiency allocate advertising cycles in a distributed and timely manner.",
        "Thus, oneshot sealed bid auctions are used for the market mechanism of the marketplace agent.",

        "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
        "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
        "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
        "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",
        "Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .",
        "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",
        "The marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each advertising agent.",
        "At the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not announced to all observers).",
        "In the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed.",
        "Having described the market mechanism that the marketplace agent implements, we now go on to describe and evaluate an advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents to adopt. 5.",
        "ADVANCED BIDDING STRATEGY As described above, we consider the case that the advertising agents do not have an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing the advert to a single user.",
        "Rather, they have a constrained budget, B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to display their advert.",
        "Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the exposure of their advert.",
        "In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events.",
        "It will be uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 3 This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 265 is known, some may leave before the advert commences, and others may arrive.",
        "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
        "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
        "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
        "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
        "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
        "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
        "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
        "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",
        "This represents a simple model that is commonly applied within queuing theory5 [5], yet is one that we believe well describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in communal areas where people meet and congregate.",
        "Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd.",
        "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
        "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",
        "Our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users. 0 t t + tc τ (i) n users ? (iii) λatc users ? (ii) λat users ?",
        "Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc, commencing at time t in the future.",
        "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
        "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
        "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
        "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
        "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
        "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
        "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
        "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
        "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
        "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
        "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
        "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",
        "Since our advertising agents are unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 6 Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire advertising cycle in order to be counted as present. 266 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded.",
        "Thus, we take a decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price of goods by observing transaction prices [4].",
        "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
        "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
        "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
        "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
        "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
        "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
        "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
        "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
        "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
        "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
        "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
        "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
        "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
        "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
        "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",
        "Thus, we can use the results of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agents period of 7 In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is no evidence of where the transition point between successful and unsuccessful bids is likely to occur.",
        "Thus, in this case, an additional pair with value {α min(b1 . . . bn), 0} is automatically created.",
        "Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be.",
        "We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest.",
        "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
        "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
        "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
        "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
        "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
        "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
        "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

        "Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next auction.",
        "Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for the remaining advertising cycles of the agents period of interest. 5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9 can not be performed analytically.",
        "Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation.",
        "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
        "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",
        "To this end, figure 5 shows an example calculated using parameter values λa = 1/120, λd = 1/480 and tc = 120.",
        "In this case, we assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e.",
        "P(10) = 0.5).",
        "In addition, we assume that n = λa/λd = 4, and thus the initial number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect to find present at any time.",
        "The plot indicates that when the budget is small, then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values of b1.",
        "This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0).",
        "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
        "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
        "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
        "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
        "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",
        "However, in both cases, a transition occurs whereby given sufficient budget it is preferable to allocate the budget evenly between both auctions9 . 9 In fact, one auction is still slightly preferred, but the difference in temp ← 1 rate ← 0.995 bold ← initial random allocation Uold ← Evaluate(bold ) WHILE temp > 0.0001 i, j ← random integer index within b t ← random real number between 0 and bi bnew ← bold bnew i ← bold i − t bnew j ← bold j + t Unew ← Evaluate(bnew ) IF rand < exp((Unew − Uold )/temp) THEN bold ← bnew Uold ← Unew ENDIF temp ← temp × rate ENDWHILE Figure 6: Stochastic optimisation algorithm to calculate the optimal sequence of bids in the general case of multiple auctions. 5.4.2 General Case In general, the behaviour seen in the previous example characterises the optimal bidding behaviour of the advertising agent.",
        "If there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in the maximum expected utility.",
        "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
        "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
        "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
        "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
        "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
        "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",
        "However, the inverse problem (that of calculating the expected utility for any given sequence of bids) is easy.",
        "Thus, we can use a stochastic optimisation routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation problem.",
        "This algorithm starts by assuming some initial random allocation of bids (normalised such that the total of all the bids is equal to the budget B).",
        "It then makes small adjustments to this allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to another.",
        "If this transfer results in an increase in expected utility, then it is accepted.",
        "If it results in a decrease in expected utility, it might still be accepted, but with a probability that is determined by a temperature parameter.",

        "In more detail, the four mechanisms that we compare are: Random Allocation: Rather than implementing the auction mechanism, the advertising cycle is randomly allocated to one of the advertising agents.",
        "Simple Bidding Strategy: We implement the full auction mechanism but with a population of advertising agents that employ a simple bidding strategy.",
        "These advertising agents do not attempt to model the users or the auction environment in which they bid, but rather, they simply evenly allocate their remaining budget over the remaining advertising cycles.",
        "Advanced Bidding Strategy: We implement the full auction mechanism with a population of advertising agents using the probabilistic models and the bidding strategy described here.",
        "Optimal Allocation: Rather than implementing the auction mechanism, the advertising cycle is allocated to the advertising agent that will derive the maximum utility from it, given perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrive and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
        "Using these four alternative allocation mechanisms, we ran repeated simulations of two hours of operation of the entire BluScreen environment for a default set of parameters whereby the arrival and departure rate of the users are given by λa = 1/120s and λd = 1/480s, and the length of an advertising cycle is 120s.",
        "Each advertising agent is assigned an advert with a period of interest drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 8 advertising cycles, and these agents are initially allocated a budget equal to 10 times their period of interest.",
        "For each simulation run, we measure the mean normalised exposure of each advert.",
        "That is, the fraction of users who were detected by the BluScreen display during the period of interest of the advertising agent who were actually exposed to the agents advert.",
        "Thus a mean normalised exposure of 1 indicates that the agent managed to expose its advert to all of the users who were present during its period of interest (and a mean normalised exposure of 0 means that no users were exposed to the advert).",
        "Figure 7 shows the results of this experiments.",
        "We first observe the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases, and thus the competition between them increases, then the mean normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases.",
        "We then observe that in all cases, there is no statistically significant improvement in using the simple bidding strategy compared to random allocation (p > 0.25 in Students t-test).",
        "Since this simple bidding strategy does not take account of the number of users present, and in general, simply increases its bid price in each auction until it does in fact win one, this is not unexpected.",
        "However, in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and its performance is within 7.5% of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
        "In addition, we present results of experiments performed over a range of parameter values, and also with a mixed population of advertising agents using both the advanced and simple bidding strategies.",
        "This is an important scenario since advertisers may wish to supply their own bidding agents, and thus, a homogeneous population is not guaranteed.",
        "In each case, keeping all other parameters fixed, we varied one parameter, and these results are shown in figure 8.",
        "In general, we see the similar trends as before.",
        "Increasing the departure rate causes an decrease in the mean normalised exposure since advertising agents have less opportunities to expose users to their adverts.",
        "Increasing the period of interest of each agent decreases the mean normalised exposure, since more advertising agents are now competing for the same users.",
        "Finally, increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.",
        "However, in all cases, the advanced bidding strategy significantly outperforms the simple one (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test).",
        "On average, we observe that advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy.",
        "Finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in.",
        "Figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two bidding strategies.",
        "In each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by advertising agents within the BluScreen advertising system.",
        "This bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict the arrival and departure of users, and also to model their success within a first-price sealed bid auction by observing both the bids that they themselves submitted and the winning bid.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an <br>advanced bidding agent</br> that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an <br>advanced bidding agent</br> that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",

                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",

                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named <br>bluscreen</br>, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for <br>bluscreen</br> installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype <br>bluscreen</br> system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
                "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",
                "Gerding et al. present a simulated system (CASy) whereby a Vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2].",
                "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the <br>bluscreen</br> Figure 1: A deployed <br>bluscreen</br> prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype <br>bluscreen</br> system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE <br>bluscreen</br> PROTOTYPE <br>bluscreen</br> is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",
                "The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4.",
                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",

                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",

The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",

                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",

                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the <br>bluscreen</br> display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "In this case, we assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e.",

                "This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0).",
                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
                "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
                "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
                "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",

                "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",

                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",

                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the <br>bluetooth</br> enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
                "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",

                "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",
                "The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4.",
                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",
                "Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .",
                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",

                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",

                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
                "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",

                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",

                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
                "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
                "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
                "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",

                "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",
                "The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4.",
                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",
                "To date, a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has been demonstrated [8].",
                "This system uses a 23 inch flat-screen display deployed within an office environment to advertise events and news items.",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",
                "Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .",
                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",
                "The marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each advertising agent.",
                "At the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not announced to all observers).",
                "In the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed.",

                "Rather, they have a constrained budget, B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to display their advert.",
                "Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the exposure of their advert.",
                "In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events.",
                "It will be uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 3 This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a <br>probabilistic model</br>, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a <br>probabilistic model</br> of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",

                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a <br>probabilistic model</br> for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",

                "Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd.",
                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
                "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",

                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",

                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
                "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
                "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",

                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",

                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",

                "In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",

                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",
                "Since our advertising agents are unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 6 Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire advertising cycle in order to be counted as present. 266 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded.",
                "Thus, we take a decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price of goods by observing transaction prices [4].",
                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",
                "Thus, we can use the results of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agents period of 7 In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is no evidence of where the transition point between successful and unsuccessful bids is likely to occur.",
                "Thus, in this case, an additional pair with value {α min(b1 . . . bn), 0} is automatically created.",
                "Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be.",
                "We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest.",
                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next auction.",
                "Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for the remaining advertising cycles of the agents period of interest. 5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9 can not be performed analytically.",
                "Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation.",
                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",
                "To this end, figure 5 shows an example calculated using parameter values λa = 1/120, λd = 1/480 and tc = 120.",
                "In this case, we assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e.",
                "P(10) = 0.5).",
                "In addition, we assume that n = λa/λd = 4, and thus the initial number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect to find present at any time.",
                "The plot indicates that when the budget is small, then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values of b1.",
                "This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0).",
                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "If there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in the maximum expected utility.",
                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
                "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
                "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",
                "However, the inverse problem (that of calculating the expected utility for any given sequence of bids) is easy.",
                "Thus, we can use a stochastic optimisation routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation problem.",
                "This algorithm starts by assuming some initial random allocation of bids (normalised such that the total of all the bids is equal to the budget B).",
                "It then makes small adjustments to this allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to another.",
                "If this transfer results in an increase in expected utility, then it is accepted.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",

                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",

                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",

                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",

                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",
                "This represents a simple model that is commonly applied within queuing theory5 [5], yet is one that we believe well describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in communal areas where people meet and congregate.",
                "Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd.",
                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
                "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",

                "Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc, commencing at time t in the future.",
                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",

                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",

Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next auction.",
                "Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for the remaining advertising cycles of the agents period of interest. 5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9 can not be performed analytically.",
                "Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation.",
                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",

                "P(10) = 0.5).",

                "This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0).",
                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "If there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in the maximum expected utility.",
                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",
                "Conversely, if there are many users present, a significant proportion of the budget should be allocated to the first auction to ensure that it is indeed won, and these users see the advert.",
                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",
                "Now, due to the complex form of the expression for the expected utility of the agent (shown in equation 8) it is not possible to analytically calculate the optimal sequence of bids.",
                "However, the inverse problem (that of calculating the expected utility for any given sequence of bids) is easy.",
                "Thus, we can use a stochastic optimisation routine based on simulated annealing to solve the maximisation problem.",
                "This algorithm starts by assuming some initial random allocation of bids (normalised such that the total of all the bids is equal to the budget B).",
                "It then makes small adjustments to this allocation by randomly transferring the budget from one auction to another.",

                "It then uses these models to maximise the exposure that its adverts receive.",
                "We evaluate the effectiveness of this bidding agent through simulation against a range of alternative selection mechanisms including a simple bidding strategy, random allocation, and a centralised optimal allocation with perfect foresight.",
                "Our bidding agent significantly outperforms both the simple bidding strategy and the random allocation, and in a mixed population of agents it is able to expose its adverts to 25% more users than the simple bidding strategy.",
                "Moreover, its performance is within 7.5% of that of the centralised optimal allocation despite the highly uncertain environment in which it must operate.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a <br>decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism</br> is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",

                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",

                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",

                "Before the start of each advertising cycle, the marketplace agent holds a sealed-bid auction (see section 4 for more details).",
                "The winner of this auction is allocated access to the display during the next cycle.",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",
                "Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .",
                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",
                "The marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each advertising agent.",
                "At the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not announced to all observers).",
                "In the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed.",

                "Rather, they have a constrained budget, B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to display their advert.",
                "Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the exposure of their advert.",
                "In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events.",
                "It will be uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 3 This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",
                "This represents a simple model that is commonly applied within queuing theory5 [5], yet is one that we believe well describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in communal areas where people meet and congregate.",
                "Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd.",
                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
                "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",
                "Our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users. 0 t t + tc τ (i) n users ? (iii) λatc users ? (ii) λat users ?",
                "Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc, commencing at time t in the future.",
                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",
                "Since our advertising agents are unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 6 Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire advertising cycle in order to be counted as present. 266 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded.",
                "Thus, we take a decision theoretic approach similar to that adopted within continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price of goods by observing transaction prices [4].",
                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",

                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",

                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",

                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",

                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",

                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",
                "Thus, we can use the results of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agents period of 7 In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is no evidence of where the transition point between successful and unsuccessful bids is likely to occur.",

                "We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest.",
                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",

                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",

                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",

                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",

                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the auction allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",
                "Attempts to apply these approaches within the real world have been much more limited.",
                "Gerding et al. present a simulated system (CASy) whereby a Vickrey auction mechanism is used to sell advertising space within a modelled electronic shopping mall [2].",
                "The auction is used to rank a set of possible advertisements provided by different retail outlets, and the top ranking advertisements are selected for presentation on public displays.",
                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",
                "Users should be identified by existing ubiquitous, consumer devices, so that future deployments within public arenas will not require uptake of new hardware. 3.",
                "The number of displays should be scalable, such that adverts appear on different displays at different times. 4.",
                "Knowledge about observed behaviour and composition of the audience should be exploited to facilitate inference of user interests which can be exploited by the system.",
                "To date, a prototype systems that addresses the first two goals has been demonstrated [8].",

                "The interactions of these agents are implemented through a web services protocol2 , and they constitute a decentralised marketplace that allocates advertising space in an efficient and timely manner.",

                "Before the start of each advertising cycle, the marketplace agent holds a sealed-bid auction (see section 4 for more details).",

                "However, as described earlier, in this paper we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a single user.",
                "This may be because the BluScreen installation is within a private organisation where what is being advertised (e.g. news items or forthcoming events) has no monetary value, or it may be a new commercial installation where limited market experience makes estimating such a valuation impossible.",
                "In the absence of such a valuation, the attractive economic properties of the second-price auction can not be achieved in practise, and thus, in our work there is no need to limit our attention to the second-price auction.",
                "Indeed, since these auctions are actually extremely rare within real world settings [10], in this work we consider the more widely adopted first-price auction since this increases the applicability of our results.",
                "Thus, in more detail, we consider an instance of a BluScreen installation with a single display screen that is managed by a single marketplace agent3 .",
                "We consider that access to the display screen is divided into discrete advertising cycles, each of length tc, and a first-price sealed bid auction is held immediately prior to the start of each advertising cycle.",
                "The marketplace agent announces the start and deadline of the auction, and collects sealed bids from each advertising agent.",
                "At the closing time of the auction the marketplace agent announces to all participants and observers the amount of the winning bid, and informs the winning advertising agent that it was successful (the identity of the winning advertising agent is not announced to all observers).",
                "In the case that no bids are placed within any auction, a default advert is displayed.",

                "Rather, they have a constrained budget, B, and a limited period of interest during which they wish to display their advert.",
                "Their goal is then to find the appropriate amount to bid within each auction in this period, in order to maximise the exposure of their advert.",
                "In attempting to achieve this goal the advertising agent is faced with a high level of uncertainty about future events.",
                "It will be uncertain of the number of users who will be present during any advertising cycle since even if the number of users currently present 3 This assumption of having a single BluScreen instance is made to simplify our task of validating the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed mechanism and strategy, and generalising these results to the case of multiple screens is the aim of our future work.",

                "Moreover, the amount that must be bid to ensure that an auction is won is uncertain since it depends on the number and behaviour of the competing advertising agents.",
                "Thus, we enable the agent to use its observations of the arrival and departure of users to build a probabilistic model, based upon independent Poisson processes, that describes the number of users who are likely to be exposed to any advert.",
                "In addition, we enable the agent to observe the outcome of previous advertising cycle auctions, and use the observations of the closing price, and the success or otherwise of the bids that it itself submitted, to build a probabilistic model of the bid required to win the auction.",
                "The agent then uses these two models to calculate its expected utility in each advertising cycle, and in turn, determine the optimal sequence of bids that maximises this utility given its constrained budget.",
                "Having calculated this sequence of bids, then the first bid in the sequence is actually used in the auction for the next advertising cycle.",
                "However, at the close of this cycle, the process is repeated with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated in order take to account of what actually happened in the preceding auction (i.e. whether the bid was successful or not, and how many users arrived or departed).",
                "Thus, in the next three subsections we describe these two probabilistic models, and their application within the bidding strategy of the advertising agent. 5.1 Predicting the Number of Users In order to predict the number of users that will be present in any future advertising cycle, it is necessary to propose a probabilistic model for the behaviour of the users.",
                "Thus, our advanced bidding strategy assumes that their arrival and departures are determined by two independent Poisson processes4 with arrival rate, λa, and departure rate, λd.",
                "This represents a simple model that is commonly applied within queuing theory5 [5], yet is one that we believe well describes the case where BluScreen displays are placed in communal areas where people meet and congregate.",
                "Given the history of users arrivals and departures obtained from the device detection agent, the advertising agent makes a maximum likelihood estimation of the values of λa and λd.",
                "In more detail, if the advertising agent has observed n users arriving within a time period t, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the arrival rate λa is simply given by: λa = n t (1) Likewise, if an agent observes n users each with a duration of stay of t1, t2, . . . , tn time periods, then the maximum likelihood estimation for the departure rate λd is given by: 1 λd = 1 n n i=1 ti (2) 4 Given a Poisson distribution with rate parameter λ, the number of events, n, within an interval of time t is given by: P(n) = e−λt (λt)n n!",
                "In addition, the probability of having to wait a period of time, t, before the next event is determined by: P(t) = λeλt 5 Note however that in queuing theory it is typically the arrival rate and service times of customers that are modelled as Poisson processes.",
                "Our users are not actually modelled as a queue since the duration of their stay is independent of that of the other users. 0 t t + tc τ (i) n users ? (iii) λatc users ? (ii) λat users ?",
                "Figure 3: Example showing how to predict the number of users who see an advert shown in an advertising cycle of length tc, commencing at time t in the future.",
                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",
                "Now, considering case (i) above, the probability of one of the n users still being present when the advertising cycle starts is given by ∞ t λde−λdτ dτ = e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect ne−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "In case (ii), we expect λat new users to arrive before the advertising cycle commences, and the probability that any of these will still be there when it actually does so is given by 1 t t 0 e−λd(t−τ) dτ = 1 λdt 1 − e−λdt .",
                "Thus we expect λa λd 1 − e−λdt of these users to be present.",
                "Finally, in case (iii) we expect λatc users to arrive during the course of the advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",
                "This is a common problem within bidding agents, and approaches can generally be classified as game theoretic or decision theoretic.",
                "Since our advertising agents are unaware of the number or identity of the competing advertising 6 Note that we do not require a user to be present for the entire advertising cycle in order to be counted as present. 266 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) agents, the game theoretic approach is precluded.",
                "Thus, we take a <br>decision theoretic approach</br> similar to that adopted within continuous double auctions where bidding agents estimate the market price of goods by observing transaction prices [4].",
                "Thus, our advertising agents uses a parameterised function to describe the probability of winning the auction given any submitted bid, P(b).",
                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",
                "Thus, we can use the results of the previous two sections to calculate the expected utility of each advertising cycle remaining within the advertising agents period of 7 In the case that no unsuccessful bids have been observed, there is no evidence of where the transition point between successful and unsuccessful bids is likely to occur.",
                "Thus, in this case, an additional pair with value {α min(b1 . . . bn), 0} is automatically created.",
                "Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be.",
                "We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest.",
                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "Having calculated this sequence, a bid of b1 is submitted in the next auction.",
                "Once the outcome of this auction is known, the process repeats with a new optimal sequence of bids being calculated for the remaining advertising cycles of the agents period of interest. 5.4 Optimal Sequence of Bids Solving for the optimal sequence of bids expressed in equation 9 can not be performed analytically.",
                "Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation.",
                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",
                "To this end, figure 5 shows an example calculated using parameter values λa = 1/120, λd = 1/480 and tc = 120.",
                "In this case, we assume that k = 10 and θ = 1, and thus, given that kθ describes the midpoint of the cumulative gamma distribution, a bid of 10 represents a 50% chance of winning any auction (i.e.",
                "P(10) = 0.5).",
                "In addition, we assume that n = λa/λd = 4, and thus the initial number of users present is equal to the mean number that we expect to find present at any time.",
                "The plot indicates that when the budget is small, then the maximum utility is achieved at the extreme values of b1.",
                "This corresponds to bidding in just one of the two auctions (i.e. b1 = 0 and b2 = B or b1 = B and b2 = 0).",
                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",

                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",

                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a <br>stochastic optimisation algorithm</br> based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",

                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",

                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",

                "In environments where these rates are subject to change, the agent can use a limited time window over which observations are used to estimate these rates.",
                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",
                "Thus, we consider the problem of predicting this number for an advertising cycle of duration tc that starts at a time t in the future, given that n users are currently present (see figure 3).",
                "This number will be composed of three factors: (i) the fraction of the n users that are initially present who do not leave in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, before the advertising cycle commences, (ii) users that actually arrive in the interval, 0 ≤ τ < t, and are still present when the advertising cycle actually commences, and finally, (iii) users that arrive during the course of the advertising cycle, t ≤ τ < t + tc.",

                "Thus, the combination of these three factors gives an expression for the expected number of users who will be present within an advertising cycle of length tc, that commencing at time t in the future, given that there are n users currently present: Nn,t = ne−λdt + λa λd 1 − e−λdt + λatc (3) Note that as t increases the results become less dependent upon the initial number of users, n. The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",

                "This function must have support [0, ∞) since bids must be positive.",
                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",
                "This function has the necessary properties described above, and has two parameters, k and θ.",
                "The transition point where P(b) = 0.5 is given by kθ and the sharpness of the transition is described by kθ2 .",
                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",
                "In addition, another pair is generated for each unsuccessful bid submitted by the advertising agent itself, and in this case oi = 0.",
                "Thus, having collected N such pairs7 , the agent finds the values of k and θ by evaluating: arg min k,θ N i=1 oi − γ (k, bi/θ) Γ (k) 2 (5) This expression can not be evaluated analytically, but can be simply found using a numerical gradient descent method whereby the values of k and θ are initially estimated using their relationship to the transition point described above.",
                "The gradient of this expression is then numerically evaluated at these points, and new estimates of k and θ calculated by making a fixed size move in the direction of maximum gradient.",
                "This process is repeated until k and θ have converged to an appropriate degree of accuracy. 5.3 Expected Utility of an Advertising Cycle The goal of the advertising agent is to gain the maximum exposure for its advert given its constrained budget.",
                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "Here α ∈ [0, 1] determines how far below the lowest successful bid the advertising agent believes the transition point to be.",
                "We have typically used α = 0.5 within our experiments. 8 As noted before, we assume that a user has seen the advert if they are present during any part of the advertising cycle, and we do not differentiate between users who see the entire advert, or users who see a fraction of it. 0 10 20 30 40 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Probability of Winning Auction P(b) Bid (b) k = 5 k = 10 k = 20 Figure 4: Cumulative gamma distribution representing the probability of winning an auction (θ = 1 and k = 5, 10 & 20). interest.",
                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "Instead we develop a numerical routine to perform this maximisation.",
                "However, it is informative to initially consider the simple case of just two auctions. 5.4.1 Two Auction Example In this case the expected utility of the advertising agent is simply given by u1 + u2 (as described in equations 6 and 7), and the bidding sequence is solely dependent on b1 (since b2 = B−b1).",
                "Thus, we can plot the total expected utility against b1 and graphically determine the optimal value of b1 (and thus also b2).",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",
                "Conversely, when n > λa/λd the entire budget should be allocated to the first auction (since the users who are currently present are likely to depart in the near future).",

                "If there is sufficient budget, bidding equally in all auctions results in the maximum expected utility.",
                "However, typically this is not possible and thus utility is maximised by concentrating what budget is available into a subset of the available auction.",
                "The choice of this subset is determined by a number of factors.",
                "If there are very few users currently present, it is optimal to allocate the budget to later auctions in the expectation that more users will arrive.",

                "Finally, since no utility is derived by showing the advert to a single user more than once, the budget should be allocated such that there are intervals between showings of the advert, in order that new users may arrive.",

                "Using these four alternative allocation mechanisms, we ran repeated simulations of two hours of operation of the entire BluScreen environment for a default set of parameters whereby the arrival and departure rate of the users are given by λa = 1/120s and λd = 1/480s, and the length of an advertising cycle is 120s.",

                "Figure 7 shows the results of this experiments.",

                "Finally, increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.",

                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",

                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",

                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",

                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",
                "Having estimated the arrival and departure rate of users, and knowing the number of users who are present at the current time, the advertising agent is then able to predict the number of users who are likely to be present in any future advertising cycle6 .",

The mean number of users present at any time is simply λa/λd, and the mean number of users exposed to an advert in any advertising cycle is given by λa tc + 1 λd . 5.2 Predicting the Probability of Winning In addition to estimating the number of users who will be present in any advertising cycle, an effective bidding agent must also be able to predict the probability of it winning an auction given that it submits any specified bid.",

                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",

Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",

                "That is, the fraction of users who were detected by the BluScreen display during the period of interest of the advertising agent who were actually exposed to the agents advert.",
                "Thus a mean normalised exposure of 1 indicates that the agent managed to expose its advert to all of the users who were present during its period of interest (and a mean normalised exposure of 0 means that no users were exposed to the advert).",
                "Figure 7 shows the results of this experiments.",
                "We first observe the general result that as the number of advertising agents increases, and thus the competition between them increases, then the mean normalised exposure of all allocation mechanisms decreases.",

                "Since this simple bidding strategy does not take account of the number of users present, and in general, simply increases its bid price in each auction until it does in fact win one, this is not unexpected.",
                "However, in all cases the advanced bidding strategy does indeed significantly outperform the simple bidding agent (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and its performance is within 7.5% of that of the optimal allocation that has perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",

                "Increasing the period of interest of each agent decreases the mean normalised exposure, since more advertising agents are now competing for the same users.",
                "Finally, increasing the arrival rate of the users causes the results of the simple and advanced bidding strategies to approach one another, since the variance in the number of users who are present during any advertising cycle decreases, and thus, modelling their behaviour provides less gain.",
                "However, in all cases, the advanced bidding strategy significantly outperforms the simple one (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test).",
                "On average, we observe that advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy.",
                "Finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in.",

                "In each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 7.",

                "Our bidding agent is able to build probabilistic models of both the behaviour of users who view the adverts, and the auctions that it participates within.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent public display system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent <br>auction</br> mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each public display.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid <br>auction</br>.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the <br>auction</br> environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given <br>auction</br> when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and <br>auction</br>-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",
                "In section 4 we present a detailed description of the <br>auction</br> allocation mechanism, and in section 5 we describe our advanced bidding strategy for the advertising agents.",
                "In section 6 we present an empirical validation of our approach, and finally, we conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The commercial attractiveness of targeted advertising has been amply demonstrated on the internet, where recommendation systems and contextual banner adverts are the norm [1].",
                "These systems typically select content based upon prior knowledge of the individual viewing the material, and such systems work well on personal devices where the owners preferences and interests can be gathered and cached locally, or within interactive environments which utilise some form of credential to identify the user (e.g. e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com).",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",
                "User identification is based on infrared badges and embedded sensors within an office environment.",
                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",
                "Thus, in the next section we describe the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work. 3.",
                "THE BLUSCREEN PROTOTYPE BluScreen is based on the notion of a scalable, extendable, advertising framework whereby adverts can be efficiently displayed to as many relevant users as possible, within a knowledge-poor environment.",
                "To achieve these goals, several requirements have been identified: 1.",
                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",

                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",

                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the <br>auction</br> for the first.",
                "If the first <br>auction</br> was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first <br>auction</br> was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an <br>auction</br> was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single <br>auction</br> results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this <br>auction</br> approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second <br>auction</br> (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",

                "On average, we observe that advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy.",
                "Finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in.",
                "Figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two bidding strategies.",
                "In each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Electronic displays are increasingly being used within public environments, such as airports, city centres and retail stores, in order to advertise commercial products, or to entertain and inform passersby.",
                "Recently, researchers have begun to investigate how the content of such displays may be varied dynamically over time in order to increase its variety, relevance and exposure [9].",
                "Particular research attention has focused on the need to take into account the dynamic nature of the displays audience, and to this end, a number of interactive public displays have been proposed.",
                "These displays have typically addressed the needs of a closed set of known users with pre-defined interests and requirements, and have facilitated communication with these users through the active use of handheld devices such as PDAs or phones [3, 7].",
                "As such, these systems assume prior knowledge about the target audience, and require either that a single user has exclusive access to the display, or that users carry specific tracking devices so that their presence can be identified [6, 11].",
                "However, these approaches fail to work in public spaces, where no prior knowledge regarding the users who may view the display exists, and where such displays need to react to the presence of several users simultaneously.",
                "By contrast, Payne et al. have developed an intelligent <br>public display</br> system, named BluScreen, that detects and tracks users through the Bluetooth enabled devices that they carry with them everyday [8].",
                "Within this system, a decentralised multi-agent auction mechanism is used to efficiently allocate advertising time on each <br>public display</br>.",
                "Each advert is represented by an individual advertising agent that maintains a history of users who have already been exposed to the advert.",
                "This agent then seeks to acquire advertising cycles (during which it can display its advert on the public displays) by submitting bids to a marketplace agent who implements a sealed bid auction.",
                "The value of these bids is based upon the number of users who are currently present in front of the screen, the history of these users, and an externally derived estimate of the value of exposing an advert to a user.",
                "In this paper, we present an advanced bidding agent that significantly extends the sophistication of this approach.",
                "In particular, we consider the more general setting in which it is impossible to determine an a priori valuation for exposing an advert to a user.",
                "This is likely to be the case for BluScreen installations within private organisations where the items being advertised are forthcoming events or news items of interest to employees and visitors, and thus have no direct monetary value (indeed in this case bidding is likely to be conducted in some virtual currency).",
                "In addition, it is also likely to be the case within new commercial installations where limited market experience makes estimating a valuation impossible.",
                "In both cases, it is more appropriate to assume that an advertising agents will be assigned a total advertising budget, and that it will have a limited period of time in which to spend this budget (particularly so where the adverts are for forthcoming events).",
                "The advertising agent is then simply tasked with using this budget to maximum effect (i.e. to achieve the maximum possible advert exposure within this time period).",
                "Now, in order to achieve this goal, the advertising agent must be capable of modelling the behaviour of the users in order to predict the number who will be present in any future advertising cycle.",
                "In addition, it must also understand the auction environment in which 263 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS it competes, in order that it may make best use of its limited budget.",
                "Thus, in developing an advanced bidding agent that achieves this, we advance the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We enable the advertising agents to model the arrival and departure of users as independent Poisson processes, and to make maximum likelihood estimates of the rates of these processes based on their observations.",
                "We show how these agents can then calculate the expected number of users who will be present during any future advertising cycle. 2.",
                "Using a decision theoretic approach we enable the advertising agents to model the probability of winning any given auction when a specific amount is bid.",
                "The cumulative form of the gamma distribution is used to represent this probability, and its parameters are fitted using observations of both the closing price of previous auctions, and the bids that that advertising agent itself submits. 3.",
                "We show that our explicit assumption that the advertising agent derives no additional benefit by showing an advert to a single user more than once, causes the expected utility of each future advertising cycle to be dependent on the expected outcome of all the auctions that precede it.",
                "We thus present a stochastic optimisation algorithm based upon simulated annealing that enables the advertising agent to calculate the optimal sequence of bids that maximises its expected utility. 4.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that this advanced bidding strategy outperforms a simple strategy with none of these features (within an heterogenous population the advertising agents who use the advanced bidding strategy are able to expose their adverts to 25% more users than those using the simple bidding strategy), and we show that it performs within 7.5% of that of a centralised optimiser with perfect knowledge of the number of users who will arrival and depart in all future advertising cycles.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses related work where agents and auction-based marketplaces are used to allocated advertising space.",
                "Section 3 describes the prototype BluScreen system that motivates our work.",

                "Feedback is provided through subsequent sales information, allowing the model to build up a profile of a users preferences.",
                "However, unlike the BluScreen Figure 1: A deployed BluScreen prototype. system that we consider here, it is not suitable for advertising to many individuals simultaneously, as it requires explicit interaction with a single user to acquire the users preferences.",
                "By contrast, McCarthy et al. have presented a prototype implementation of a system (GroupCast) that attempts to respond to a group of individuals by assuming a priori profiles of several members of the audience [7].",

                "When several users pass by the display, a centralised system compares the users profiles to identify common areas of interest, and content that matches this common interest is shown.",
                "Thus, whilst CASy is a simulated system that allows advertisers to compete for the attention of single user, GroupCast is a prototype system that detects the presence of groups of users and selects content to match their profiles.",
                "Despite their similarities, neither system addresses the settings that interests us here: how to allocate advertising space between competing advertisers who face an audience of multiple individuals about whom there is no a priori profile information.",

                "Adverts should be presented to as diverse an audience as possible, whilst minimising the number of times the advert is presented to any single user. 2.",

                "Alternatively, in situations where cyclic changes in these rates are likely to occur (i.e. changing arrival and departure rates at different times of the day, as may be seen in areas where commuters pass through), the agent can estimate separate values over each hour long period.",

                "In addition, we expect it to exhibit by an s shaped curve whereby the probability of winning an auction is small when the submitted bid is very low, the probability is close to one when the bid is very high, and there is a transition point that characterises the change from a losing to a wining bid.",
                "To this end, we use the cumulative form of the gamma distribution for this function: P(b) = γ (k, b/θ) Γ (k) (4) where Γ(k) is the standard gamma function, and γ (k, b/θ) is the incomplete gamma function.",

                "In figure 4 we show examples of this function for three different values of k and θ.",
                "The advertising agent chooses the most appropriate values of k and θ by fitting the probability function to observations of previous auctions.",
                "An observation is a pair {bi, oi} consisting of the bid, bi, and an auction outcome, oi.",
                "Each auction generates at least one pair in which bi is equal to the closing price of the auction, and oi = 1.",

                "We define the utility of any advertising cycle as the expected number of users who will see the advert for the first time during that cycle, and hence, we explicitly assume that no additional utility is derived by showing the advert to any user more than once8 .",

                "In the first advertising cycle this is simply determined by the probability of the advertising agent winning the auction, given that it submits a bid b1, and the number of users who are currently in front of the BluScreen display, but have not seen the advert before, is n. Thus, the expected utility of this advertising cycle is simply described by: u1 = P(b1)Nn,0 (6) Now, in the second advertising cycle, the expected utility will clearly depend on the outcome of the auction for the first.",
                "If the first auction was indeed won by the agent, then there will be no users who have yet to see the advert present at the start of the second advertising cycle.",
                "Thus, in this case, the expected number of new users who will see the advert in the second advertising cycle is described by N0,0 (i.e. only newly arriving users will contribute any utility).",
                "By contrast, if the first auction was not won by the agent, then the expected number of users who have yet to see the advert is given by Nn,tc where tc is the length of the preceding adverting cycle (i.e. exactly the case described in section 5.1 where there are n users initially present and the advertising cycle starts at a time tc in the future).",
                "Thus, the expected utility of the second advertising cycle is given by: u2 = P(b2) [P(b1)N0,0 + (1 − P(b1))Nn,tc ] (7) We can generalise this result by noting that the number of users expected to be present within any future advertising cycle will depend on the number of cycles since an auction was last won (since at this point the number of users who are present but have not seen the advert must be equal to zero).",
                "Thus, we must sum over all possible ways in which this can occur, and weight each by its probability.",
                "Hence, the general case for any advertising cycle is described by the rather complex expression: ui = P(bi) i−1 j=1 N0,(i−j−1)tc P(bj) i−1 m=j+1 (1 − P(bm)) + Nn,(i−1)tc i−1 m=1 (1 − P(bm)) (8) Thus, given this expression, the goal of the advertising agent is to calculate the sequence of bids over the c remaining auctions, such that the total expected utility is maximised, whilst ensuring that the remaining budget, B, is not exceeded: arg max b1...bc c i=1 ui such that c i=1 bi = B (9) The Sixth Intl.",

                "However, as the budget increases, the plot passes through a transition whereby the maximum utility occurs at the midpoint of the x-axis, corresponding to bidding equally in both auctions (i.e. b1 = b2 = B/2).",
                "This is simply understood by the fact that continuing to allocate the budget to a single auction results in diminishing returns as the probability of actually winning this auction approaches one.",
                "In this case, the plot is completely symmetrical since the number of users present at the start is equal to its expected value (i.e. n = λa/λd).",
                "If however, n < λa/λd the plot is skewed such that when the budget is small, it should be allocated to the second auction (since more users are expected to arrive before this advertising cycle commences).",

                "Finally, we show that a rational advertising agent, who has a choice of bidding strategy, would always opt to use the advanced bidding strategy over the simple bidding strategy, regardless of the composition of the population that it finds itself in.",
                "Figure 9 shows the average normalised exposure of the advertising agents when the population is composed of different fractions of the two bidding strategies.",
                "In each case, the advanced bidding strategy shows a significant gain in performance compared to the simple bidding strategy (p < 0.0005 in Students t-test), and thus, gains improved exposure over all population compositions. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented an advanced bidding strategy for use by advertising agents within the BluScreen advertising system.",
                "This bidding strategy enabled advertising agents to model and predict the arrival and departure of users, and also to model their success within a first-price sealed bid auction by observing both the bids that they themselves submitted and the winning bid.",
