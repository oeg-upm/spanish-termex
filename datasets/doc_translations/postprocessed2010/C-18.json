Although the main action that the Slammer worm takes is a relatively unsophisticated replication of itself, it still spreads so quickly that human response was ineffective. Most proposed countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms. However, such strategies are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer. In our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be radically different, and potentially such techniques will prove ineffective. Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence. Emergent Intelligence is the behavior of systems, very much like biological systems such as ants or bees, where simple local interactions of autonomous members, with simple primitive actions, gives rise to complex and intelligent global behavior. In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a swarm worm. In addition, we will present preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm. We will show that ZachiK is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.

INTRODUCTION AND PREVIOUSWORK In the early morning hours (05:30 GMT) of January 25, 2003 the fastest computer worm in recorded history began spreading throughout the Internet. Within 10 minutes after the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant disruption to the global Internet infrastructure. Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction. Since Slammer, researchers have explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms. For example, Zou, et al., [2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to detect the early propagation of a worm. Other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the organization to the potential presence of a worm. However, such strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome. That is, systems are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer. In the work described here, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations. Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence. The concept of emergent intelligence was first studied in association with biological systems. In such studies, early researchers discovered a variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild. A flock of birds sweeps across the sky. A group of ants forages for food. A school of fish swims, turns, flees together away from a predator, ands so forth. In general, this kind of aggregate motion has been called swarm behavior. Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and 323 attempted to create models that explain how the elements of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve. Moreover, in recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in transportation systems, in military applications, and other areas, see [3]. The basic concepts that have been developed over the last decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include four basic components. These are: 1. Simplicity of logic & actions: A swarm is composed of N agents whose intelligence is limited. Agents in the swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions. Some models called this primitive actions or behaviors; 2. Local Communication Mechanisms: Agents interact with other members in the swarm via simple local communication mechanisms. For example, a bird in a flock senses the position of adjacent bird and applies a simple rule of avoidance and follow. 3. Distributed control: Autonomous agents interact with their environment, which probably consists of other agents, but act relatively independently from all other agents. There is no central command or leader, and certainly there is no global plan. 4. Emergent Intelligence: Aggregate behavior of autonomous agents results in complex intelligent behaviors; including self-organization. In order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms it is necessary to construct a model that explains the behavior of what we will call generic worms. This model, which extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2. In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more harmful than their similar generic counterparts. Specifically, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms are capable of compromising hosts at rates up to two orders of magnitude faster than their generic counterpart. The rest of this manuscript is structure as follows. In section 2 an abstract model of both generic worms as well as swarm worms is presented. This model is used in section 2.6 to described the first instance of a swarm worm, ZachiK. In section 4, preliminary results via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is presented. Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights into future work are presented. 2. WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance. In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions. By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program. Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things. We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation. We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has. The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target. Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next. Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated. This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment. Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host. In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load. Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions. This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5]. Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories. Here, we further extend their work through parameterization. Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host. Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference. Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space. This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based). Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value). Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split). Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include. Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines. Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data. This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author. The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning. Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle. The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning. Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host. This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination. Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts. Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction. Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies. For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets. Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias. It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same. Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts. Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method. The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at. For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection. This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used. The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes. One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan. Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit. In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent. Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms. In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses. They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system. We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar. We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed. It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way. This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list. The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module. The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks. This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization. It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has. Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern. Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern. Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage. In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized. Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions. In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes. These are: 1. Simplicity of logic & actions; 2. Local Communication Mechanisms; 3. Distributed control; and 4. Emergent Intelligence, including self-organization. 325 Structure Function/Example Infection, Infection Vector Executable is run Protection & Stealthiness Disable McAfee (Staying Alive) Propagation Send email to everyone in address book Goal Based Action (GBA) DDoS www.sco.com Everything else, often called payload Figure 1: General Worm Model In this work we aggregate all of these attributes under the general title of Learning, Communication, and Distributed Control. The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of malware such as Zombies. In figure ??, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions. Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information. On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not. This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise. The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous. Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior. Specifically, • DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN − 99 − 04.html). DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm Attacks due to the large number of agents involved. • Code Red CrV1, Code Red II, Nimbda - Exhibit early notions of swarm attacks, including a backdoor communication channel. • Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1, Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of behavior. For example, they speculate on new worms which employ direct worm-to-worm communication, and employ programmable updates. For example the Warhol worm, and Permutation-Scanning (self coordinating) worms. 2.6 Swarm Worm: the details In considering the creation of what we believed to be the first Swarm Worm in existence, we wanted to adhere as close as possible to the general model presented in section ?? while at the same time facilitating large scale analysis, both empirical and through simulations, of the behavior of the swarm. For this reason, we selected as the first instance Structure Function/Example Infection, Infection Vector Executable is run Protection & Stealthiness Disable McAfee (Staying Alive) Propagation Send email to everyone in address book Learning, Communication, Pheromones/Flags (Test and Distributed Control if Worm is already present) Time bombs, Learning Algorithms, IRC channel Goal Based Action (GBA) DDoS www.sco.com Everything else, often called payload Figure 2: General Model of a Swarm Worm of the swarm a simple password cracking worm. The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords. Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates. In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host. We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators. As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before. In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH. A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random. When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins. After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself. The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors). It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets. It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network. Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study. However, the reader should consider the following: 1. ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors. For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2. ZachiK is a proof of concept worm. The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3. ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space. Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses. However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents. For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small. In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought. In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied. These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above. In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts. However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm. The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists. Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices. Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated. When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages. There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands. The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented. The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs). The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors. The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list. These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible. The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively. The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account). Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address. Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively. In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list. The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals. These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed. The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers. The simulator was written in C++ . The simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors. In the case of a simple local area network of 30 computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected. At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero. All shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes. Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets. For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts. In such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets. The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 4. RESULTS In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented. In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords. The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms. The class of worms presented are as follows: • I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); • S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and • S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings. As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms. In this set of experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm. Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart. In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed. These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment. Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds. Note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password space. In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are presented. In this set of simulation runs, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets. The data presented reflects the behaviors of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies (random scanning and local bias). The amount of local bias was varied across multiple simulation runs. The results presented are aggregate behaviors. In general the following class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated. Address Scanning: • Random:= addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space; and • Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space. The percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs. Learning, Communication & Distributed Control • I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/ memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); • I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/ memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information with offsprings only (OOS); • S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; • S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP); • S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings. As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with our set of empirical results. In addition, the following observations can be made. 1. Local preference is incredibly effective. 2. Short address handoffs are more effective than long ones. We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3. For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm. In this case, we can think of the swarm as launching a distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use different passwords to try to break into susceptible uninfected host. In the local bias mode, early in the life of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered. Then the targeting of local addresses assists in discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and 4. Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time in non-local bias mode. Basically, the shared password list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm reverts to simply a random discovery of password algorithm.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this manuscript, we have presented an abstract model, similar in some aspects to that of Weaver [5], that helps explain the generic nature of worms. The model presented in section 2 was extended to incorporate a new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more harmful than their generic counterparts. In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms is capable of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth capabilities. This work opens up a new area of interesting problems. Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be consider are as follows: • Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way that true emergent behavior takes place? • Are the current techniques being developed in the design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new class of worms?; and • What techniques, if any, can be developed to create defenses against swarm worms? 6.

Aunque la acción principal que toma el gusano del slammer es una replicación relativamente poco sofisticada de sí misma, todavía se propaga tan rápido que la respuesta humana era ineficaz. La mayoría de las estrategias de contramedidas propuestas se basan principalmente en la detección de tasas y los algoritmos limitantes. Sin embargo, tales estrategias están siendo diseñadas y desarrolladas para contener eficazmente gusanos cuyos comportamientos son similares a los de Slammer. En nuestro trabajo, presentamos la hipótesis de que los gusanos de próxima generación serán radicalmente diferentes, y potencialmente tales técnicas resultarán ineficaces. Específicamente, proponemos estudiar una nueva generación de gusanos llamados gusanos de enjambre, cuyo comportamiento se basa en el concepto de inteligencia emergente. La inteligencia emergente es el comportamiento de los sistemas, muy parecidos a los sistemas biológicos como las hormigas o las abejas, donde las interacciones locales simples de los miembros autónomos, con acciones primitivas simples, da lugar al comportamiento global complejo e inteligente. En este manuscrito introduciremos los principios básicos detrás de la idea de los gusanos de enjambre, así como la estructura básica requerida para ser considerado un gusano de enjambre. Además, presentaremos resultados preliminares sobre las velocidades de propagación de uno de esos gusanos de enjambre, llamado gusano zachik. Mostraremos que Zachik es capaz de propagarse a una velocidad 2 órdenes de magnitud más rápido que los gusanos similares sin capacidades de enjambre.

Introducción y trabajo previo en las primeras horas de la mañana (05:30 GMT) del 25 de enero de 2003 El gusano informático más rápido en la historia registrada comenzó a difundirse por Internet. Dentro de los 10 minutos posteriores al primer huésped infectado (paciente cero), el 90 por ciento de todos los huéspedes vulnerables se habían visto comprometidos creando una interrupción significativa en la infraestructura global de Internet. Vern Paxson, del Instituto Internacional de Ciencias de la Computación y el Laboratorio Nacional de Lawrence Berkeley, en su análisis de Slammer, comentó: El gusano Slammer se extendió tan rápido que la respuesta humana fue ineficaz, ver [4] la parte interesante, desde nuestra perspectiva, sobre la propagación de Slammer ISque era un gusano relativamente poco sofisticado con comportamiento benigno, a saber, la auto-reproducción. Desde Slammer, los investigadores han explorado los comportamientos de los gusanos de propagación rápida y han diseñado estrategias de contramedidas basadas principalmente en la detección de tarifas y los algoritmos limitantes. Por ejemplo, Zou, et al., [2], propuso un esquema donde se usa un filtro Kalman para detectar la propagación temprana de un gusano. Otros investigadores han propuesto el uso de detectores donde las tasas de mensajes inalcanzables de destino son monitoreadas por firewalls, y un aumento significativo más allá de lo normal, alerta a la organización sobre la presencia potencial de un gusano. Sin embargo, tales estrategias sufren del síndrome de la última guerra. Es decir, los sistemas están siendo diseñados y desarrollados para contener efectivamente gusanos cuyos comportamientos son similares a los de Slammer. En el trabajo descrito aquí, presentamos la hipótesis de que los gusanos de próxima generación serán diferentes y, por lo tanto, tales técnicas pueden tener algunas limitaciones significativas. Específicamente, proponemos estudiar una nueva generación de gusanos llamados gusanos de enjambre, cuyo comportamiento se basa en el concepto de inteligencia emergente. El concepto de inteligencia emergente se estudió por primera vez en asociación con sistemas biológicos. En tales estudios, los primeros investigadores descubrieron una variedad de interesantes comportamientos de insectos o animales en la naturaleza. Una bandada de pájaros atraviesa el cielo. Un grupo de forrajes de hormigas para alimentos. Una escuela de peces nadan, giros, pulgas juntas de un depredador, etc. En general, este tipo de movimiento agregado se ha llamado comportamiento del enjambre. Los biólogos y los informáticos en el campo de la inteligencia artificial han estudiado tales enjambres biológicos, y 323 intentaron crear modelos que expliquen cómo los elementos de un enjambre interactúan, logran objetivos y evolucionan. Además, en los últimos años, el estudio de la inteligencia del enjambre se ha vuelto cada vez más importante en los campos de la robótica, el diseño de redes ad-hoc móviles (Manets), el diseño de sistemas de detección de intrusos, el estudio de los patrones de tráfico en los sistemas de transporte, en militares, en militaresAplicaciones y otras áreas, ver [3]. Los conceptos básicos que se han desarrollado en la última década para explicar los enjambres, y el comportamiento del enjambre incluyen cuatro componentes básicos. Estos son: 1. Simplicidad de la lógica y las acciones: un enjambre está compuesto por n agentes cuya inteligencia es limitada. Los agentes en el enjambre utilizan reglas locales simples para gobernar sus acciones. Algunos modelos llamaron a estas acciones o comportamientos primitivos;2. Mecanismos de comunicación local: los agentes interactúan con otros miembros en el enjambre a través de simples mecanismos de comunicación local. Por ejemplo, un pájaro en un rebaño detecta la posición del ave adyacente y aplica una regla simple de evitar y seguir.3. Control distribuido: los agentes autónomos interactúan con su entorno, que probablemente consiste en otros agentes, pero actúan de manera relativamente independiente de todos los demás agentes. No existe un comando o líder central, y ciertamente no hay un plan global.4. Inteligencia emergente: el comportamiento agregado de los agentes autónomos da como resultado comportamientos inteligentes complejos;incluyendo autoorganización. Para comprender completamente el comportamiento de tales enjambres, es necesario construir un modelo que explique el comportamiento de lo que llamaremos gusanos genéricos. Este modelo, que extiende el trabajo de Weaver [5], se presenta aquí en la Sección 2. Además, tenemos la intención de extender dicho modelo de tal manera que explica claramente los comportamientos de esta nueva clase de gusanos potencialmente peligrosos llamados gusanos de enjambre. Los gusanos de enjambre se comportan mucho como enjambres biológicos y exhiben un alto grado de aprendizaje, comunicación e inteligencia distribuida. Tales gusanos enjambres son potencialmente más dañinos que sus contrapartes genéricas similares. Específicamente, se creó la primera instancia, hasta donde sabemos, se creó un gusano de aprendizaje, llamado Zachik. Zachik es un gusano de enjambre de crujido de contraseña simple que incorpora diferentes estrategias de aprendizaje e intercambio de información. Tal gusano de enjambre se implementó tanto en una red de área local de treinta (30) hosts, así como se simuló en una topología de 10,000 nodos. Los resultados preliminares mostraron que tales gusanos son capaces de comprometer los huéspedes a velocidades de hasta dos órdenes de magnitud más rápido que su contraparte genérica. El resto de este manuscrito es la estructura de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 se presenta un modelo abstracto de gusanos genéricos como de gusanos enjambres. Este modelo se usa en la Sección 2.6 para describir la primera instancia de un gusano enjambre, Zachik. En la Sección 4, se presentan resultados preliminares a través de mediciones empíricas y simulación. Finalmente, en la Sección 5 se presentan nuestras conclusiones e ideas sobre el trabajo futuro.2. Modelado de gusanos Para estudiar el comportamiento de los gusanos de enjambre En general, es necesario crear un modelo que refleje de manera realista la estructura de los gusanos y no necesariamente está vinculado a una instancia específica. En esta sección, describimos dicho modelo donde se describe que un gusano general tiene cuatro (4) componentes o subfunciones básicas. Por definición, un gusano es un programa autocontinido y autoproductivo. Por lo tanto, en términos simples, tiene dos funciones principales: lo que se propaga y lo que hace otras cosas. Proponemos que hay una tercera funcionalidad amplia de un gusano, la de la autoconservación. También proponemos que la otra funcionalidad de un gusano puede clasificarse más apropiadamente como acciones basadas en objetivos (GBA), ya que cualquier funcionalidad incluida en un gusano dependerá naturalmente de cualquier objetivo (y subggoals) que tenga el autor. El trabajo presentado por Weaver et.Alabama.En [5] nos proporciona principalmente una taxonomía basada en la acción y la técnica de los gusanos informáticos, que utilizamos y extendemos aún más aquí.2.1 Propagación La función de propagación en sí misma puede descomponerse en tres acciones: adquirir el objetivo, enviar escaneo e infectar el objetivo. Adquirir el objetivo simplemente significa elegir un anfitrión para atacar a continuación. Enviar un escaneo implica verificar si ese host es receptivo a un intento de infección, ya que el espacio de IP está escasamente poblado. Esto puede implicar un ping simple para verificar si el host está vivo o una evaluación de vulnerabilidad completa. Infectar el objetivo es el método real utilizado para enviar el código de gusano al nuevo host. En el formulario de algoritmo: propagate () {host: = adquire_target () éxito: = send_scan (host) if (éxito) luego infectar (host) endif} en el caso de un gusano simple que no verifica si el host es esDisponible o susceptible (como Slammer), el método de escaneo se elimina: propagate () {host: = adquire_target () infect (host)} Cada una de estas acciones puede tener un costo asociado para su inclusión y ejecución, como el mayor tamaño del gusanoy CPU o carga de red. Dependiendo de las necesidades o requisitos de los autores, estos se convierten en factores limitantes en lo que se puede incluir en las acciones de Worms. Esto se discute más a fondo después de expandir estas acciones a continuación.2.2 Adquisición de objetivos: la fase de adquisición objetivo de nuestro algoritmo de gusano se construye directamente a partir de la sección de descubrimiento de objetivos en [5]. Weaver et.Alabama.Taxonomizar esta tarea en 5 categorías separadas. Aquí, ampliamos aún más su trabajo a través de la parametrización. Escaneo: el escaneo puede considerarse un método basado en la ecuación para elegir un host. Se puede usar cualquier tipo de ecuación para llegar a una dirección IP, pero hasta ahora hay tres tipos principales: preferencia secuencial, aleatoria y local. El escaneo secuencial es exactamente como suena: comience en una dirección IP e incrementando a través de todo el espacio IP. Esto podría llevar consigo las opciones de las cuales IP para comenzar (valor elegido por el usuario, aleatorio o basado en IP de host infectado) y 324 cuántas veces se incrementan (valor continuo, elegido o basado en subred). El escaneo aleatorio está completamente al azar (dependiendo del método PRNG elegido y su valor de semilla). El escaneo de preferencias locales es una varianza de secuencial o aleatorio, por lo que tiene una mayor probabilidad de elegir una dirección IP local sobre una remota (por ejemplo, la división tradicional 80/20). Listas de objetivos previamente generados: las listas de objetivos previamente generadas, o las llamadas listas de golpes, podrían incluir las opciones para el porcentaje de población total y porcentaje incorrecto, o simplemente el número de IP para incluir. Implícito para este tipo está el hecho de que la lista se divide entre un padre y sus hijos, evitando el problema de cada instancia que alcanza exactamente las mismas máquinas. Listas de destino generadas externamente: las listas de objetivos generadas externamente dependen de una o más fuentes externas que se puedan consultar para los datos del host. Esto involucrará a los servidores que normalmente están disponibles públicamente, como los meta-servidores de juegos o los que el autor o el autor de gusano o de gusano lo configuran explícitamente. Los meta-servidores normalmente disponibles podrían tener parámetros para las tasas de cambio, como muchos aparecen por la noche o que se van por la mañana. Cada servidor también podría tener consultas máximas/segundo que podría manejar. El gusano también necesitaría una forma de encontrar estos servidores, ya sea dura o mediante escaneo. Listas de objetivos internos: las listas de objetivos internos dependen en gran medida del host infectado. Este método podría parametrizar la elección de cuánta información está en el host, como todas las máquinas en la subred, todas las cajas de Windows en la subred, servidores particulares, número de interno/externo, o alguna combinación. Pasivo: los métodos pasivos están determinados por interacciones normales entre hosts. Los parámetros pueden incluir una tasa de interacción con máquinas particulares, tasa de interacción interna/externa o tasa de interacción basada en subred. Cualquiera de estos métodos también se puede combinar para producir diferentes tipos de estrategias de adquisición de objetivos. Por ejemplo, el gusano A puede comenzar con una lista de golpes inicial de 100 hosts o subredes diferentes. Una vez que ha agotado su búsqueda usando la lista de golpes, puede proceder a realizar escaneo aleatorio con un sesgo local del 50%. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que el consumo de recursos de cada método no es el mismo. Los diferentes métodos pueden requerir que el gusano sea grande, como los bytes adicionales requeridos por una lista de golpes, o que tomen más tiempo de procesamiento, como buscar en el host direcciones de otros hosts vulnerables. Se deben realizar más investigaciones y análisis en esta área para determinar los costos asociados para usar cada método. Los costos podrían usarse para determinar las compensaciones de diseño en las que participan los autores de gusanos. Por ejemplo, las listas de HIT proporcionan una alta tasa de infección, pero a un alto costo del tamaño de la carga útil de gusanos.2.2.1 Enviar un escaneo Las pruebas de la función de escaneo de envío para ver si el host está disponible para infección. Esto puede ser tan simple como verificar si el host está en la red o tan complejo como verificación si el host es vulnerable a la exploit que se utilizará. El envío de un escaneo antes del intento de infección puede aumentar la tasa de escaneo si el costo por fallar una infección es mayor que el costo de fallar un escaneo o enviar un escaneo más infección;y las fallas son más frecuentes que los éxitos. Un parámetro importante para esto sería la elección del protocolo de transporte (TCP/UDP) o simplemente el tiempo para un escaneo exitoso y el tiempo para un escaneo fallido. Además, ya sea que pruebe o no para que el host esté activo o si se trata de una prueba completa para la vulnerabilidad (o para múltiples vulnerabilidades).2.2.2 Vector de infección (iv) El vector de infección particular utilizado para acceder al host remoto depende principalmente de la vulnerabilidad particular elegida para explotar. En un sentido no específico, depende del protocolo de transporte elegido para usar y del tamaño del mensaje que se enviará. La Sección 3 de [5] también propone tres clases particulares de IV: autocrutado, segundo canal e incrustado.2.3 Auto preservación Las acciones de auto -preservación de un gusano pueden tomar muchas formas. En la naturaleza, se ha observado que los gusanos deshabilitan el software antivirus o evitan que se envíe a ciertas direcciones antivirus conocidas. También se ha visto que intentan deshabilitar otros gusanos que pueden estar luchando por el mismo sistema. También creemos que un escaneo acelerado basado en el tiempo puede ayudar al gusano a deslizarse bajo el radar. También proponemos un método de señuelo, por el cual un gusano liberará a algunos niños que causan mucho ruido para que el padre no se note. También se ha propuesto [5] que un gusano causa daño a su huésped si, y solo si, se altera de alguna manera. Este módulo podría contener parámetros para: probabilidad de éxito en deshabilitar el antivirus u otras actualizaciones de software, la probabilidad de ser notado y, por lo tanto, eliminado, o endurecimiento del host contra otros gusanos.2.4 Acciones basadas en objetivos Una funcionalidad GBA de Worms depende de la lista de objetivos de los autores. La sección de cargas útiles de [5] proporciona algunas sugerencias útiles para dicho módulo. La apertura de una puerta trasera puede hacer que el anfitrión sea susceptible a más ataques. Esto implicaría una probabilidad de que se utilice la puerta trasera y cualquier utilización del tráfico asociada. También podría proporcionar una lista de otros gusanos que este anfitrión ahora es susceptible o una lista de vulnerabilidades que ahora tiene este host. Los relés de spam y los proxis HTTP, por supuesto, tienen un consumo de ancho de banda asociado o un patrón de tráfico. Los ataques de DOS de Internet tendrían un tiempo establecido de activación, un objetivo y un patrón de tráfico. El daño de los datos tendría una probabilidad asociada de que el host muera debido al daño. En la Figura 1, se resume este modelo general de un gusano. Tenga en cuenta que en este modelo no hay aprendizaje, ni muy poco, compartir información entre instancias de gusanos, y ciertamente no hay coordinación de acciones. En la siguiente sección expandimos el modelo para incluir tales mecanismos y, por lo tanto, llegamos al modelo general de un gusano enjambres.2.5 Swarms: modelo general como se describe en la Sección 1, las características básicas que distinguieron el comportamiento del enjambre de lo que parece ser comportamientos coordinados colectivos son cuatro atributos básicos. Estos son: 1. Simplicidad de lógica y acciones;2. Mecanismos de comunicación local;3. Control distribuido;y 4. Inteligencia emergente, incluida la autoorganización.325 FUNCIÓN DE ESTRUCTURA/Ejemplo Infección, Infection Vector Ejecutable es Protección de ejecución y sigiloso Deshabilitar McAfee (permanecer vivo) Enviar correo electrónico a todos en la acción de la libreta de direcciones Acción basada en objetivos (GBA) ddos www.sco.com Todo lo demás, a menudo llamado carga útil Figura 1:Modelo de gusano general En este trabajo agregamos todos estos atributos bajo el título general de aprendizaje, comunicación y control distribuido. La presencia de estos atributos distingue gusanos de enjambre de gusanos regulares u otros tipos de malware, como los zombis. En figura ??, El modelo genérico de un gusano se expande para incluir este conjunto de acciones. En este contexto, entonces, un gusano como Slammer no puede clasificarse como un gusano enjambre debido al hecho de que las nuevas instancias del gusano no coordinan sus acciones o comparten información. Por otro lado, los zombis y muchas otras formas de DDoS, que a primera vista pueden considerar los gusanos de enjambre no lo son. Esto se debe simplemente al hecho de que en el caso de los zombis, el control no está distribuido sino más bien centralizado, y no surgen comportamientos emergentes. Este último, la aparición potencial de inteligencia o nuevos comportamientos es lo que hace que los gusanos enjambres sean tan potencialmente peligrosos. Finalmente, cuando se considera la mayoría de las interrupciones recientes a la infraestructura de Internet, y a la luz de nuestra descripción de los ataques de enjambre, las interrupciones pueden clasificarse fácilmente como precursores para un comportamiento verdaderamente enjambre. Específicamente, • DDoS: una gran cantidad de hosts comprometidos envían paquetes inútiles que requieren procesamiento (Stacheldraht, http: //www.cert.org/ incidentNotes/in - 99 - 04.html). Los ataques DDoS son los primeros precursores de los ataques de enjambre debido a la gran cantidad de agentes involucrados.• Code Red CRV1, Code Red II, NIMBDA: exhiben nociones tempranas de ataques de enjambre, incluido un canal de comunicación de puerta trasera.• Staniford y Paxson en ¿Cómo ser dueño de Internet en su tiempo libre?Explore las modificaciones a CRV1, Code Red I, II con un tipo de comportamiento como enjambre. Por ejemplo, especulan en nuevos gusanos que emplean la comunicación directa de gusanos a gusanos y emplean actualizaciones programables. Por ejemplo, el gusano Warhol y los gusanos de escaneo de permutación (auto coordinación).2.6 Gusano de enjambre: Los detalles al considerar la creación de lo que creíamos que era el primer gusano enjambre que existía, ¿queríamos adherirnos lo más cerca posible del modelo general presentado en la sección??mientras que al mismo tiempo facilita el análisis a gran escala, tanto empírico como a través de simulaciones, del comportamiento del enjambre. Por esta razón, seleccionamos como la función de estructura de primera instancia/ejemplo de infección, la infección por vectores de infección es la protección de ejecución y el sigilo Deshabilitar la propagación de McAfee (permanecer vivo) Enviar correo electrónico a todos en el aprendizaje de la libreta de direcciones, comunicación, feromonas/banderas (control y control distribuidoSi el gusano ya está presente) bombas de tiempo, algoritmos de aprendizaje, acción de objetivos basado en objetivos del canal IRC (GBA) DDOS www.sco.com Todo lo demás, a menudo llamado carga útil Figura 2: Modelo general de un gusano enjambre del enjambre Un gusano de agrietamiento de contraseña simple. El objetivo de este gusano simplemente es infectar un host intentando inicialmente iniciar sesión en el host utilizando contraseñas conocidas (ataque de diccionario), contraseñas que cualquier miembro del Swarm y contraseñas aleatorias han descubierto previamente. Una vez que un host está infectado, el gusano creará canales de comunicación con sus vecinos conocidos en ese momento, así como con cualquier descripción que genera con éxito. En este contexto, una generación exitosa de una descendencia significa simplemente infectar un nuevo host y replicar una copia exacta de sí misma en dicho host. Llamamos a este gusano del enjambre el gusano zachik en honor a uno de sus creadores. Como se puede ver en esta descripción, el gusano Zachik exhibe todos los elementos descritos antes. En las siguientes secciones, describimos en detalle cada uno de los elementos del gusano Zachik.2.7 Vector de infección El vector de infección utilizado para el gusano Zachik es el Protocolo de concha seguro SSH. Se escribió un cliente modificado que es capaz de recibir contraseñas de la línea de comandos e integrado con un script que lo proporciona varias contraseñas: conocido y aleatorio. Cuando se encuentra una contraseña para un objetivo apropiado, comienza el proceso de infección. Después de descubrir la contraseña de root de un host, el gusano infecta el host de destino y se replica. El gusano crea un nuevo directorio en el host de destino, copia el cliente SSH modificado, el script, los servidores de comunicaciones y las versiones actualizadas de los archivos de datos (lista de contraseñas conocidas y una lista de vecinos actuales). Luego ejecuta el script modificado en los hosts recién infectados, que generan el servidor de comunicaciones, notifica a los vecinos y comienza a buscar nuevos objetivos. Se podría argumentar, correctamente, que el gusano Zachik puede ser fácilmente derrotado por las técnicas actuales de contramedidas presentes en la mayoría de los sistemas hoy en día, como no permitir los inicios de raíz directa de la red. Dentro de este contexto, Zachik puede descartarse rápidamente como un gusano muy simple e inofensivo que no requiere más estudio. Sin embargo, el lector debe considerar lo siguiente: 1. Zachik se puede modificar fácilmente para incluir una variedad de vectores de infección. Por ejemplo, podría programarse para adivinar los nombres de usuario comunes y sus contraseñas;Obtenga 326 acceso a un sistema, luego adivine la contraseña de root o use otras vulnerabilidades bien conocidas para obtener privilegios raíz;2. Zachik es una prueba de gusano conceptual. La importancia de Zachik es que incorpora todos los comportamientos de un gusano enjambres, incluidos, pero no restringidos, control distribuido, comunicación entre agentes y aprendizaje;3. Zachik está compuesto por una gran colección de agentes que operan independientemente que se presta naturalmente a algoritmos paralelos, como una búsqueda paralela del espacio de direcciones IPv4. Dentro de este contexto, Slammer, incorpora una capacidad de búsqueda paralela de direcciones potencialmente susceptibles. Sin embargo, a diferencia de Zachik, el conocimiento descubierto por la búsqueda nunca se comparte entre los agentes. Por estas razones, y muchas otras, uno no debería descartar el potencial de esta nueva clase de gusanos, sino adoptar su estudio.2.8 Auto-conservación En el caso del gusano Zachik, las principales técnicas de autoconservación utilizadas simplemente mantienen la carga útil pequeña. En este contexto, esto simplemente significa restringir el número de contraseñas que una descendencia hereda, disfrazando los mensajes de gusano como solicitudes HTTP comunes y restringir el número de vecinos a un máximo de cinco (5).2.9 Propagación Elección del siguiente objetivo (s) en un asunto eficiente requiere pensamiento. En el pasado, los gusanos conocidos y propuestos, ver [5], han aplicado técnicas de propagación que variaron. Estos incluyen: selección estrictamente aleatoria de un host vulnerable potencial;listas de objetivos de hosts vulnerables;selección aleatoria sesgada localmente (seleccione un objetivo de host al azar de una subred local);y una combinación de algunas o todas las anteriores. En nuestros entornos de prueba y simulación, aplicaremos una combinación de selección localmente sesgada y totalmente aleatoria de posibles hosts vulnerables. Sin embargo, debido al hecho de que el gusano Zachik es un gusano enjambre, el descubrimiento de direcciones (es decir, cuando se descubren direcciones inexistentes) se compartirá la información entre los miembros del enjambre. Los subprocesos de infección y propagación realizan el siguiente conjunto de actividades repetidamente: • Elija una dirección • Verifique la validez de la dirección • Elija un conjunto de contraseñas • Intente infectar el host seleccionado con este conjunto de contraseñas como se describe anteriormente, elegir una dirección hace usode una combinación de selección aleatoria, sesgo local y listas de objetivos. Específicamente, para elegir una dirección, la instancia puede: • Generar una nueva dirección aleatoria • Generar una dirección en la red local • Elija una dirección de una lista de transferencia.Dependencia de la propagación de elecciones particulares. La contraseña se elige de la lista de contraseñas conocidas o recién generadas. Cuando falla una infección de una dirección válida, se agrega a una lista de transferencias, que se envía a los vecinos para tratar de trabajar.2.10 Aprendizaje, Comunicación y distribuida Control 2.10.1 Comunicación El concepto de un enjambre se basa en la transferencia de información entre los vecinos, que transmiten sus nuevos mensajes entrantes a sus vecinos, y así sucesivamente hasta que cada instancia de gusano en el enjambre sea consciente de estos mensajes. Hay dos clases de mensajes: datos o mensajes de información y comandos. Los mensajes de comando están destinados a un usuario externo (también conocido como hackers y/o galletas salientes) para controlar las acciones de las instancias, y actualmente no se implementan. Los mensajes de información son actualmente de tres tipos: nuevo miembro, contraseñas y direcciones explotables (transferencias). Los nuevos mensajes de los miembros son mensajes que una nueva instancia envía a los vecinos en su lista (corta) de vecinos iniciales. Los vecinos luego registran estas instancias en su lista de vecinos. Estos son mensajes que forman la múltiple conexión del enjambre, y sin ellos, la topología será una estructura de alojamiento, donde eliminar un solo nodo causaría que las instancias debajo de él sean inaccesibles. Los mensajes de contraseñas informan instancias de contraseñas recién descubiertas, e informando todas las instancias, el enjambre como total recopila esta información, lo que le permite infectar nuevas instancias de manera más efectiva. Los mensajes de transferencia informan instancias de direcciones válidas que no podrían verse comprometidas (falle en romper la contraseña para la cuenta raíz). Dado que el espacio de direcciones es bastante escaso, lleva un tiempo relativamente largo (es decir, muchas pruebas) para descubrir una dirección válida. Por lo tanto, al entregar direcciones válidas descubiertas, el enjambre (a) conserva la energía al no volver a descubrir las mismas direcciones (b) atacar de manera más efectiva. En cierto modo, esta es una instancia simple de actividad coordinada de un enjambre.2.10.2 Coordinación Cuando nace una instancia de gusano, transmite su existencia a todos los vecinos en su lista. El hilo principal luego genera algunos hilos de infección y continúa manejando los mensajes entrantes (registrando vecinos, agregando nuevas contraseñas, recibiendo direcciones y transmitiendo estos mensajes).2.10.3 Control distribuido El control en el gusano Zachik se distribuye en el sentido de que cada instancia del gusano realiza un conjunto de acciones independientemente de cualquier otra instancia y, al mismo tiempo, se beneficia del aprendizaje alcanzado por sus vecinos inmediatos.2.11 Acciones basadas en objetivos La primera instanciación del gusano Zachik tiene dos objetivos básicos. Estos son: (1) propagarse y (2) descubrir y compartir con los miembros de las nuevas contraseñas de root en el enjambre.3. Diseño experimental Para verificar nuestra hipótesis de que los gusanos de enjambre son más capaces y, por lo tanto, peligrosos que otros 327 gusanos conocidos, se creó una prueba de red y se creó un simulador, capaz de simular topologías similares a Internet (espacio IPv4),desarrollado. La red de redes consistió en una red de área local de 30 computadoras basadas en Linux. El simulador fue escrito en C ++. El simple gusano de enjambre descrito en la Sección 2.6 se usó para infectar al paciente-cero, y luego se permitió que el gusano enjambre se propagara a través de sus propios mecanismos de propagación, control distribuido y comportamientos de enjambre. En el caso de una red de área local simple de 30 computadoras, se seleccionaron seis (6) contraseñas de raíz diferentes de un espacio de contraseña de 4 dígitos (10000 opciones). Al comienzo del experimento, se conoce una única contraseña conocida, la del paciente-cero. Todas las contraseñas compartidas se distribuyen al azar en todos los nodos. Del mismo modo, en el caso de la simulación, se construyó una topología de red de 10,000 hosts, cuyas direcciones se seleccionaron aleatoriamente a través del espacio IPv4. Dentro de ese espacio, se seleccionaron y se distribuyeron un total de 200 contraseñas compartidas y se distribuyeron al azar y/o dirigidas a subredes de topologías de red específicas. Por ejemplo, en una de nuestras ejecuciones de simulación, la topología de la red consistió en 200 subredes cada una que contenía 50 hosts. En tal topología, las contraseñas compartidas se distribuyeron en subredes donde se compartió un porcentaje variable de contraseñas en las subredes. Los porcentajes de contraseñas compartidas utilizadas reflejaron los primeros estudios empíricos, donde se descubrió que hasta el 39.7% de las contraseñas comunes se compartían.4. Resultados en la Figura 3, se presentan los resultados que comparan el comportamiento de ataque de enjambre versus el de un gusano malformado típico para una LAN de 30 nodos. En este conjunto de ejecuciones empíricas, seis (6) contraseñas compartidas se distribuyeron al azar en todos los nodos de una posible de 10,000 contraseñas desconocidas. Los datos presentados reflejan los comportamientos de un total de tres (3) clases distintas de gusanos o gusanos de enjambre. La clase de gusanos presentados son las siguientes: • I-NS-NL: = Generic Worm, Independent (I), sin aprendizaje/Memoria (NL) y sin compartir información con vecinos o descendientes (NS);• S-L-S-SP: = gusano Swarm (s), aprendizaje (L), mantiene la lista de contraseñas aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseñas (SP) en los vecinos y descendientes más cercanos;y • S-L-SP&A: = WeMm Worm (s), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseñas aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseñas y direcciones existentes (SP&A) en los vecinos y descendientes más cercanos. Como se muestra en la Figura 3, los resultados validan nuestra hipótesis original de que los gusanos enjambres son significativamente más eficientes y peligrosos que los gusanos genéricos. En este conjunto de experimentos, el intercambio de contraseñas proporciona un orden de mejora de magnitud sobre un gusano aleatorio sin memoria. Del mismo modo, un gusano enjambre que comparte contraseñas y direcciones es aproximadamente dos órdenes de magnitud más eficiente que su contraparte genérica. En la Figura 3, se puede observar una serie de discontinuidades. Estas discontinuidades son un artefacto del pequeño espacio de muestra utilizado para este experimento. Básicamente, tan pronto como se rompe una contraseña, todos los nodos que comparten esa contraseña específica se infectan en unos pocos segundos. Tenga en cuenta que es trivial que un gusano enjambre escanee y descubra un pequeño espacio de contraseña compartida. En la Figura 4, se presentan los resultados de la simulación que comparan el comportamiento del ataque del enjambre versus el de un gusano malformado genérico. En este conjunto de ejecuciones de simulación, se construyó una topología de red de 10,000 hosts, cuyas direcciones se seleccionaron aleatoriamente a través del espacio IPv4. Dentro de ese espacio, se seleccionaron y se distribuyeron un total de 200 contraseñas compartidas y se distribuyeron al azar y/o dirigidas a subredes de topologías de red específicas. Los datos presentados reflejan los comportamientos de tres (3) clases distintas de gusanos de gusanos o enjambres y dos (2) estrategias de escaneo de selección de host objetivo diferente (escaneo aleatorio y sesgo local). La cantidad de sesgo local se varió en múltiples ejecuciones de simulación. Los resultados presentados son comportamientos agregados. En general, se simularon la siguiente clase de gusanos genéricos y gusanos de enjambre. Escaneo de direcciones: • aleatorias: = Las direcciones se seleccionan al azar desde un subconjunto del espacio IPv4, a saber, un espacio de direcciones 224;y • Sesgo local: = Las direcciones se seleccionan al azar desde una subred local (256 direcciones) o desde un subconjunto del espacio IPv4, a saber, un espacio de direcciones 224. El porcentaje de sesgo local varía en múltiples ejecuciones. Aprendizaje, comunicación y control distribuido • I-NL-NS: gusano genérico, independiente (i), sin aprendizaje/ memoria (NL) y sin compartir información con vecinos o descendientes (NS);• I-L-OO: gusano genérico, independiente (i), aprendizaje/ sin memoria (l) y una vez compartiendo información con descuentos solo (OOS);• S-L-S-SP: = gusano Swarm (s), aprendizaje (L), mantiene la lista de contraseñas aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseñas (SP) en los vecinos y descendientes más cercanos;• S-L-S & AOP: = Swarm Worm (s), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseñas aprendidas y el intercambio de direcciones con vecinos y descendientes, comparte contraseñas solo una vez (en la creación) con descendientes (SA & OP);• S-L-SP & A: = Swarm Worm (S), Learning (L), mantiene la lista de contraseñas aprendidas y el intercambio de contraseñas y direcciones existentes (SP&A) en los vecinos y descendientes más cercanos. Como se muestra en la Figura 4, los resultados son consistentes con nuestro conjunto de resultados empíricos. Además, se pueden hacer las siguientes observaciones.1. La preferencia local es increíblemente efectiva.2. Las transferencias de direcciones cortas son más efectivas que las largas. Variamos el tamaño de la lista permitida en el intercambio de direcciones;La sobrecarga asociada con una larga lista de direcciones es perjudicial para el rendimiento del gusano del enjambre, así como para su sigilo;3. Para el caso de sesgo local, compartir direcciones válidas de anfitrión susceptible, S-L-S & AOP Worm (retiro, el S-S-S & AOP Swarm que comparte contraseñas, una sola vez, con Offsprings 328 en el momento de la creación) es más efectivo que compartir contraseñas en caso de queSwarm de S-L-S-SP. En este caso, podemos pensar en el enjambre como lanzar un ataque DistributedDictionary: diferentes segmentos del enjambre usan diferentes contraseñas para tratar de entrar en el host no infectado susceptible. En el modo de sesgo local, al principio de la vida del enjambre, el intercambio de direcciones es más efectivo que el intercambio de contraseñas, hasta que se descubren la mayoría de las subredes. Luego, la orientación de las direcciones locales ayuda a descubrir los hosts susceptibles, mientras que los miembros del enjambre deben perder el tiempo redescubriendo las contraseñas;y 4. Infectar el último 0.5% de los nodos lleva mucho tiempo en modo de sesgo no local. Básicamente, la lista de contraseñas compartidas en las subredes se ha agotado, y el enjambre vuelve a un descubrimiento aleatorio del algoritmo de contraseña.

Resumen y trabajo futuro En este manuscrito, hemos presentado un modelo abstracto, similar en algunos aspectos al de Weaver [5], que ayuda a explicar la naturaleza genérica de los gusanos. El modelo presentado en la Sección 2 se extendió para incorporar una nueva clase de gusanos potencialmente peligrosos llamados gusanos de enjambre. Los gusanos de enjambre se comportan mucho como enjambres biológicos y exhiben un alto grado de aprendizaje, comunicación e inteligencia distribuida. Tales gusanos enjambres son potencialmente más dañinos que sus contrapartes genéricas. Además, se creó la primera instancia, hasta donde sabemos, de este gusano de aprendizaje, llamado Zachik. Zachik es un gusano de enjambre de crujido de contraseña simple que incorpora diferentes estrategias de aprendizaje e intercambio de información. Tal gusano de enjambre se implementó tanto en una red de área local de treinta (30) hosts, así como se simuló en una topología de 10,000 nodos. Los resultados preliminares mostraron que tales gusanos son capaces de comprometer los hosts a tasas de hasta 2 órdenes de magnitud más rápido que su contraparte genérica mientras retiene las capacidades de sigilo. Este trabajo abre una nueva área de problemas interesantes. Algunos de los problemas más interesantes y apremiantes a considerar son los siguientes: • ¿Es posible aplicar algunos de los conceptos de aprendizaje desarrollados en los últimos diez años en las áreas de inteligencia de enjambre, sistemas de agentes y control distribuido al diseño de enjambres sofisticados¿Los gusanos de tal manera que tiene lugar el verdadero comportamiento emergente?• ¿Las técnicas actuales se desarrollan en el diseño de sistemas de detección de intrusos y contramedidas y sistemas sobrevivibles efectivos contra esta nueva clase de gusanos?;y • ¿Qué técnicas, si alguna, se pueden desarrollar para crear defensas contra gusanos enjambres?6. Agradecimientos Este trabajo se realizó como parte de un mayor esfuerzo en el desarrollo de los sistemas de detección de intrusos y contramedidas de próxima generación en WSSRL.

        "The basic concepts that have been developed over the last decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include four basic components.",
        "These are: 1.",
        "Simplicity of logic & actions: A swarm is composed of N agents whose intelligence is limited.",
        "Agents in the swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions.",
        "Some models called this primitive actions or behaviors; 2.",

        "This model, which extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2.",
        "In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms.",

        "In section 4, preliminary results via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is presented.",
        "Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights into future work are presented. 2.",
        "WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance.",
        "In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions.",
        "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
        "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
        "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
        "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
        "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
        "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
        "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
        "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
        "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
        "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
        "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
        "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
        "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
        "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
        "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
        "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
        "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
        "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
        "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
        "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
        "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
        "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
        "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
        "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
        "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
        "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
        "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
        "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
        "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
        "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
        "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
        "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
        "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
        "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
        "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
        "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
        "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
        "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
        "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
        "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
        "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
        "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
        "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
        "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
        "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
        "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
        "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
        "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
        "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
        "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
        "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
        "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
        "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
        "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
        "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
        "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
        "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
        "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
        "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
        "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
        "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",
        "These are: 1.",
        "Simplicity of logic & actions; 2.",
        "Local Communication Mechanisms; 3.",
        "Distributed control; and 4.",
        "Emergent Intelligence, including self-organization. 325 Structure Function/Example Infection, Infection Vector Executable is run Protection & Stealthiness Disable McAfee (Staying Alive) Propagation Send email to everyone in address book Goal Based Action (GBA) DDoS www.sco.com Everything else, often called payload Figure 1: General Worm Model In this work we aggregate all of these attributes under the general title of Learning, Communication, and Distributed Control.",
        "The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of malware such as Zombies.",
        "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
        "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",
        "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
        "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
        "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
        "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",
        "Specifically, • DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN − 99 − 04.html).",
        "DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm Attacks due to the large number of agents involved. • Code Red CrV1, Code Red II, Nimbda - Exhibit early notions of swarm attacks, including a backdoor communication channel. • Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1, Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of behavior.",
        "For example, they speculate on new worms which employ direct worm-to-worm communication, and employ programmable updates.",
        "For example the Warhol worm, and Permutation-Scanning (self coordinating) worms. 2.6 Swarm Worm: the details In considering the creation of what we believed to be the first Swarm Worm in existence, we wanted to adhere as close as possible to the general model presented in section ? ? while at the same time facilitating large scale analysis, both empirical and through simulations, of the behavior of the swarm.",

        "The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords.",
        "Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates.",
        "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
        "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
        "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
        "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
        "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
        "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
        "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
        "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
        "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
        "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
        "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
        "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
        "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
        "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
        "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
        "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
        "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
        "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
        "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
        "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
        "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
        "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
        "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
        "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
        "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
        "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
        "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
        "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
        "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
        "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
        "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
        "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
        "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
        "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
        "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
        "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
        "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
        "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
        "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
        "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
        "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
        "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",
        "The network testbed consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.",
        "The simulator was written in C++ .",
        "The simple swarm worm described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm behaviors.",
        "In the case of a simple local area network of 30 computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected.",
        "At the start of the experiment a single known password is known, that of patient-zero.",
        "All shared passwords are distributed randomly across all nodes.",
        "Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.",
        "Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to specific network topologies subnets.",
        "For example, in one of our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200 subnets each containing 50 hosts.",
        "In such a topology, shared passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying percentage of passwords were shared across subnets.",
        "The percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords were found to be shared. 4.",
        "RESULTS In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN are presented.",
        "In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords.",
        "The data presented reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms.",
        "The class of worms presented are as follows: • I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with neighbors or offsprings (NS); • S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP) across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and • S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and offsprings.",
        "As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient and dangerous than generic worms.",
        "In this set of experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm.",
        "Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than its generic counterpart.",
        "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
        "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
        "Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.",
        "Note that it is trivial for a swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password space.",
        "In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are presented.",

        "The data presented reflects the behaviors of three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies (random scanning and local bias).",
        "The amount of local bias was varied across multiple simulation runs.",

        "In general the following class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated.",
        "Address Scanning: • Random:= addresses are selected at random from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space; and • Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224 address space.",

        "Local preference is incredibly effective. 2.",
        "Short address handoffs are more effective than long ones.",
        "We varied the size of the list allowed in the sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a long address list is detrimental to the performance of the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness; 3.",
        "For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings 328 at creation time) is more effective than sharing passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm.",
        "In this case, we can think of the swarm as launching a distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use different passwords to try to break into susceptible uninfected host.",
        "In the local bias mode, early in the life of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered.",
        "Then the targeting of local addresses assists in discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and 4.",
        "Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time in non-local bias mode.",

                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Within 10 minutes after the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant disruption to the global Internet infrastructure.",
                "Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction.",
                "Since Slammer, researchers have explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms.",
                "For example, Zou, et al., [2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to detect the early propagation of a worm.",
                "Other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the organization to the potential presence of a worm.",
                "However, such strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome.",
                "That is, systems are being designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.",
                "In the work described here, we put forth the hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations.",
                "Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence.",
                "The concept of emergent intelligence was first studied in association with biological systems.",
                "In such studies, early researchers discovered a variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild.",

                "Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and 323 attempted to create models that explain how the elements of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve.",
                "Moreover, in recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in transportation systems, in military applications, and other areas, see [3].",

                "This model, which extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2.",
                "In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms.",

                "Such Swarm Worms are potentially more harmful than their similar generic counterparts.",

                "WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance.",
                "In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions.",
                "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
                "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
                "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a <br>swarm worm</br>. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",

                "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
                "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a <br>swarm worm</br> due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",
                "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
                "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
                "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
                "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",
                "Specifically, • DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN − 99 − 04.html).",

                "Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates.",
                "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
                "We call this <br>swarm worm</br> the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a <br>swarm worm</br> including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a <br>swarm worm</br>, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",

                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",

                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",

                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",

                "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
                "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",
                "Basically, as soon as a password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are infected within a few seconds.",

                "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
                "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
                "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",

                "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
                "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",
                "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
                "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
                "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
                "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",
                "Specifically, • DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN − 99 − 04.html).",

                "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",

                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",

                "The importance of <br>zachik</br> is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "<br>zachik</br> is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike <br>zachik</br>, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of <br>zachik</br> worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the <br>zachik</br> worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",

                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the <br>zachik</br> worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the <br>zachik</br> worm has two basic goals.",

                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen <br>prng method</br> and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",

                "The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of malware such as Zombies.",
                "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
                "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",

                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",

                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",

                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",

                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",

                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",

                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",

                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",

                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",

                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",

                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",

                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",

                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",

                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",

                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",

                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",

                "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
                "The new member messages are messages that a new instance sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.",
                "The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor list.",
                "These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause the instances beneath it to be inaccessible.",
                "The passwords messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords, and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects this information, which allows it to infect new instances more effectively.",
                "The handoffs messages inform instances of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at breaking the password for the root account).",
                "Since the address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time (i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address.",
                "Therefore, by handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses (b) attacking more effectively.",
                "In a way, this is a simple instance of coordinated activity of a swarm. 2.10.2 Coordination When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence to all neighbors on its list.",
                "The main thread then spawns a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, receiving addresses and relaying these messages). 2.10.3 Distributed Control Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions independently of every other instance while at the same time benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate neighbors. 2.11 Goal Based Actions The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic goals.",
                "These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share with members of th swarm new root passwords. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known 327 worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator, capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies (IPV4 space), was developed.",

                "In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.",
                "These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample space used for this experiment.",

                "Within 10 minutes after the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant disruption to the global Internet infrastructure.",
                "Vern Paxson of the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part, from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior, namely self-reproduction.",
                "Since Slammer, researchers have explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms.",
                "For example, Zou, et al., [2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to detect the early propagation of a worm.",
                "Other researchers have proposed the use of detectors where rates of Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the organization to the potential presence of a worm.",
                "However, such strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome.",

                "Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of emergent intelligence.",
                "The concept of emergent intelligence was first studied in association with biological systems.",
                "In such studies, early researchers discovered a variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild.",

                "WORM MODELING In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general, it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a specific instance.",
                "In this section, we described such a model where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic components or subfunctions.",
                "By definition, a worm is a selfcontained, self propagating program.",
                "Thus, in simple terms, it has two main functions: that which propagates and that which does other things.",
                "We propose that there is a third broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation.",
                "We also propose that the other functionality of a worm may be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions (GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals) the author has.",
                "The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here. 2.1 Propagation The propagation function itself may be broken down into three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.",
                "Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack next.",
                "Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely populated.",
                "This may involve a simple ping to check if the host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment.",
                "Infecting the target is the actual method used to send the worm code to the new host.",
                "In algorithm form: propagate() { host := acquire_target() success := send_scan(host) if( success ) then infect(host) endif } In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer), the scan method is dropped: propagate() { host := acquire_target() infect(host) } Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and CPU or network load.",
                "Depending on the authors needs or requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be included in the worms actions.",
                "This is discussed further after expanding upon these actions below. 2.2 Target Acquisition: The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5].",
                "Weaver et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories.",
                "Here, we further extend their work through parameterization.",
                "Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based method for choosing a host.",
                "Any type of equation may be used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local preference.",
                "Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at an IP address and increment through all the IP space.",
                "This could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and 324 how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or subnet-based).",
                "Random scanning is completely at random (depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).",
                "Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the traditional 80/20 split).",
                "Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists, or so called hit-lists, could include the options for percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just number of IPs to include.",
                "Implicit to this type is the fact that the list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.",
                "Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally generated target lists depend on one or more external sources that can be queried for host data.",
                "This will involve either servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm author.",
                "The normally available meta-servers could have parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at night or leaving in the morning.",
                "Each server could also have a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.",
                "The worm would also need a way of finding these servers, either hard-coded or through scanning.",
                "Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly dependent on the infected host.",
                "This method could parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, particular servers, number of internal/external, or some combination.",
                "Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal interactions between hosts.",
                "Parameters may include a rate of interaction with particular machines, internal/external rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.",
                "Any of these methods may also be combined to produce different types of target acquisition strategies.",
                "For example, the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different hosts or subnets.",
                "Once it has exhausted its search using the hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning with a 50% local bias.",
                "It is important to note, however, that the resource consumption of each method is not the same.",
                "Different methods may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.",
                "Further research and analysis should be performed in this area to determine associated costs for using each method.",
                "The costs could then be used in determining design tradeoffs that worm authors engage at.",
                "For example, hit lists provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm payload size. 2.2.1 Sending a Scan The send scan function tests to see if the host is available for infection.",
                "This can be as simple as checking if the host is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is vulnerable to the exploit which will be used.",
                "The sending of a scan before attempted infection can increase the scanning rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and failures are more frequent than successes.",
                "One important parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol (TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan and time for one failed scan.",
                "Also, whether or not it tests for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability (or for multiple vulnerabilities). 2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV) The particular infection vector used to access the remote host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability chosen to exploit.",
                "In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be sent.",
                "Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded. 2.3 Self Preservation The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many forms.",
                "In the wild, worms have been observed to disable anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain antivirusknown addresses.",
                "They have also been seen to attempt disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same system.",
                "We also believe that a time-based throttled scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar.",
                "We also propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not noticed.",
                "It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some way.",
                "This module could contain parameters for: probability of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates, probability of being noticed and thus removed, or hardening of the host against other worms. 2.4 Goal-Based Actions A worms GBA functionality depends on the authors goal list.",
                "The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful suggestions for such a module.",
                "The opening of a back-door can make the host susceptible to more attacks.",
                "This would involve a probability of the back-door being used and any associated traffic utilization.",
                "It could also provide a list of other worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of vulnerabilities this host now has.",
                "Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic pattern.",
                "Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of activation, a target, and a traffic pattern.",
                "Data damage would have an associated probability that the host dies because of the damage.",
                "In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.",
                "Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or very little, sharing of information between worm instances, and certainly no coordination of actions.",
                "In the next section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm. 2.5 Swarms - General Model As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.",

                "The presence of these attributes distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other types of malware such as Zombies.",
                "In figure ? ?, the generic model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.",
                "Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share information.",
                "On the other hand, Zombies and many other forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm worms are not.",
                "This is simply due to fact that in the case of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized, and no emergent behaviors arise.",
                "The latter, the potential emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes swarm worms so potentially dangerous.",
                "Finally, when one considers the majority of recent disruptions to the Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as precursors to truly swarm behavior.",
                "Specifically, • DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http : //www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN − 99 − 04.html).",
                "DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm Attacks due to the large number of agents involved. • Code Red CrV1, Code Red II, Nimbda - Exhibit early notions of swarm attacks, including a backdoor communication channel. • Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1, Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of behavior.",

                "The objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially attempting to login into the host using well known passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random passwords.",
                "Once, a host is infected, the worm will create communication channels with both its known neighbors at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it successfully generates.",
                "In this context a successful generation of an offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating an exact copy of itself in such a host.",
                "We call this swarm worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators.",
                "As it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm exhibits all of the elements described before.",
                "In the following sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of the ZachiK worm. 2.7 Infection Vector The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure shell protocol SSH.",
                "A modified client which is capable of receiving passwords from the command line was written, and integrated with a script that supplies it with various passwords: known and random.",
                "When a password is found for an appropriate target, the infection process begins.",
                "After the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects the target host and replicates itself.",
                "The worm creates a new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh client, the script, the communications servers, and the updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a list of current neighbors).",
                "It then runs the modified script on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for new targets.",
                "It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins from the network.",
                "Within this context ZachiK can quickly be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does not require further study.",
                "However, the reader should consider the following: 1.",
                "ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of infection vectors.",
                "For example, it could be programmed to guess common user names and their passwords; gain 326 access to a system, then guess the root password or use other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges; 2.",
                "ZachiK is a proof of concept worm.",
                "The importance of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, distributed control, communication amongst agents, and learning; 3.",
                "ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents operating independently which lends itself naturally to parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the IPV4 address space.",
                "Within this context, SLAMMER, does incorporate a parallel search capability of potentially susceptible addresses.",
                "However, unlike ZachiK, the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared amongst the agents.",
                "For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace its study. 2.8 Self-Preservation In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation techniques used are simply keeping the payload small.",
                "In this context, this simply means restricting the number of passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm messages as common http requests, and restricting the number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5). 2.9 Propagation Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires thought.",
                "In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5], have applied propagation techniques that varied.",
                "These include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random selection (select a host target at random from a local subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above.",
                "In our test and simulation environments, we will apply a combination of locally biased and totally random selection of potential vulnerable hosts.",
                "However, due to the fact that the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information will be shared amongst members of the swarm.",
                "The infection and propagation threads do the following set of activities repeatedly: • Choose an address • Check the validity of the address • Choose a set of passwords • Try infecting the selected host with this set of passwords As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.",
                "Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either: • Generate a new random address • Generate an address on the local network • Pick an address from a handoff list The choice is made randomly among these options, and can be varied to test the dependency of propagation on particular choices.",
                "Password are either chosen from the list of known passwords or newly generated.",
                "When an infection of a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which is sent to the neighbors to try to work on. 2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed Control 2.10.1 Communication The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm instance in the swarm is aware of these messages.",
                "There are two classes of messages: data or information messages and commands.",
                "The command messages are meant for an external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.",
                "The information messages are currently of three kinds: new member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).",
