The main positive results are the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms and computationally efficient mechanisms for severely restricted players (single-parameter domains). As it turns out, many natural social goals cannot be implemented using the dominant strategy concept [35, 32, 22, 20]. This suggests that the standard requirements must be relaxed in order to construct general-purpose mechanisms. We observe that in many common distributed environments computational entities can take advantage of the network structure to collect and distribute information. We thus suggest a notion of partially informed environments. Even if the information is recorded with some probability, this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals, using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies. As a result, cooperation is achieved independent of agents belief. As a case study, we apply our methods to derive Peer-to-Peer network mechanism for file sharing. Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Design, Algorithms 1. INTRODUCTION Recently, global networks have attracted widespread study. The emergence of popular scalable shared networks with self-interested entities - such as peer-to-peer systems over the Internet and mobile wireless communication ad-hoc networks - poses fundamental challenges. Naturally, the study of such giant decentralized systems involves aspects of game theory [32, 34]. In particular, the subfield of Mechanism Design deals with the construction of mechanisms: for a given social goal the challenge is to design rules for interaction such that selfish behavior of the agents will result in the desired social goal [23, 33]. Algorithmic Mechanism Design (AMD) focuses on efficiently computable constructions [32]. Distributed Algorithmic Mechanism Design (DAMD) studies mechanism design in inherently decentralized settings [30, 12]. The standard model assumes rational agents with quasi-linear utilities and private information, playing dominant strategies. The solution concept of dominant strategies - in which each player has a best response strategy regardless of the strategy played by any other player - is well suited to the assumption of private information, in which each player is not assumed to have knowledge or beliefs regarding the other players. The appropriateness of this set-up stems from the strength of the solution concept, which complements the weak information assumption. Many mechanisms have been constructed using this set-up, e.g., [1, 4, 6, 11, 14, 22]. Most of these apply to severely-restricted cases (e.g., single-item auctions with no externalities) in which a players preference is described by only one parameter (single-parameter domains). To date, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms are the only known general method for designing dominant strategy mechanisms for general domains of preferences. However, in distributed settings without available subsidies from outside sources, VCG mechanisms cannot be accepted as valid solutions due to a serious lack of budget balance. Additionally, for some domains of preferences, VCG mechanisms and weighted VCG mechanisms are faced with computational hardness [22, 20]. Further limitations of the set-up are discussed in subsection 1.3. In most distributed environments, players can take advantage of the network structure to collect and distribute information about other players. This paper thus studies the effects of relaxing the private information assumption. 240 One model that has been extensively studied recently is the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is a distributed network with no centralized authority, in which the participants share their individual resources (e.g., processing power, storage capacity, bandwidth and content). The aggregation of such resources provides inexpensive computational platforms. The most popular P2P networks are those for sharing media files, such as Napster, Gnutella, and Kazaa. Recent work on P2P Incentives include micropayment methods [15] and reputation-based methods [9, 13]. The following description of a P2P network scenario illustrates the relevance of our relaxed informational assumption. Example 1. Consider a Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing. Whenever agent B uploads a file from agent A, all peers along the routing path know that B has loaded the file. They can record this information about agent B. In addition, they can distribute this information. However, it is impossible to record all the information everywhere. First, such duplication induces huge costs. Second, as agents dynamically enter and exit from the network, the information might not be always available. And so it is seems natural to consider environments in which the information is locally recorded, that is, the information is recorded in the closest neighborhood with some probability p. In this paper we shall see that if the information is available with some probability, then this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals. As a result, cooperation is achieved independent of agents belief. This demonstrates that in some computational contexts our approach is far less demanding than the Bayesian approach (that assumes that players types are drawn according to some identified probability density function). 1.1 Implementations in Complete Information Set-ups In complete information environments, each agent is informed about everyone else. That is, each agent observes his own preference and the preferences of all other agents. However, no outsider can observe this information. Specifically, neither the mechanism designer nor the court. Many positive results were shown for such arguably realistic settings. For recent surveys see [25, 27, 18]. Moore and Repullo implement a large class of social goals using sequential mechanisms with a small number of rounds [28]. The concept they used is subgame-perfect implementations (SPE). The SPE-implementability concept seems natural for the following reasons: the designed mechanisms usually have non-artificial constructs and a small strategy space. As a result, it is straightforward for a player to compute his strategy.1 Second, sequential mechanisms avoid simultaneous moves, and thus can be considered for distributed networks. Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies. One such widely studied case is the Ultimatum Bargaining 2-person game. In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero. Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero). This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents. Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him. 1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general. In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability. More formally, we say that agent B is p-informed about agent A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies. We demonstrate this concept through some motivating examples that (i) seem natural in distributed settings and (ii) cannot be implemented in dominant strategies even if there is an authorized center with a direct connection to every agent or even if players have single-parameter domains. 1. We first show how the subgame perfect techniques of Moore and Repullo [28] can be applied to p-informed environments and further adjusted to the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (for large enough p). 2. We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3. We consider implementations in various network structures. As a case study we apply our methods to derive: (1) Simplified Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing with no payments in equilibrium. Our approach is (agent, file)-specific. (2) Web-cache budget-balanced and economically efficient mechanism. Our mechanisms use reasonable punishments that inversely depend on p. And so, if the fines are large then small p is enough to induce cooperation. Essentially, large p implies a large amount of recorded information. 1.2.1 Malicious Agents Decentralized mechanisms often utilize punishing outcomes. As a result, malicious players might cause severe harm to others. We suggest a quantified notion of malicious player, who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm caused to others. [12] suggests several categories to classify non-cooperating players. Our approach is similar to [7] (and the references therein), who considered independently such players in different context. We show a simple decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and in particular, do not use their punishing actions in equilibrium. 241 1.3 Dominant Strategy Implementations In this subsection we shall refer to some recent results demonstrating that the set-up of private information with the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general. First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35]. For slightly-restricted preference domains, it is not known how to turn efficiently computable algorithms into dominant strategy mechanisms. This was observed and analyzed in [32, 22, 31]. Recently [20] extends Roberts result to some leading examples. They showed that under mild assumptions any dominant strategy mechanism for variety of Combinatorial Auctions over multi-dimensional domains must be almost weighted VCG. Additionally, it turns out that the dominant strategy requirement implies that the social goal must be monotone [35, 36, 22, 20, 5, 37]. This condition is very restrictive, as many desired natural goals are non-monotone2 . Several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant strategy concept: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21]. However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]). Recently, [8, 3] considered implementations for generalized single-parameter players. Organization of this paper: In section 2 we illustrate the concepts of subgame perfect and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies in completely-informed and partially-informed environments. In section 3 we show a mechanism for Peer-to-Peer file sharing networks. In section 4 we apply our methods to derive a web cache mechanism. Future work is briefly discussed in section 5. 2. MOTIVATING EXAMPLES In this section we examine the concepts of subgame perfect and iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies for completely informed and p-informed environments. We also present the notion of q-maliciousness and some other related considerations through two illustrative examples. 2.1 The Fair Assignment Problem Our first example is an adjustment to computerized context of an ancient procedure to ensure that the wealthiest man in Athens would sponsor a theatrical production known as the Choregia [27]. In the fair assignment problem, Alice and Bob are two workers, and there is a new task to be performed. Their goal is to assign the task to the least loaded worker without any monetary transfers. The informational assumption is that Alice and Bob know both loads and the duration of the new task.3 2 E.g., minimizing the makespan within a factor of 2 [32] and Rawls Rule over some multi-dimensional domains [20]. 3 In first glance one might ask why the completely informed agents could not simply sign a contract, specifying the desired goal. Such a contract is sometimes infeasible due to fact that the true state cannot be observed by outsiders, especially not the court. Claim 1. The fair assignment goal cannot be implemented in dominant strategies.4 2.1.1 Basic Mechanism The following simple mechanism implements this goal in subgame perfect equilibrium. • Stage 1: Alice either agrees to perform the new task or refuses. • Stage 2: If she refuses, Bob has to choose between: - (a) Performing the task himself. - (b) Exchanging his load with Alice and performing the new task as well. Let LT A, LT B be the true loads of Alice and Bob, and let t > 0 be the load of the new task. Assume that load exchanging takes zero time and cost. We shall see that the basic mechanism achieves the goal in a subgame perfect equilibrium. Intuitively this means that in equilibrium each player will choose his best action at each point he might reach, assuming similar behavior of others, and thus every SPE is a Nash equilibrium. Claim 2. ([27]) The task is assigned to the least loaded worker in subgame perfect equilibrium. Proof. By backward induction argument (look forward and reason backward), consider the following cases: 1. LT B ≤ LT A. If stage 2 is reached then Bob will not exchange. 2. LT A < LT B < LT A + t. If stage 2 is reached Bob will exchange, and this is what Alice prefers. 3. LT A + t ≤ LT B. If stage 2 is reached then Bob would exchange, as a result it is strictly preferable by Alice to perform the task. Note that the basic mechanism does not use monetary transfers at all and is decentralized in the sense that no third party is needed to run the procedure. The goal is achieved in equilibrium (ties are broken in favor of Alice). However, in the second case exchange do occur in an equilibrium point. Recall the unrealistic assumption that load exchange takes zero time and cost. Introducing fines, the next mechanism overcomes this drawback. 2.1.2 Elicitation Mechanism In this subsection we shall see a centralized mechanism for the fair assignment goal without load exchange in equilibrium. The additional assumptions are as follows. The cost performing a load of duration d is exactly d. We assume that the duration t of the new task is < T. The payoffs 4 proof: Assume that there exists a mechanism that implements this goal in dominant strategies. Then by the Revelation Principle [23] there exists a mechanism that implements this goal for which the dominant strategy of each player is to report his true load. Clearly, truthfully reporting cannot be a dominant strategy for this goal (if monetary transfers are not available), as players would prefer to report higher loads. 242 of the utility maximizers agents are quasilinear. The following mechanism is an adaptation of Moore and Repullos elicitation mechanism [28]5 . • Stage 1: (Elicitation of Alices load) Alice announces LA. Bob announces LA ≤ LA. If LA = LA (Bob agrees) goto the next Stage. Otherwise (Bob challenges), Alice is assigned the task. She then has to choose between: - (a) Transferring her original load to Bob and paying him LA − 0.5 · min{ , LA − LA}. Alice pays to the mechanism. Bob pays the fine of T + to the mechanism. - (b) No load transfer. Alice pays to Bob. STOP. • Stage 2: The elicitation of Bobs load is similar to Stage 1 (switching the roles of Alice and Bob). • Stage 3: If LA < LB Alice is assigned the task, otherwise Bob. STOP. Observe that Alice is assigned the task and fined with whenever Bob challenges. We shall see that the bonus of is paid to a challenging player only in out of equilibria cases. Claim 3. If the mechanism stops at Stage 3, then the payoff of each agent is at least −t and at most 0. Proposition 1. It is a subgame perfect equilibrium of the elicitation mechanism to report the true load, and to challenge with the true load only if the other agent overreports. Proof. Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alices load is done after Bobs, and that Stage 2 is reached. If Alice truly reports LA = LT A, Bob strictly prefers to agree. Otherwise, if Bob challenges, Alice would always strictly prefer to transfer (as in this case Bob would perform her load for smaller cost), as a result Bob would pay T + to the mechanism. This punishing outcome is less preferable than the normal outcome of Stage 3 achieved had he agreed. If Alice misreports LA > LT A, then Bob can ensure himself the bonus (which is always strictly preferable than reaching Stage 3) by challenging with LA = LT A, and so whenever Bob gets the bonus Alice gains the worst of all payoffs. Reporting a lower load LA < LT A is not beneficial for Alice. In this case, Bob would strictly prefer to agree (and not to announce LA < LA, as he limited to challenge with a smaller load than what she announces). Thus such misreporting can only increase the possibility that she is assigned the task. And so there is no incentive for Alice to do so. All together, Alice would prefer to report the truth in this stage. And so Stage 2 would not abnormally end by STOP, and similarly Stage 1. Observe that the elicitation mechanism is almost balanced: in all outcomes no money comes in or out, except for the non-equilibrium outcome (a), in which both players pay to the mechanism. 5 In [28], if an agent misreport his type then it is always beneficial to the other agent to challenge. In particular, even if the agent reports a lower load. 2.1.3 Elicitation Mechanism for Partially Informed Agents In this subsection we consider partially informed agents. Formally: Definition 1. An agent A is p-informed about agent B, if A knows the type of B with probability p (independently of what B knows). It turns out that a version of the elicitation mechanism works for this relaxed information assumption, if we use the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies6 . We replace the fixed fine of in the elicitation mechanism with the fine: βp = max{L, 1 − p 2p − 1 T} + , and assume the bounds LT A, LT B ≤ L. Proposition 2. If all agents are p-informed, p > 0.5, the elicitation mechanism(βp) implements the fair assignment goal with the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies. The strategy of each player is to report the true load and to challenge with the true load if the other agent overreport. Proof. Assume w.l.o.g that the elicitation of Alices load is done after Bobs, and that Stage 2 is reached. First observe that underreporting the true value is a dominated strategy, whether Bob is not informed and mistakenly challenges with a lower load (as βp ≥ L) or not, or even if t is very small. Now we shall see that overreporting her value is a dominated strategy, as well. Alices expected payoff gained by misreporting ≤ p (payoff if she lies and Bob is informed) +(1 − p) (max payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤ p (−t − βp) < p (−t) + (1 − p) (−t − βp) ≤ p (min payoff of true report if Bob is informed) + (1 − p) (min payoff if Bob is not informed) ≤ Alices expected payoff if she truly reports. The term (−t−βp) in the left hand side is due to the fact that if Bob is informed he will always prefer to challenge. In the right hand side, if he is informed, then challenging is a dominated strategy, and if he is not informed the worst harm he can make is to challenge. Thus in stage 2 Alice will report her true load. This implies that challenging without being informed is a dominated strategy for Bob. This argument can be reasoned also for the first stage, when Bob reports his value. Bob knows the maximum payoff he can gain is at most zero since he cannot expect to get the bonus in the next stage. 2.1.4 Extensions The elicitation mechanism for partially informed agents is rather general. As in [28], we need the capability to judge between two distinct declarations in the elicitation rounds, 6 A strategy si of player i is weakly dominated if there exists si such that (i) the payoff gained by si is at least as high as the payoff gained by si, for all strategies of the other players and all preferences, and (ii) there exist a preference and a combination of strategies for the other players such that the payoff gained by si is strictly higher than the payoff gained by si. 243 and upper and lower bounds based on the possible payoffs derived from the last stage. In addition, for p-informed environments, some structure is needed to ensure that underbidding is a dominated strategy. The Choregia-type mechanisms can be applied to more than 2 players with the same number of stages: the player in the first stage can simply points out the name of the wealthiest agent. Similarly, the elicitation mechanisms can be extended in a straightforward manner. These mechanisms can be budget-balanced, as some player might replace the role of the designer, and collect the fines, as observed in [28]. Open Problem 1. Design a decentralized budget balanced mechanism with reasonable fines for independently p-informed n players, where p ≤ 1 − 1/2 1 n−1 . 2.2 Seller and Buyer Scenario A player might cause severe harm to others by choosing a non-equilibrium outcome. In the mechanism for the fair assignment goal, an agent might maliciously challenge even if the other agent truly reports his load. In this subsection we consider such malicious scenarios. For the ease of exposition we present a second example. We demonstrate that equilibria remain unchanged even if players are malicious. In the seller-buyer example there is one item to be traded and two possible future states. The goal is to sell the item for the average low price pl = ls+lb 2 in state L, and the higher price ph = hs+hb 2 in the other state H, where ls is sellers cost and lb is buyers value in state L, and similarly hs, hb in H. The players fix the prices without knowing what will be the future state. Assume that ls < hs < lb < hb, and that trade can occur in both prices (that is, pl, ph ∈ (hs, lb)). Only the players can observe the realization of the true state. The payoffs are of the form ub = xv−tb, us = ts −xvs, where the binary variable x indicates if trade occurred, and tb, ts are the transfers. Consider the following decentralized trade mechanism. • Stage 1: If seller reports H goto Stage 2. Otherwise, trade at the low price pl. STOP. • Stage 2: The buyer has to choose between: - (a) Trade at the high price ph. - (b) No trade and seller pays ∆ to the buyer. Claim 4. Let ∆ = lb−ph+ . The unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the trade mechanism is to report the true state in Stage 1 and trading if Stage 2 is reached. Note that the outcome (b) is never chosen in equilibrium. 2.2.1 Trade Mechanism for Malicious Agents The buyer might maliciously punish the seller by choosing the outcome (b) when the true state is H. The following notion quantifies the consideration that a player is not indifferent to the private surpluses of others. Definition 2. A player is q-malicious if his payoff equals: (1 − q) (his private surplus) − q (summation of others surpluses), q ∈ [0, 1]. This definition appeared independently in [7] in different context. We shall see that the traders would avoid such bad behavior if they are q-malicious, where q < 0.5, that is if their non-indifference impact is bounded by 0.5. Equilibria outcomes remain unchanged, and so cooperation is achieved as in the original case of non-malicious players. Consider the trade mechanism with pl = (1 − q) hs + q lb , ph = q hs + (1 − q) lb , ∆ = (1 − q) (hb − lb − ). Note that pl < ph for q < 0.5. Claim 5. If q < 0.5, then the unique subgame perfect equilibrium for q-malicious players remains unchanged. Proof. By backward induction we consider two cases. In state H, the q-malicious buyer would prefer to trade if (1 − q)(hb − ph) + q(hs − ph) > (1 − q)∆ + q(∆). Indeed, (1 − q)hb + qhs > ∆ + ph. Trivially, the seller prefers to trade at the higher price, (1 − q)(pl − hs) + q(pl − hb) < (1 − q)(ph − hs) + q(ph − hb). In state L the buyer prefers the no trade outcome, as (1−q)(lb −ph)+q(ls −ph) < ∆. The seller prefers to trade at a low price, as (1 − q)(pl − ls) + q(pl − lb) > 0 > −∆. 2.2.2 Discussion No mechanism can Nash-implement this trading goal if the only possible outcomes are trade at pl and trade at ph. To see this, it is enough to consider normal forms (as any extensive form mechanism can be presented as a normal one). Consider a matrix representation, where the seller is the row player and the buyer is the column player, in which every entry includes an outcome. Suppose there is equilibrium entry for the state L. The associate column must be all pl, otherwise the seller would have an incentive to deviate. Similarly, the associate row of the H equilibrium entry must be all ph (otherwise the buyer would deviate), a contradiction. 7 8 The buyer prefers pl and seller ph, and so the preferences are identical in both states. Hence reporting preferences over outcomes is not enough - players must supply additional information. This is captured by outcome (b) in the trade mechanism. Intuitively, if a goal is not Nash-implementable we need to add more outcomes. The drawback is that some new additional equilibria must be ruled out. E.g., additional Nash equilibrium for the trade mechanism is (trade at pl, (b)). That is, the seller chooses to trade at low price at either states, and the buyer always chooses the no trade option that fines the seller, if the second stage is reached. Such buyers threat is not credible, because if the mechanism is played only once, and Stage 2 is reached in state H, the buyer would strictly decrease his payoff if he chooses (b). Clearly, this is not a subgame perfect equilibrium. Although each extensive game-form is strategically equivalent to a normal form one, the extensive form representation places more structure and so it seems plausible that the subgame perfect equilibrium will be played.9 7 Formally, this goal is not Maskin monotonic, a necessary condition for Nash-implementability [24]. 8 A similar argument applies for the Fair Assignment Problem. 9 Interestingly, it is a straight forward to construct a sequential mechanism with unique SPE, and additional NE with a strictly larger payoff for every player. 244 3. PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS In this section we describe a simplified Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing, without payments in equilibrium, using a certificate-based challenging method. In this challenging method - as opposed to [28] - an agent that challenges cannot harm other agents, unless he provides a valid certificate. In general, if agent B copied a file f from agent A, then agent A knows that agent B holds a copy of the file. We denote such information as a certificate(B, f) (we shall omit cryptographic details). Such a certificate can be recorded and distributed along the network, and so we can treat each agent holding the certificate as an informed agent. Assumptions: We assume an homogeneous system with files of equal size. The benefit each agent gains by holding a copy of any file is V . The only cost each agent has is the uploading cost C (induced while transferring a file to an immediate neighbor). All other costs are negligible (e.g., storing the certificates, forwarding messages, providing acknowledgements, digital signatures, etc). Let upA, downA be the numbers of agent A uploads and downloads if he always cooperates. We assume that each agent A enters the system if upA · C < downA · V . Each agent has a quasilinear utility and only cares about his current bandwidth usage. In particular, he ignores future scenarios (e.g., whether forwarding or dropping of a packet might affect future demand). 3.1 Basic Mechanism We start with a mechanism for a network with 3 p-informed agents: B, A1, A2. We assume that B is directly connected to A1 and A2. If B has the certificate(A1, f), then he can apply directly to A1 and request the file (if he refuses, then B can go to court). The following basic sequential mechanism is applicable whenever agent B is not informed and still would like to download the file if it exists in the network. Note that this goal cannot be implemented in dominant strategies without payments (similar to Claim 1, when the type of each agent here is the set of files he holds). Define tA,B to be the monetary amount that agent A should transfer to B. • Stage 1: Agent B requests the file f from A1. - If A1 replies yes then B downloads the file from A1. STOP. - Otherwise, agent B sends A1s no reply to agent A2. ∗ If A2 declares agree then goto the next stage. ∗ Else, A2 sends a certificate(A1, f) to agent B. · If the certificate is correct then tA1,A2 = βp. STOP. · Else tA2,A1 = |C| + . STOP. Stage 2: Agent B requests the file f from A2. Switch the roles of the agents A1, A2. Claim 6. The basic mechanism is budget-balanced (transfers always sum to zero) and decentralized. Theorem 1. Let βp = |C| p + , p ∈ (0, 1]. A strategy that survives iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies is to reply yes if Ai holds the file, and to challenge only with a valid certificate. As a result, B downloads the file if some agent holds it, in equilibrium. There are no payments or transfers in equilibrium. Proof. Clearly if the mechanism ends without challenging: −C ≤ u(Ai) ≤ 0. And so, challenging with an invalid certificate is always a dominated strategy. Now, when Stage 2 is reached, A2 is the last to report if he has the file. If A2 has the file it is a weakly undominated strategy to misreport, whether A1 is informed or not: A2s expected payoff gained by misreporting no ≤ p · (−βp) + (1 − p) · 0 < −C ≤ A2s payoff if she reports yes. This argument can be reasoned also for Stage 1, when A1 reports whether he has the file. A1 knows that A2 will report yes if and only if she has the file in the next stage, and so the maximum payoff he can gain is at most zero since he cannot expect to get a bonus. 3.2 Chain Networks In a chain network, agent B is directly connected to A1, and Ai is directly connected to agent Ai+1. Assume that we have an acknowledgment protocol to confirm the receipt of a particular message. To avoid message dropping, we add the fine (βp +2 ) to be paid by an agent who hasnt properly forwarded a message. The chain mechanism follows: • Stage i: Agent B forwards a request for the file f to Ai (through {Ak}k≤i). • If Ai reports yes, then B downloads f from Ai. STOP. • Otherwise Ai reports no. If Aj sends a certificate(Ak, f) to B, ( j, k ≤ i), then - If certificate(Ak, f) is correct, then t(Ak, Aj) = βp. STOP. - Else, t(Aj, Ak) = C + . STOP. If Ai reports that he has no copy of the file, then any agent in between might challenge. Using digital signatures and acknowledgements, observe that every agent must forward each message, even if it contains a certificate showing that he himself has misreported. We use the same fine, βp, as in the basic mechanism, because the protocol might end at stage 1 (clearly, the former analysis still applies, since the actual p increases with the number of players). 3.3 Network Mechanism In this subsection we consider general network structures. We need the assumption that there is a ping protocol that checks whether a neighbor agent is on-line or not (that is, an on-line agent cannot hide himself). To limit the amount of information to be recorded, we assume that an agent is committed to keep any downloaded file to at least one hour, and so certificates are valid for a limited amount of time. We assume that each agent has a digitally signed listing of his current immediate neighbors. As in real P2P file sharing applications, we restrict each request for a file to be forwarded at most r times (that is, downloads are possible only inside a neighborhood of radius r). 245 The network mechanism utilizes the chain mechanism in the following way: When agent B requests a file from agent A (at most r − 1 far), then A sends to B the list of his neighbors and the output of the ping protocol to all of these neighbors. As a result, B can explore the network. Remark: In this mechanism we assumed that the environment is p-informed. An important design issue that it is not addressed here is the incentives for the information propagation phase. 4. WEB CACHE Web caches are widely used tool to improve overall system efficiency by allowing fast local access. They were listed in [12] as a challenging application of Distributed Algorithmic Mechanism Design. Nisan [30] considered a single cache shared by strategic agents. In this problem, agent i gains the value vT i if a particular item is loaded to the local shared cache. The efficient goal is to load the item if and only if ΣvT i ≥ C, where C is the loading cost. This goal reduces to the public project problem analyzed by Clarke [10]. However, it is well known that this mechanism is not budget-balanced (e.g., if the valuation of each player is C, then everyone pays zero). In this section we suggest informational and environmental assumptions for which we describe a decentralized budgetbalanced efficient mechanism. We consider environments for which future demand of each agent depends on past demand. The underlying informational and environmental requirements are as follows. 1. An agent can read the content of a message only if he is the target node (even if he has to forward the message as an intermediate node of some routing path). An agent cannot initiate a message on behalf of other agents. 2. An acknowledgement protocol is available, so that every agent can provide a certificate indicating that he handled a certain message properly. 3. Negligible costs: we assume p-informed agents, where p is such that the agents induced cost for keeping records of information is negligible. We also assume that the cost incurred by sending and forwarding messages is negligible. 4. Let qi(t) denotes the number of loading requests agent i initiated for the item during the time slot t. We assume that vT i (t), the value for caching the item in the beginning of slot t depends only on most recent slot, formally vT i (t) = max{Vi(qi(t − 1)), C}, where Vi(·) is a non-decreasing real function. In addition, Vi(·) is a common knowledge among the players. 5. The network is homogeneous in the sense that if agent j happens to handle k requests initiated by agent i during the time slot t, then qi(t) = kα, where α depends on the routing protocol and the environment (α might be smaller than 1, if each request is flooded several times). We assume that the only way agent i can affect the true qi(t) is by superficially increasing his demand for the cached item, but not the other way (that is, agents loss, incurred by giving up a necessary request for the item, is not negligible). The first requirement is to avoid free riding, and also to avoid the case that an agent superficially increases the demand of others and as a result decreases his own demand. The second requirement is to avoid the case that an agent who gets a routing request for the item, records it and then drops it. The third is to ensure that the environment stays well informed. In addition, if the forwarding cost is negligible each agent cooperates and forwards messages as he would not like to decrease the future demand (that monotonically depends on the current time slot, as assumed in the forth requirement) of some other agent. Given that the payments are increasing with the declared values, the forth and fifth requirements ensure that the agent would not increase his demand superficially and so qi(t) is the true demand. The following Web-Cache Mechanism implements the efficient goal that shares the cost proportionally. For simplicity it is described for two players and w.l.o.g vT i (t) equals the number of requests initiated by i and observed by any informed j (that is, α = 1 and Vi(qi(t − 1)) = qi(t − 1)). • Stage 1: (Elicitation of vT A(t)) Alice announces vA. Bob announces vA ≥ vA. If vA = vA goto the next Stage. Otherwise (Bob challenges): - If Bob provides vA valid records then Alice pays C to finance the loading of the item into the cache. She also pays βp to Bob. STOP. - Otherwise, Bob finances the loading of the item into the cache. STOP. • Stage 2: The elicitation of vT B(t) is done analogously. • Stage 3: If vA + vB < C, then STOP. Otherwise, load the item to the cache, Alice pays pA = vA vA+vB · C, and Bob pays pB = vB vA+vB · C. Claim 7. It is a dominated strategy to overreport the true value. Proof. Let vT A < VA. There are two cases to consider: • If vT A + vB < C and vA + vB ≥ C. We need to show that if the mechanism stops normally Alice would pay more than vT A, that is: vA vA+vB ·C > vT A. Indeed, vA C > vA (vT A + vB) > vT A (vA + vB). • If vT A + vB ≥ C, then clearly, vA vA+vB > vT A vT A +vB . Theorem 2. Let βp = max{0, 1−2p p · C} + , p ∈ (0, 1]. A strategy that survives iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies is to report the truth and to challenge only when the agent is informed. The mechanism is efficient, budget-balanced, exhibits consumer sovereignty, no positive transfer and individual rationality10 . Proof. Challenging without being informed (that is, without providing enough valid records) is always dominated strategy in this mechanism. Now, assume w.l.o.g. Alice is 10 See [29] or [12] for exact definitions. 246 the last to report her value. Alices expected payoff gained by underreporting ≤ p · (−C − βp) + (1 − p) · C < p · 0 + (1 − p) · 0 ≤ Alices expected payoff if she honestly reports. The right hand side equals zero as the participation costs are negligible. Reasoning back, Bob cannot expect to get the bonus and so misreporting is dominated strategy for him. 5. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this paper we have seen a new partial informational assumption, and we have demonstrated its suitability to networks in which computational agents can easily collect and distribute information. We then described some mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Some issues for future work include: • As we have seen, the implementation issue in p-informed environments is straightforward - it is easy to construct incentive compatible mechanisms even for non-singleparameter cases. The challenge is to find more realistic scenarios in which the partial informational assumption is applicable. • Mechanisms for information propagation and maintenance. In our examples we choose p such that the maintenance cost over time is negligible. However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs. As a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and selfish agents would not cooperate. Incentives for information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for P2P networks for file sharing). • It seems that some social choice goals cannot be implemented if each player is at least 1/n-malicious (where n is the number of players). It would be interesting to identify these cases.

    "original_translation": "Sobre los mecanismos compatibles con incentivos descentralizados para entornos parcialmente informados ∗ Ahuva Mualem School of Ingeniería e Informática La Universidad Hebrea de Jerusalén ahumu@cs.huji.ac.ac.il El diseño del mecanismo algorítmico abstracto se centra en las implementaciones de estrategias dominantes. Los principales resultados positivos son los célebres mecanismos de Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) y mecanismos computacionalmente eficientes para jugadores severamente restringidos (dominios de un solo parámetro). Como resultado, muchos objetivos sociales naturales no pueden implementarse utilizando el concepto de estrategia dominante [35, 32, 22, 20]. Esto sugiere que los requisitos estándar deben relajarse para construir mecanismos de uso general. Observamos que en muchos entornos distribuidos comunes, las entidades computacionales pueden aprovechar la estructura de la red para recopilar y distribuir información. Por lo tanto, sugerimos una noción de entornos parcialmente informados. Incluso si la información se registra con cierta probabilidad, esto nos permite implementar una gama más amplia de objetivos sociales, utilizando el concepto de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas. Como resultado, la cooperación se logra independientemente de la creencia de los agentes. Como estudio de caso, aplicamos nuestros métodos para derivar el mecanismo de red entre pares para compartir archivos. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Ciencias sociales y conductuales]: Economía General de Términos Diseño, Algoritmos 1. Introducción Recientemente, las redes globales han atraído un estudio generalizado. La aparición de redes compartidas escalables populares con entidades interesadas, como los sistemas entre pares a través de Internet y las redes ad-hoc de comunicación inalámbrica móvil, plantea desafíos fundamentales. Naturalmente, el estudio de tales sistemas descentralizados gigantes implica aspectos de la teoría del juego [32, 34]. En particular, el subcampo del diseño del mecanismo se ocupa de la construcción de mecanismos: para un objetivo social determinado, el desafío es diseñar reglas para la interacción, de modo que el comportamiento egoísta de los agentes dará como resultado el objetivo social deseado [23, 33]. El diseño del mecanismo algorítmico (AMD) se centra en construcciones eficientemente computables [32]. Diseño del mecanismo algorítmico distribuido (DAMD) Diseño del mecanismo de estudios en entornos inherentemente descentralizados [30, 12]. El modelo estándar asume agentes racionales con utilidades cuasi lineales e información privada, jugando estrategias dominantes. El concepto de solución de las estrategias dominantes, en las que cada jugador tiene una mejor estrategia de respuesta, independientemente de la estrategia que juegue cualquier otro jugador, se adapta bien a la suposición de información privada, en la que no se supone que cada jugador tenga conocimiento o creencias con respecto a laotros jugadores. La idoneidad de esta configuración proviene de la fuerza del concepto de solución, que complementa el supuesto de información débil. Se han construido muchos mecanismos utilizando esta configuración, por ejemplo, [1, 4, 6, 11, 14, 22]. La mayoría de estos se aplican a los casos severamente restringidos (por ejemplo, subastas de un solo elemento sin externalidades) en las que solo un parámetro se describe una preferencia de los jugadores (dominios de parámetro único). Hasta la fecha, los mecanismos de Groves de Vickrey-Clarke (VCG) son el único método general conocido para diseñar mecanismos de estrategia dominantes para dominios generales de preferencias. Sin embargo, en entornos distribuidos sin subsidios disponibles de fuentes externas, los mecanismos de VCG no pueden aceptarse como soluciones válidas debido a una grave falta de equilibrio presupuestario. Además, para algunos dominios de preferencias, los mecanismos de VCG y los mecanismos de VCG ponderados se enfrentan a la dureza computacional [22, 20]. Otras limitaciones de la configuración se discuten en la subsección 1.3. En la mayoría de los entornos distribuidos, los jugadores pueden aprovechar la estructura de la red para recopilar y distribuir información sobre otros jugadores. Por lo tanto, este documento estudia los efectos de relajar la suposición de información privada.240 Un modelo que se ha estudiado ampliamente recientemente es la red de igual a igual (P2P). Una red P2P es una red distribuida sin autoridad centralizada, en la que los participantes comparten sus recursos individuales (por ejemplo, potencia de procesamiento, capacidad de almacenamiento, ancho de banda y contenido). La agregación de tales recursos proporciona plataformas computacionales económicas. Las redes P2P más populares son aquellas para compartir archivos multimedia, como Napster, Gnutella y Kazaa. El trabajo reciente sobre los incentivos de P2P incluye métodos de micropapa [15] y métodos basados en la reputación [9, 13]. La siguiente descripción de un escenario de red P2P ilustra la relevancia de nuestra supuesta informativa relajada. Ejemplo 1. Considere una red de igual para compartir archivos. Cada vez que el Agente B carga un archivo del Agente A, todos los pares a lo largo de la ruta de enrutamiento saben que B ha cargado el archivo. Pueden registrar esta información sobre el Agente B. Además, pueden distribuir esta información. Sin embargo, es imposible registrar toda la información en todas partes. Primero, tal duplicación induce grandes costos. En segundo lugar, a medida que los agentes ingresan y salen dinámicamente desde la red, la información podría no estar siempre disponible. Por lo tanto, parece natural considerar entornos en los que la información se registra localmente, es decir, la información se registra en el vecindario más cercano con cierta probabilidad p.En este documento veremos que si la información está disponible con cierta probabilidad, esto nos permite implementar una gama más amplia de objetivos sociales. Como resultado, la cooperación se logra independientemente de la creencia de los agentes. Esto demuestra que en algunos contextos computacionales nuestro enfoque es mucho menos exigente que el enfoque bayesiano (eso supone que los tipos de jugadores se dibujan de acuerdo con alguna función de densidad de probabilidad identificada).1.1 Implementaciones en configuraciones de información completa En entornos de información completa, cada agente está informado sobre todos los demás. Es decir, cada agente observa su propia preferencia y las preferencias de todos los demás agentes. Sin embargo, ningún extraño puede observar esta información. Específicamente, ni el diseñador de mecanismo ni el tribunal. Se mostraron muchos resultados positivos para tales entornos posiblemente realistas. Para encuestas recientes, ver [25, 27, 18]. Moore y Repullo implementan una gran clase de objetivos sociales utilizando mecanismos secuenciales con un pequeño número de rondas [28]. El concepto que utilizaron son las implementaciones perfectas de subgame (SPE). El concepto de implementación SPE parece natural por las siguientes razones: los mecanismos diseñados generalmente tienen construcciones no artificiales y un pequeño espacio de estrategia. Como resultado, es sencillo que un jugador calcule su estrategia.1 Segundo, los mecanismos secuenciales evitan los movimientos simultáneos y, por lo tanto, pueden considerarse para las redes distribuidas. En tercer lugar, los mecanismos construidos a menudo están descentralizados (es decir, que carecen de una autoridad centralizada o diseñador) 1 Curiosamente, en la vida real, los jugadores no siempre usan sus estrategias perfectas del subjuego. Uno de esos casos ampliamente estudiados es el juego de ultimátum de 2 personas de negociación. En este juego simple, el proponente primero hace una oferta de cómo dividir una cierta suma conocida de dinero, y el respondedor está de acuerdo o se niega, en el último caso, ambos jugadores ganan cero. Sorprendentemente, los experimentos muestran que el respondedor a menudo rechaza la oferta sugerida, incluso si está limitado de cero y el juego se juega solo una vez (ver, por ejemplo, [38]).y equilibrado con presupuesto (es decir, transferencias siempre se suman hasta cero). Esto sucede esencialmente si hay al menos tres jugadores y un enlace de red directo entre dos agentes. Finalmente, Moore y Repullo observaron que realmente usan una suposición de información completa relajada: solo se requiere que para cada jugador exista solo otro jugador que esté informado sobre él.1.2 Implementaciones en configuraciones parcialmente informadas y nuestros resultados La suposición de información completa es realista para pequeños grupos de jugadores, pero no en general. En este artículo consideramos a los jugadores que están informados el uno al otro con cierta probabilidad. Más formalmente, decimos que el Agente B está informado sobre el Agente A, si B conoce el tipo de A con probabilidad p.Para tales entornos parcialmente informados, mostramos cómo usar el concepto de solución de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas. Demostramos este concepto a través de algunos ejemplos motivadores de que (i) parecen naturales en entornos distribuidos y (ii) no se pueden implementar en estrategias dominantes, incluso si hay un centro autorizado con una conexión directa con cada agente o incluso si los jugadores tienen dominios de parámetro único.1. Primero mostramos cómo las técnicas perfectas del subjuego de Moore y Repullo [28] pueden aplicarse a entornos informados P y ajustarse aún más al concepto de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas (para P).2. Luego sugerimos un método desafiante basado en certificados que sea más natural en entornos informados por P computarizados y diferente del introducido por Moore y Repullo [28] (para p ∈ (0, 1]). 3. Consideramos implementaciones en varias estructuras de red. Como estudio de caso, aplicamos nuestros métodos para derivar: (1) red de igual a igual simplificada para compartir archivos sin pagos en equilibrio. Nuestro enfoque es (agente, archivo)-específico.(2) Mecanismo presupuestario y económicamente eficiente de la Web-Cache. Nuestros mecanismos utilizan castigos razonables que dependen inversamente de p.Y así, si las multas son grandes, entonces la P pequeña es suficiente para inducir la cooperación. Esencialmente, la P grande implica una gran cantidad de información registrada.1.2.1 Agentes maliciosos Los mecanismos descentralizados a menudo utilizan resultados castigadores. Como resultado, los jugadores maliciosos pueden causar daños severos a los demás. Sugerimos una noción cuantificada de jugador malicioso, que se beneficia de su propio excedente ganado y de daños causados a los demás.[12] sugiere varias categorías para clasificar a los jugadores no cooperantes. Nuestro enfoque es similar a [7] (y las referencias allí), que consideraron independientemente a tales jugadores en un contexto diferente. Mostramos un mecanismo descentralizado simple en el que los jugadores Q-Malicious cooperan y, en particular, no usan sus acciones de castigo en equilibrio.241 1.3 Implementaciones de la estrategia dominante En esta subsección, nos referiremos a algunos resultados recientes que demuestren que la configuración de información privada con el concepto de estrategias dominantes es restrictiva en general. Primero, el resultado de imposibilidad clásica de Roberts muestra que si las preferencias de los jugadores no están restringidas y hay al menos 3 resultados diferentes, entonces cada mecanismo de estrategia dominante debe ser ponderado VCG (con el objetivo social que maximiza el bienestar ponderado) [35]. Para dominios de preferencia ligeramente restringidos, no se sabe cómo convertir algoritmos eficientemente computables en mecanismos de estrategia dominantes. Esto fue observado y analizado en [32, 22, 31]. Recientemente [20] extiende el resultado de Roberts a algunos ejemplos principales. Mostraron que bajo suposiciones leves, cualquier mecanismo de estrategia dominante para la variedad de subastas combinatorias sobre dominios multidimensionales debe ser casi ponderado VCG. Además, resulta que el requisito de estrategia dominante implica que el objetivo social debe ser monótono [35, 36, 22, 20, 5, 37]. Esta condición es muy restrictiva, ya que muchos objetivos naturales deseados no son monótonos2. Varios documentos recientes consideran relajaciones del concepto de estrategia dominante: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21]. Sin embargo, la mayoría de estos resultados positivos se aplican a casos severamente restringidos (por ejemplo, parámetro único, 2 jugadores) o equivalen a mecanismos VCG o casi VCG (por ejemplo, [19]). Recientemente, [8, 3] consideraron implementaciones para jugadores de parámetros únicos generalizados. Organización de este documento: en la Sección 2 ilustramos los conceptos de la eliminación del subjuego perfecta e iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas en entornos completamente informados y parcialmente informados. En la Sección 3 mostramos un mecanismo para las redes de intercambio de archivos entre pares. En la Sección 4 aplicamos nuestros métodos para obtener un mecanismo de caché web. El trabajo futuro se discute brevemente en la Sección 5. 2. Ejemplos motivadores en esta sección Examinamos los conceptos de la eliminación de subjuego perfecta e iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas para entornos completamente informados y informados P. También presentamos la noción de Q-malicia y algunas otras consideraciones relacionadas a través de dos ejemplos ilustrativos.2.1 El problema de asignación justa Nuestro primer ejemplo es un ajuste al contexto computarizado de un procedimiento antiguo para garantizar que el hombre más rico de Atenas patrocine una producción teatral conocida como Choregia [27]. En el problema de asignación justa, Alice y Bob son dos trabajadores, y hay una nueva tarea que se debe realizar. Su objetivo es asignar la tarea al trabajador menos cargado sin transferencias monetarias. La suposición informativa es que Alice y Bob conocen las cargas y la duración de la nueva tarea.3 2, por ejemplo, minimizando el MakePan dentro de un factor de 2 [32] y Rawls gobiernan sobre algunos dominios multidimensionales [20].3 A primera vista, uno podría preguntar por qué los agentes completamente informados no podrían simplemente firmar un contrato, especificando el objetivo deseado. Tal contrato a veces es inviable debido al hecho de que el verdadero estado no puede ser observado por los extraños, especialmente no por el tribunal. Reclamación 1. El objetivo de asignación justa no se puede implementar en estrategias dominantes. 4 2.1.1 Mecanismo básico El siguiente mecanismo simple implementa este objetivo en el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego.• Etapa 1: Alice acepta realizar la nueva tarea o se niega.• Etapa 2: si ella se niega, Bob tiene que elegir entre: - (a) Realizar la tarea él mismo.- (b) intercambiar su carga con Alice y realizar la nueva tarea también. Deje que Lt A, Lt B sea las verdaderas cargas de Alice y Bob, y sea T> 0 la carga de la nueva tarea. Suponga que el intercambio de carga lleva cero tiempo y costo. Veremos que el mecanismo básico logra el objetivo en un equilibrio perfecto del subjuego. Intuitivamente esto significa que en equilibrio, cada jugador elegirá su mejor acción en cada punto que pueda alcanzar, asumiendo un comportamiento similar de los demás, y por lo tanto cada SPE es un equilibrio de Nash. Reclamación 2. ([27]) La tarea se asigna al trabajador menos cargado en el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego. Prueba. Por argumento de inducción hacia atrás (mira hacia adelante y razonan hacia atrás), considere los siguientes casos: 1. Lt B ≤ Lt A. Si se alcanza la etapa 2, Bob no intercambiará.2. Lt a <lt b <lt a + t.Si se alcanza la etapa 2, Bob intercambiará, y esto es lo que Alice prefiere.3. Lt a + t ≤ Lt B. Si se alcanza la etapa 2, entonces Bob intercambiaría, como resultado, Alice es estrictamente preferible realizar la tarea. Tenga en cuenta que el mecanismo básico no utiliza transferencias monetarias y está descentralizada en el sentido de que no se necesita un tercero para ejecutar el procedimiento. El objetivo se logra en equilibrio (los lazos se rompen a favor de Alice). Sin embargo, en el segundo cambio de caso ocurre en un punto de equilibrio. Recuerde la suposición poco realista de que el intercambio de carga lleva cero tiempo y costo. Al introducir multas, el siguiente mecanismo supera este inconveniente.2.1.2 Mecanismo de obtención En esta subsección veremos un mecanismo centralizado para el objetivo de asignación justa sin intercambio de carga en equilibrio. Los supuestos adicionales son los siguientes. El costo que realiza una carga de duración d es exactamente d.Suponemos que la duración T de la nueva tarea es <T. Los pagos 4 Prueba: Suponga que existe un mecanismo que implementa este objetivo en estrategias dominantes. Luego, por el principio de revelación [23], existe un mecanismo que implementa este objetivo para el cual la estrategia dominante de cada jugador es informar su verdadera carga. Claramente, los informes sinceramente no pueden ser una estrategia dominante para este objetivo (si las transferencias monetarias no están disponibles), ya que los jugadores preferirían informar cargas más altas.242 de los agentes de maximizadores de servicios públicos son cuasilineales. El siguiente mecanismo es una adaptación del mecanismo de obtención de Moore y Repulos [28] 5.• Etapa 1: (Poner la carga de Alices) Alice anuncia la. Bob anuncia la ≤ la. Si La = La (Bob está de acuerdo) en la siguiente etapa. De lo contrario (Bob desafía), Alice se le asigna la tarea. Luego tiene que elegir entre: - (a) Transferir su carga original a Bob y pagarlo la - 0.5 · min {, la - la}. Alice paga al mecanismo. Bob paga la multa de T + al mecanismo.- (b) Sin transferencia de carga. Alice paga a Bob. DETENER.• Etapa 2: La obtención de la carga de Bobs es similar a la etapa 1 (cambiando los roles de Alice y Bob).• Etapa 3: si la <lb Alice se le asigna la tarea, de lo contrario Bob. DETENER. Observe que a Alice se le asigna la tarea y se mide cada vez que Bob desafía. Veremos que la bonificación de se paga a un jugador desafiante solo en casos de equilibrio. Reclamación 3. Si el mecanismo se detiene en la Etapa 3, entonces la recompensa de cada agente es al menos −T y como máximo 0. Proposición 1. Es un equilibrio perfecto del mecanismo de obtención del subjuego del mecanismo de obtención para informar la carga verdadera y desafiar con la carga verdadera solo si el otro agente se reporta exagerados. Prueba. Suponga W.L.O.G que la obtención de la carga de Alices se realiza después de Bobs, y que se alcanza la Etapa 2. Si Alice realmente informa La = Lt A, Bob prefiere estar de acuerdo. De lo contrario, si Bob desafía, Alice siempre preferiría transferir (como en este caso Bob realizaría su carga por un costo menor), como resultado, Bob pagaría T + al mecanismo. Este resultado castigador es menos preferible que el resultado normal de la etapa 3 alcanzada si hubiera estado de acuerdo. Si Alice incorpora mal la> lt a, entonces Bob puede asegurarse de la bonificación (que siempre es estrictamente preferible que llegar a la Etapa 3) desafiando con La = Lt A, y así que cada vez que Bob obtiene el bono que Alice gana la peor de todas las recompensas. Informar una carga más baja la <lt A no es beneficioso para Alice. En este caso, Bob preferiría estrictamente estar de acuerdo (y no anunciar la <la, ya que él se limitó al desafío con una carga más pequeña de lo que ella anuncia). Por lo tanto, tal información errónea solo puede aumentar la posibilidad de que se le asigne la tarea. Y entonces no hay incentivo para que Alice lo haga. En conjunto, Alice preferiría informar la verdad en esta etapa. Y así, la etapa 2 no terminaría anormalmente por parada, y de manera similar la etapa 1. Observe que el mecanismo de obtención está casi equilibrado: en todos los resultados, no entra ni dinero, excepto por el resultado sin equilibrio (a), en el que ambos jugadores pagan al mecanismo.5 en [28], si un agente mal informar su tipo, entonces siempre es beneficioso para el otro agente desafiar. En particular, incluso si el agente informa una carga más baja.2.1.3 Mecanismo de obtención para agentes parcialmente informados en esta subsección Consideramos agentes parcialmente informados. Formalmente: Definición 1. Un agente A está informado sobre el Agente B, si A conoce el tipo de B con probabilidad P (independientemente de lo que B sabe)). Resulta que una versión del mecanismo de obtención funciona para esta suposición de información relajada, si utilizamos el concepto de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas6. Reemplazamos la multa fija de en el mecanismo de obtención con la multa: βp = max {l, 1 - p 2p - 1 t} +, y asumimos los límites lt a, lt b ≤ l. proposición 2. Si todos los agentes están informados P> 0.5, el mecanismo de obtención (βp) implementa el objetivo de asignación justa con el concepto de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas. La estrategia de cada jugador es informar la verdadera carga y desafiar con la carga verdadera si el otro agente se destaca exagerarse. Prueba. Suponga W.L.O.G que la obtención de la carga de Alices se realiza después de Bobs, y que se alcanza la Etapa 2. Primero observa que subraperar el valor verdadero es una estrategia dominada, ya sea que BOB no esté informado y desafíe erróneamente con una carga más baja (como βP ≥ L) o no, o incluso si T es muy pequeño. Ahora veremos que la información excesiva de su valor es una estrategia dominada también. Los alices esperan el pago ganado por informes erróneos ≤ P (Recompensa si se encuentra y se informa a Bob) + (1 - P) (Pago máximo si Bob no está informado) ≤ P (−T - βP) <P (−T) + (1 (1- P) (−T - βP) ≤ P (recompensa mínima del informe verdadero Si Bob está informado) + (1 - P) (Recompensa mínima Si Bob no está informado) ≤ Alices de recompensa esperada si realmente informa. El término (−T - βp) en el lado izquierdo se debe al hecho de que si Bob está informado, siempre preferirá desafiar. En el lado derecho, si está informado, entonces el desafío es una estrategia dominada, y si no está informado, el peor daño que puede hacer es desafiar. Así, en la etapa 2, Alice informará su verdadera carga. Esto implica que desafiar sin estar informado es una estrategia dominada para Bob. Este argumento puede razonarse también para la primera etapa, cuando Bob informa su valor. Bob sabe que la recompensa máxima que puede obtener es como máximo cero, ya que no puede esperar obtener el bono en la siguiente etapa.2.1.4 Extensiones El mecanismo de obtención para agentes parcialmente informados es bastante general. Al igual que en [28], necesitamos la capacidad de juzgar entre dos declaraciones distintas en las rondas de obtención, 6 una estrategia SI del jugador I está débilmente dominado si existe un SI tal que (i) la recompensa ganada por SI es al menos tan altaComo la recompensa obtenida por SI, para todas las estrategias de los otros jugadores y todas las preferencias, y (ii) existe una preferencia y una combinación de estrategias para los otros jugadores, de modo que la recompensa obtenida por Si es estrictamente más alta que la recompensa ganada porsi.243 y límites superiores e inferiores basados en los posibles pagos derivados de la última etapa. Además, para los entornos informados P, se necesitan alguna estructura para garantizar que la subestimación sea una estrategia dominada. Los mecanismos de tipo Choregia se pueden aplicar a más de 2 jugadores con el mismo número de etapas: el jugador en la primera etapa puede simplemente señalar el nombre del agente más rico. Del mismo modo, los mecanismos de obtención se pueden extender de manera directa. Estos mecanismos pueden estar equilibrados con el presupuesto, ya que algún jugador podría reemplazar el papel del diseñador y recolectar las multas, como se observa en [28]. Problema abierto 1. Diseñe un mecanismo equilibrado presupuestario descentralizado con multas razonables para N jugadores de N informados de P independientemente, donde P ≤ 1-1/2 1 N-1.2.2 Escenario del vendedor y comprador Un jugador puede causar daños severos a los demás al elegir un resultado que no sea de equilibrio. En el mecanismo para el objetivo de asignación justa, un agente podría desafiar maliciosamente incluso si el otro agente realmente informa su carga. En esta subsección consideramos tales escenarios maliciosos. Para la facilidad de exposición presentamos un segundo ejemplo. Demostramos que los equilibrios permanecen sin cambios incluso si los jugadores son maliciosos. En el ejemplo del vendedor-comprador, hay un artículo que se negociará y dos posibles estados futuros. El objetivo es vender el artículo por el precio promedio de bajo precio PL = LS+LB 2 en el estado L, y el precio más alto pH = HS+HB 2 en el otro estado H, donde LS es el costo de los vendedores y LB es el valor de los compradores en el estado del estadoL, y de manera similar HS, HB en H. Los jugadores arreglan los precios sin saber cuál será el estado futuro. Suponga que ls <hs <lb <hb, y que el comercio puede ocurrir en ambos precios (es decir, pl, ph ∈ (hs, lb)). Solo los jugadores pueden observar la realización del verdadero estado. Los pagos son de la forma ub = xv - tb, us = ts −xvs, donde la variable binaria x indica si se produjo el comercio, y TB, TS son las transferencias. Considere el siguiente mecanismo comercial descentralizado.• Etapa 1: si el vendedor informa h geto en etapa 2. De lo contrario, cotice a bajo precio PL. DETENER.• Etapa 2: el comprador tiene que elegir entre: - (a) Comercio al alto precio pH.- (b) Ningún comercio y el vendedor paga ∆ al comprador. Reclamación 4. Sea ∆ = lb - ph+. El equilibrio perfecto del subjuego perfecto del mecanismo comercial es informar el verdadero estado en la etapa 1 y el comercio si se alcanza la etapa 2. Tenga en cuenta que el resultado (b) nunca se elige en equilibrio.2.2.1 Mecanismo comercial para agentes maliciosos El comprador podría castigar maliciosamente al vendedor eligiendo el resultado (b) cuando el verdadero estado es H. La siguiente noción cuantifica la consideración de que un jugador no es indiferente a los excedentes privados de otros. Definición 2. Un jugador es Q-malicioso si su pago es igual a: (1-Q) (su excedente privado)-Q (suma de otros excedentes), q ∈ [0, 1]. Esta definición apareció independientemente en [7] en un contexto diferente. Veremos que los comerciantes evitarían un comportamiento tan malo si son Q-maliciosos, donde Q <0.5, es decir, si su impacto de no indiferencia está limitado en 0.5. Los resultados de los equilibrios permanecen sin cambios, por lo que se logra la cooperación como en el caso original de jugadores no maliciosos. Considere el mecanismo de comercio con Pl = (1 - Q) HS + Q Lb, pH = Q HS + (1 - Q) Lb, ∆ = (1 - Q) (Hb - Lb -). Tenga en cuenta que PL <pH para Q <0.5. Reclamación 5. Si q <0.5, entonces el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego único para los jugadores Q-maliciosos permanece sin cambios. Prueba. Por inducción hacia atrás consideramos dos casos. En el estado H, el comprador Q-Malicious preferiría negociar si (1-Q) (Hb-pH) + Q (HS-pH)> (1-Q) ∆ + Q (∆). De hecho, (1 - Q) Hb + QHS> ∆ + PH. Trivialmente, el vendedor prefiere comerciar a un precio más alto, (1 - Q) (PL - HS) + Q (PL - Hb) <(1 - Q) (pH - HS) + Q (pH - Hb). En el estado l, el comprador prefiere el resultado no comercial, como (1 - Q) (lb −ph)+Q (ls -ph) <∆. El vendedor prefiere operar a un precio bajo, como (1 - Q) (PL - LS) + Q (PL - lb)> 0> −∆.2.2.2 DISCUSIÓN Ningún mecanismo puede implementar este objetivo comercial si los únicos resultados posibles son el comercio en PL y el comercio a pH. Para ver esto, es suficiente considerar las formas normales (ya que cualquier mecanismo de forma extensa puede presentarse como normal). Considere una representación de matriz, donde el vendedor es el reproductor de filas y el comprador es el reproductor de columnas, en el que cada entrada incluye un resultado. Supongamos que hay una entrada de equilibrio para el estado L. La columna asociada debe ser todo PL, de lo contrario, el vendedor tendría un incentivo para desviarse. Del mismo modo, la fila asociada de la entrada de equilibrio H debe ser todo pH (de lo contrario, el comprador se desviaría), una contradicción.7 8 El comprador prefiere PL y el pH del vendedor, por lo que las preferencias son idénticas en ambos estados. Por lo tanto, informar las preferencias sobre los resultados no es suficiente: los jugadores deben proporcionar información adicional. Esto es capturado por el resultado (b) en el mecanismo comercial. Intuitivamente, si un objetivo no es implementación de Nash, necesitamos agregar más resultados. El inconveniente es que se deben descartar algunos nuevos equilibrios adicionales. Por ejemplo, el equilibrio de NASH adicional para el mecanismo comercial es (comercio en PL, (b)). Es decir, el vendedor elige comerciar a un precio bajo en cualquiera de los estados, y el comprador siempre elige la opción de no comercial que multiplica al vendedor, si se alcanza la segunda etapa. Dicha amenaza de compradores no es creíble, porque si el mecanismo se juega solo una vez, y la etapa 2 se alcanza en el Estado H, el comprador disminuiría estrictamente su recompensa si él elige (b). Claramente, este no es un equilibrio perfecto del subjuego perfecto. Aunque cada forma extensa del juego es estratégicamente equivalente a una forma normal normal, la representación extensa de la forma coloca más estructura y, por lo tanto, parece plausible que se juegue el equilibrio perfecto del subjuego.9 7 Formalmente, este objetivo no es más enmascarado, una condición necesariapara la implementabilidad de Nash [24].8 Un argumento similar se aplica para el problema de asignación justa.9 Curiosamente, es sencillo construir un mecanismo secuencial con SPE único y NE adicional con una recompensa estrictamente más grande para cada jugador.244 3. Redes entre pares En esta sección describimos una red de pares simplificada para compartir archivos, sin pagos en equilibrio, utilizando un método desafiante basado en certificados. En este método desafiante, a diferencia de [28], un agente que los desafíos no pueden dañar a otros agentes, a menos que proporcione un certificado válido. En general, si el Agente B copió un archivo F del Agente A, entonces el Agente A sabe que el Agente B contiene una copia del archivo. Denotamos dicha información como un certificado (b, f) (omitiremos los detalles criptográficos). Dicho certificado se puede registrar y distribuir a lo largo de la red, por lo que podemos tratar a cada agente que mantenga el certificado como agente informado. Suposiciones: Asumimos un sistema homogéneo con archivos de igual tamaño. El beneficio de cada agente gana al mantener una copia de cualquier archivo es v. El único costo que tiene cada agente es el costo de carga C (inducido al transferir un archivo a un vecino inmediato). Todos los demás costos son insignificantes (por ejemplo, almacenar los certificados, reenviar mensajes, proporcionar reconocimientos, firmas digitales, etc.). Deja que UPA, Downa sea el número de agentes A y descarga si siempre coopera. Suponemos que cada agente A ingresa al sistema si upa · c <downa · v. Cada agente tiene una utilidad cuasilínea y solo se preocupa por su uso actual de ancho de banda. En particular, ignora los escenarios futuros (por ejemplo, ya sea reenviar o soltar un paquete podría afectar la demanda futura).3.1 Mecanismo básico Comenzamos con un mecanismo para una red con 3 agentes informados P: B, A1, A2. Suponemos que B está directamente conectado a A1 y A2. Si B tiene el certificado (A1, F), entonces puede solicitar directamente a A1 y solicitar el archivo (si se niega, entonces B puede ir a la corte). El siguiente mecanismo secuencial básico es aplicable cuando el Agente B no está informado y aún desea descargar el archivo si existe en la red. Tenga en cuenta que este objetivo no se puede implementar en estrategias dominantes sin pagos (similar a la reclamación 1, cuando el tipo de cada agente aquí es el conjunto de archivos que posee). Definir TA, B como la cantidad monetaria que el agente A debe transferir a B. • Etapa 1: el agente B solicita el archivo F de A1.- Si A1 responde que sí, B descarga el archivo de A1. DETENER.- De lo contrario, el Agente B envía A1 sin respuesta al Agente A2.∗ Si A2 declara de acuerdo, entonces gire la siguiente etapa.∗ más, A2 envía un certificado (A1, F) al Agente B. · Si el certificado es correcto, entonces Ta1, A2 = βP. DETENER.· Else Ta2, a1 = | c |+. DETENER. Etapa 2: el agente B solicita el archivo F de A2. Cambie los roles de los agentes A1, A2. Reclamación 6. El mecanismo básico es equilibrado con el presupuesto (transfiere siempre suma a cero) y descentralizado. Teorema 1. Sea βp = | c |p +, p ∈ (0, 1]. Una estrategia que sobrevive a la eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas es responder sí si AI contiene el archivo y cuestionar solo con un certificado válido. Como resultado, B descarga el archivo si algún agente lo contiene, en equilibrio. No hay pagos ni transferencias en equilibrio. Prueba. Claramente si el mecanismo termina sin desafiar: −c ≤ u (ai) ≤ 0. Y así, desafiar con un certificado inválido es siempre una estrategia dominada. Ahora, cuando se alcanza la etapa 2, A2 es el último en informar si tiene el archivo. Si A2 tiene el archivo, es una estrategia débilmente desanimada para informar mal, ya sea que A1 esté informado o no: el pago esperado de A2 se obtiene al informar mal no ≤ P · (−βP) + (1 - P) · 0 <−C ≤ A2S Pagado siElla informa que sí. Este argumento puede razonarse también para la Etapa 1, cuando A1 informa si tiene el archivo. A1 sabe que A2 informará que sí si y solo si ella tiene el archivo en la siguiente etapa, por lo que la recompensa máxima que puede obtener es como máximo cero ya que no puede esperar obtener una bonificación.3.2 Redes de cadena En una red de cadena, el agente B está directamente conectado a A1, y la IA está directamente conectada al Agente AI+1. Suponga que tenemos un protocolo de reconocimiento para confirmar la recepción de un mensaje en particular. Para evitar la caída de mensajes, agregamos la multa (βp +2) a pagar un agente que no ha reenviado correctamente un mensaje. El mecanismo de la cadena sigue: • Etapa I: el Agente B reenvía una solicitud para el archivo F a Ai (a través de {ak} k≤i).• Si AI informa que sí, entonces B descarga F de AI. DETENER.• De lo contrario, AI informa no. Si AJ envía un certificado (AK, F) a B, (J, K ≤ I), entonces - Si el certificado (AK, F) es correcto, entonces T (AK, AJ) = βP. DETENER.- Else, T (AJ, Ak) = C +. DETENER. Si AI informa que no tiene copia del archivo, entonces cualquier agente intermedio podría desafiar. Utilizando firmas digitales y reconocimientos, observe que cada agente debe reenviar cada mensaje, incluso si contiene un certificado que muestra que él mismo ha informado mal. Usamos la misma multa, βP, como en el mecanismo básico, porque el protocolo podría terminar en la etapa 1 (claramente, el análisis anterior aún se aplica, ya que la P real aumenta con el número de jugadores).3.3 Mecanismo de red En esta subsección consideramos estructuras de red generales. Necesitamos la suposición de que hay un protocolo de ping que verifica si un agente vecino está en línea o no (es decir, un agente en línea no puede esconderse). Para limitar la cantidad de información que se registrará, suponemos que un agente está comprometido a mantener cualquier archivo descargado a al menos una hora, por lo que los certificados son válidos por un período de tiempo limitado. Suponemos que cada agente tiene una lista firmada digitalmente de sus vecinos inmediatos actuales. Al igual que en las aplicaciones de intercambio de archivos P2P reales, restringimos cada solicitud de reenviar un archivo como máximo R (es decir, las descargas son posibles solo dentro de un vecindario de Radius R).245 El mecanismo de red utiliza el mecanismo de cadena de la siguiente manera: cuando el agente B solicita un archivo del agente A (como máximo r - 1 lejos), A envía a B la lista de sus vecinos y la salida del protocolo de ping a todosde estos vecinos. Como resultado, B puede explorar la red. Observación: En este mecanismo asumimos que el entorno está informado P. Un problema de diseño importante que no se aborda aquí son los incentivos para la fase de propagación de información.4. Los caché web de caché web son una herramienta ampliamente utilizada para mejorar la eficiencia general del sistema al permitir un acceso local rápido. Fueron enumerados en [12] como una aplicación desafiante del diseño de mecanismo algorítmico distribuido. Nisan [30] consideró un solo caché compartido por agentes estratégicos. En este problema, el agente I gana el valor VT I si un elemento en particular se carga en el caché compartido local. El objetivo eficiente es cargar el elemento si y solo si σvt i ≥ c, donde c es el costo de carga. Este objetivo se reduce al problema del proyecto público analizado por Clarke [10]. Sin embargo, es bien sabido que este mecanismo no está equilibrado con el presupuesto (por ejemplo, si la valoración de cada jugador es C, entonces todos pagan cero). En esta sección, sugerimos suposiciones informativas y ambientales para los cuales describimos un mecanismo eficiente de depentralización depentralizada. Consideramos entornos para los cuales la demanda futura de cada agente depende de la demanda pasada. Los requisitos informativos y ambientales subyacentes son los siguientes.1. Un agente puede leer el contenido de un mensaje solo si él es el nodo objetivo (incluso si tiene que reenviar el mensaje como un nodo intermedio de alguna ruta de enrutamiento). Un agente no puede iniciar un mensaje en nombre de otros agentes.2. Hay un protocolo de reconocimiento disponible, para que cada agente pueda proporcionar un certificado que indique que manejó un determinado mensaje correctamente.3. Costos insignificantes: asumimos que los agentes informados P, donde P es tal que los agentes inducidos por el costo para mantener registros de información son insignificantes. También suponemos que el costo incurrido por envío y reenvío de mensajes es insignificante.4. Deje que Qi (t) denote el número de solicitudes de carga agente que inicié para el artículo durante la ranura de tiempo t.Suponemos que VT I (t), el valor para almacenar en caché el elemento al comienzo de la ranura T depende solo de la ranura más reciente, formalmente vt i (t) = max {vi (qi (t - 1)), c},,donde vi (·) es una función real no dreible. Además, VI (·) es un conocimiento común entre los jugadores.5. La red es homogénea en el sentido de que si el agente j maneja las solicitudes K iniciadas por el agente I durante la ranura de tiempo, entonces Qi (t) = kα, donde α depende del protocolo de enrutamiento y el entorno (α podría ser más pequeño que1, si cada solicitud se inunda varias veces). Suponemos que la única forma en que puedo afectar el verdadero Qi (t) es al aumentar superficialmente su demanda del artículo almacenado en caché, pero no la otra forma (es decir, pérdida de agentes, incurrido al renunciar a una solicitud necesaria para el artículo,no es insignificante). El primer requisito es evitar la conducción libre, y también evitar el caso de que un agente aumente superficialmente la demanda de los demás y, como resultado, disminuye su propia demanda. El segundo requisito es evitar el caso de que un agente que reciba una solicitud de enrutamiento para el artículo, lo registra y luego lo deja caer. El tercero es asegurarse de que el medio ambiente permanezca bien informado. Además, si el costo de reenvío es insignificante, cada agente coopera y reenvía mensajes, ya que no le gustaría disminuir la demanda futura (que depende monotónicamente de la ranura de tiempo actual, como se supone en el requisito de Forth) de otro agente. Dado que los pagos están aumentando con los valores declarados, los requisitos Forth y Fifth aseguran que el agente no aumente su demanda superficialmente y, por lo tanto, Qi (t) es la verdadera demanda. El siguiente mecanismo de cálculo web implementa el objetivo eficiente que comparte el costo proporcionalmente. Por simplicidad, se describe para dos jugadores y w.l.o.g vt i (t) es igual al número de solicitudes iniciadas por I y observadas por cualquier j (es decir, α = 1 y VI (qi (t - 1)) = qi (t (t- 1)).• Etapa 1: (Plealización de VT A (t)) Alice anuncia VA.Bob anuncia VA ≥ VA. Si va = VA goto la siguiente etapa. De lo contrario (Bob desafía): - Si BOB proporciona registros válidos de VA, entonces Alice paga C para financiar la carga del artículo en el caché. Ella también paga βp a Bob. DETENER.- De lo contrario, Bob financia la carga del artículo en el caché. DETENER.• Etapa 2: la obtención de VT B (t) se realiza de manera análoga.• Etapa 3: si VA + VB <c, entonces deténgase. De lo contrario, cargue el artículo en el caché, Alice paga PA = VA VA+VB · C, y Bob paga PB = VB VA+VB · C. Reclamación 7. Es una estrategia dominada para informar sobre el valor verdadero. Prueba. Deje que VT a <VA. Hay dos casos a considerar: • Si VT A + Vb <C y VA + VB ≥ C. Necesitamos demostrar que si el mecanismo se detiene normalmente, Alice pagaría más que VT A, es decir: VA VA + VB · C>VT A. De hecho, VA C> VA (VT A + VB)> VT A (VA + VB).• Si VT A +VB ≥ C, entonces claramente, VA VA +VB> VT A VT A +VB. Teorema 2. Sea βp = max {0, 1−2p p · c} +, p ∈ (0, 1]. Una estrategia que sobrevive a la eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas es informar la verdad y desafiar solo cuando el agente está informado. El mecanismo es eficiente, equilibrado con presupuesto, exhibe soberanía del consumidor, sin transferencia positiva y racionalidad individual10. Prueba. Desafiar sin estar informado (es decir, sin proporcionar suficientes registros válidos) siempre es una estrategia dominada en este mecanismo. Ahora, suponga W.L.O.G. Alice es 10 ver [29] o [12] para definiciones exactas.246 el último en informar su valor. Los alices esperan el pago ganado por subregistro ≤ p · (−c - βp) + (1 - p) · c <p · 0 + (1 - p) · 0 ≤ alices de recaudación esperada si ella informa honestamente. El lado derecho es igual a cero ya que los costos de participación son insignificantes. Razonando, Bob no puede esperar obtener el bono, por lo que informar mal es una estrategia dominada para él.5. Observaciones finales En este documento hemos visto una nueva suposición informativa parcial, y hemos demostrado su idoneidad a las redes en las que los agentes computacionales pueden recopilar y distribuir fácilmente información. Luego describimos algunos mecanismos utilizando el concepto de eliminación iterativa de estrategias débilmente dominadas. Algunos problemas para el trabajo futuro incluyen: • Como hemos visto, el problema de implementación en los entornos informados P es sencillo: es fácil construir mecanismos compatibles con incentivos incluso para casos no parámetros. El desafío es encontrar escenarios más realistas en los que se aplique la suposición informativa parcial.• Mecanismos para la propagación y mantenimiento de la información. En nuestros ejemplos elegimos P de manera que el costo de mantenimiento con el tiempo sea insignificante. Sin embargo, la dinámica del caso general es delicada: un agente puede usar la información registrada para eliminar los datos que probablemente no sean necesarios para disminuir sus costos de mantenimiento. Como resultado, la probabilidad de que el medio ambiente esté informado disminuya y los agentes egoístas no cooperarían. Los incentivos para la propagación de información también deben considerarse (por ejemplo, para las redes P2P para compartir archivos).• Parece que algunos objetivos de elección social no se pueden implementar si cada jugador es al menos 1/N-malicioso (donde n es el número de jugadores). Sería interesante identificar estos casos.

In this paper we shall see that if the information is available with some probability, then this enables us to implement a wider range of social goals.",

        "Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies.",

        "In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero.",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",

        "In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.",

        "First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].",
        "For slightly-restricted preference domains, it is not known how to turn efficiently computable algorithms into dominant strategy mechanisms.",
        "This was observed and analyzed in [32, 22, 31].",
        "Recently [20] extends Roberts result to some leading examples.",
        "They showed that under mild assumptions any dominant strategy mechanism for variety of Combinatorial Auctions over multi-dimensional domains must be almost weighted VCG.",
        "Additionally, it turns out that the dominant strategy requirement implies that the social goal must be monotone [35, 36, 22, 20, 5, 37].",
        "This condition is very restrictive, as many desired natural goals are non-monotone2 .",
        "Several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant strategy concept: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21].",
        "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",

        "This punishing outcome is less preferable than the normal outcome of Stage 3 achieved had he agreed.",
        "If Alice misreports LA > LT A, then Bob can ensure himself the bonus (which is always strictly preferable than reaching Stage 3) by challenging with LA = LT A, and so whenever Bob gets the bonus Alice gains the worst of all payoffs.",
        "Reporting a lower load LA < LT A is not beneficial for Alice.",
        "In this case, Bob would strictly prefer to agree (and not to announce LA < LA, as he limited to challenge with a smaller load than what she announces).",

        "As in [28], we need the capability to judge between two distinct declarations in the elicitation rounds, 6 A strategy si of player i is weakly dominated if there exists si such that (i) the payoff gained by si is at least as high as the payoff gained by si, for all strategies of the other players and all preferences, and (ii) there exist a preference and a combination of strategies for the other players such that the payoff gained by si is strictly higher than the payoff gained by si. 243 and upper and lower bounds based on the possible payoffs derived from the last stage.",

        "The seller prefers to trade at a low price, as (1 − q)(pl − ls) + q(pl − lb) > 0 > −∆. 2.2.2 Discussion No mechanism can Nash-implement this trading goal if the only possible outcomes are trade at pl and trade at ph.",
        "To see this, it is enough to consider normal forms (as any extensive form mechanism can be presented as a normal one).",
        "Consider a matrix representation, where the seller is the row player and the buyer is the column player, in which every entry includes an outcome.",
        "Suppose there is equilibrium entry for the state L. The associate column must be all pl, otherwise the seller would have an incentive to deviate.",
        "Similarly, the associate row of the H equilibrium entry must be all ph (otherwise the buyer would deviate), a contradiction. 7 8 The buyer prefers pl and seller ph, and so the preferences are identical in both states.",
        "Hence reporting preferences over outcomes is not enough - players must supply additional information.",
        "This is captured by outcome (b) in the trade mechanism.",
        "Intuitively, if a goal is not Nash-implementable we need to add more outcomes.",
        "The drawback is that some new additional equilibria must be ruled out.",
        "E.g., additional Nash equilibrium for the trade mechanism is (trade at pl, (b)).",
        "That is, the seller chooses to trade at low price at either states, and the buyer always chooses the no trade option that fines the seller, if the second stage is reached.",
        "Such buyers threat is not credible, because if the mechanism is played only once, and Stage 2 is reached in state H, the buyer would strictly decrease his payoff if he chooses (b).",
        "Clearly, this is not a subgame perfect equilibrium.",
        "Although each extensive game-form is strategically equivalent to a normal form one, the extensive form representation places more structure and so it seems plausible that the subgame perfect equilibrium will be played.9 7 Formally, this goal is not Maskin monotonic, a necessary condition for Nash-implementability [24]. 8 A similar argument applies for the Fair Assignment Problem. 9 Interestingly, it is a straight forward to construct a sequential mechanism with unique SPE, and additional NE with a strictly larger payoff for every player. 244 3.",

        "As in real P2P file sharing applications, we restrict each request for a file to be forwarded at most r times (that is, downloads are possible only inside a neighborhood of radius r). 245 The network mechanism utilizes the chain mechanism in the following way: When agent B requests a file from agent A (at most r − 1 far), then A sends to B the list of his neighbors and the output of the ping protocol to all of these neighbors.",
        "As a result, B can explore the network.",
        "Remark: In this mechanism we assumed that the environment is p-informed.",

        "We assume that the only way agent i can affect the true qi(t) is by superficially increasing his demand for the cached item, but not the other way (that is, agents loss, incurred by giving up a necessary request for the item, is not negligible).",
        "The first requirement is to avoid free riding, and also to avoid the case that an agent superficially increases the demand of others and as a result decreases his own demand.",
        "The second requirement is to avoid the case that an agent who gets a routing request for the item, records it and then drops it.",

        "Challenging without being informed (that is, without providing enough valid records) is always dominated strategy in this mechanism.",

        "We then described some mechanisms using the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.",

        "In our examples we choose p such that the maintenance cost over time is negligible.",
        "However, the dynamics of the general case is delicate: an agent can use the recorded information to eliminate data that is not likely to be needed, in order to decrease his maintenance costs.",
        "As a result, the probability that the environment is informed decreases, and selfish agents would not cooperate.",
        "Incentives for information propagation should be considered as well (e.g., for P2P networks for file sharing). • It seems that some social choice goals cannot be implemented if each player is at least 1/n-malicious (where n is the number of players).",

                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",

                "Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies.",

                "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",
                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",
                "Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him. 1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.",
                "In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.",
                "More formally, we say that agent B is p-informed about agent A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.",

                "We first show how the subgame perfect techniques of Moore and Repullo [28] can be applied to p-informed environments and further adjusted to the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (for large enough p). 2.",
                "We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3.",

                "We suggest a quantified notion of malicious player, who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm caused to others. [12] suggests several categories to classify non-cooperating players.",

                "We show a simple decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and in particular, do not use their punishing actions in equilibrium. 241 1.3 Dominant Strategy Implementations In this subsection we shall refer to some recent results demonstrating that the set-up of private information with the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general.",
                "First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].",

                "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",

                "Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies.",
                "One such widely studied case is the Ultimatum Bargaining 2-person game.",
                "In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero.",
                "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",
                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",
                "Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him. 1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.",
                "In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.",
                "More formally, we say that agent B is p-informed about agent A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.",

                "We first show how the subgame perfect techniques of Moore and Repullo [28] can be applied to p-informed environments and further adjusted to the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (for large enough p). 2.",
                "We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3.",

                "Essentially, large p implies a large amount of recorded information. 1.2.1 Malicious Agents Decentralized mechanisms often utilize punishing outcomes.",
                "As a result, malicious players might cause severe harm to others.",
                "We suggest a quantified notion of malicious player, who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm caused to others. [12] suggests several categories to classify non-cooperating players.",
                "Our approach is similar to [7] (and the references therein), who considered independently such players in different context.",
                "We show a simple decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and in particular, do not use their punishing actions in equilibrium. 241 1.3 Dominant Strategy Implementations In this subsection we shall refer to some recent results demonstrating that the set-up of private information with the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general.",

                "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",
                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",

                "We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3.",

                "First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].",

                "Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies.",

                "In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero.",
                "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",
                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",
                "Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him. 1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.",
                "In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.",
                "More formally, we say that agent B is p-informed about agent A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of <br>iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies</br>.",

                "We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3.",

                "First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].",

                "This condition is very restrictive, as many desired natural goals are non-monotone2 .",
                "Several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant strategy concept: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21].",
                "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",

                "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",

                "Third, the constructed mechanisms are often decentralized (i.e., lacking a centralized authority or designer) 1 Interestingly, in real life players do not always use their subgame perfect strategies.",
                "One such widely studied case is the Ultimatum Bargaining 2-person game.",
                "In this simple game, the proposer first makes an offer of how to divide a certain known sum of money, and the responder either agrees or refuses, in the latter case both players earn zero.",
                "Somewhat surprisingly, experiments show that the responder often rejects the suggested offer, even if it is bounded away from zero and the game is played only once (see e.g. [38]). and budget-balanced (i.e., transfers always sum up to zero).",
                "This happens essentially if there are at least three players, and a direct network link between any two agents.",
                "Finally, Moore and Repullo observed that they actually use a relaxed complete information assumption: it is only required that for every player there exists only one other player who is informed about him. 1.2 Implementations in Partially Informed Set-ups and Our Results The complete information assumption is realistic for small groups of players, but not in general.",
                "In this paper we consider players that are informed about each other with some probability.",
                "More formally, we say that <br>agent</br> B is p-informed about <br>agent</br> A, if B knows the type of A with probability p. For such partially-informed environments, we show how to use the solution concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies.",

                "We first show how the subgame perfect techniques of Moore and Repullo [28] can be applied to p-informed environments and further adjusted to the concept of iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies (for large enough p). 2.",
                "We then suggest a certificate based challenging method that is more natural in computerized p-informed environments and different from the one introduced by Moore and Repullo [28] (for p ∈ (0, 1]). 3.",
                "We consider implementations in various network structures.",

                "Essentially, large p implies a large amount of recorded information. 1.2.1 Malicious Agents Decentralized mechanisms often utilize punishing outcomes.",
                "As a result, malicious players might cause severe harm to others.",
                "We suggest a quantified notion of malicious player, who benefits from his own gained surplus and from harm caused to others. [12] suggests several categories to classify non-cooperating players.",
                "Our approach is similar to [7] (and the references therein), who considered independently such players in different context.",
                "We show a simple decentralized mechanism in which q-malicious players cooperate and in particular, do not use their punishing actions in equilibrium. 241 1.3 Dominant Strategy Implementations In this subsection we shall refer to some recent results demonstrating that the set-up of private information with the concept of dominant strategies is restrictive in general.",
                "First, Roberts classical impossibility result shows that if players preferences are not restricted and there are at least 3 different outcomes, then every dominant-strategy mechanism must be weighted VCG (with the social goal that maximizes the weighted welfare) [35].",
                "For slightly-restricted preference domains, it is not known how to turn efficiently computable algorithms into dominant strategy mechanisms.",
                "This was observed and analyzed in [32, 22, 31].",
                "Recently [20] extends Roberts result to some leading examples.",
                "They showed that under mild assumptions any dominant strategy mechanism for variety of Combinatorial Auctions over multi-dimensional domains must be almost weighted VCG.",
                "Additionally, it turns out that the dominant strategy requirement implies that the social goal must be monotone [35, 36, 22, 20, 5, 37].",
                "This condition is very restrictive, as many desired natural goals are non-monotone2 .",
                "Several recent papers consider relaxations of the dominant strategy concept: [32, 1, 2, 19, 16, 17, 26, 21].",
                "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",
                "Recently, [8, 3] considered implementations for generalized single-parameter players.",

                "However, most of these positive results either apply to severely restricted cases (e.g., single-parameter, 2 players) or amount to VCG or almost VCG mechanisms (e.g., [19]).",
