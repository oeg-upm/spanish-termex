In order to develop systems actually implementing institutions and organizations, formal methods should take the place of heuristic ones. The paper presents a formal semantics for the notion of institution and its components (abstract and concrete norms, empowerment of agents, roles) and defines a formal relation between institutions and organizational structures. As a result, it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented system. It is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification.

INTRODUCTION The opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of organizational and social theory to distributed AI and multiagent systems (MASs) has long been advocated ([8]). In MASs the application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system design has proven to be useful for the development of methodologies and tools. In many cases, however, the application of these conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high level design of the systems. It is our thesis that the application of those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure, etc. obtain a formal semantics. This has been the case for agent programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.) have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]). As a matter of fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures and programming languages. What is lacking at the moment for the design and development of open MASs is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that BDI-like formalisms have played for the design and development of single-agent architectures. Aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one. The main result of the paper consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications. Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement. In Section 3 the framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution. The extended framework is then studied in relation to the formalism for representing organizational structures presented in [11]. In Section 4 some conclusions follow. 2. INSTITUTIONS Social theory usually thinks of institutions as the rules of the game ([18, 23]). From an agent perspective institutions are, to paraphrase this quote, the rules of the various games agents can play in order to interact with one another. To assume an institutional perspective on MASs means therefore to think of MASs in normative terms: [. . . ] law, computer systems, and many other kinds of organizational structure may be viewed as instances of normative systems. We use the term to refer to any set of interacting agents whose behavior can usefully be regarded as governed by norms ([15], p.276). The normative system perspective on institutions is, as such, nothing original and it is already a quite acknowledged position within the community working on electronic institutions, or eInstitutions ([26]). What has not been sufficiently investigated and understood with formal methods is, in our view, the question: what does it 628 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS amount to, for a MAS, to be put under a set of norms? Or in other words: what does it mean for a designer of an eInstitution to state a set of norms? We advance a precise thesis on this issue, which is also inspired by work in social theory: Now, as the original manner of producing physical entities is creation, there is hardly a better way to describe the production of moral entities than by the word imposition [impositio]. For moral entities do not arise from the intrinsic substantial principles of things but are superadded to things already existent and physically complete ([21], pp. 100-101). By ignoring for a second the philosophical jargon of the Seventeenth century we can easily extract an illuminating message from the excerpt: what institutions do is to impose properties on already existing entities. That is to say, institutions provide descriptions of entities by making use of conceptualizations that are not proper of the common descriptions of those entities. For example, that cars have wheels is a common factual property, whereas the fact that cars count as vehicles in some technical legal sense is a property that law imposes on the concept car. To say it with [25], the fact that cars have wheels is a brute fact, while the fact that cars are vehicles is an institutional fact. Institutions build structured descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a given domain. At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc. They do this via linking some institutional properties of the possible states and transitions of the system (e.g., agent i enacts role r) to some brute properties of those states and transitions (e.g., agent i performs protocol No.56). An institutional property is therefore a property of system states or system transitions (i.e., a state type or a transition type) that does not belong to a merely technical, or factual, description of the system. To sum up, institution are viewed as sets of norms (normative system perspective), and norms are thought of as the imposition of an institutional description of the system upon its description in terms of brute properties. In a nutshell, institutions are impositions of institutional terminologies upon brute ones. The following sections provide a formal analysis of this thesis and show its explanatory power in delivering a rigorous understanding of key features of institutions. Because of its suitability for representing complex domain descriptions, the formal framework we will make use of is the one of Description Logics (DL). The use of such formalism will also stress the idea of viewing institutions as the impositions of domain descriptions. 2.1 Preliminaries: a very expressive DL The description logic language enabling the necessary expressivity expands the standard description logic language ALC ([3]) with relational operators ( ,◦,¬,id) to express complex transition types, and relational hierarchies (H) to express inclusion between transition types. Following a notational convention common within DL we denote this language with ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) . DEFINITION 1. (Syntax of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) ) transition types and state type constructs are defined by the following BNF: α := a | α ◦ α | α α | ¬α | id(γ) γ := c | ⊥ | ¬γ | γ γ | ∀α.γ where a and c are atomic transition types and, respectively, atomic state types. It is worth providing the intuitive reading of a couple of the operators and the constructs just introduced. In particular ∀α.γ has to be read as: after all executions of transitions of type α, states of type γ are reached. The operator ◦ denotes the concatenation of transition types. The operator id applies to a state description γ and yields a transition description, namely, the transition ending in γ states. It is the description logic variant of the test operator in Dynamic Logic ([5]). Notice that we use the same symbols and ¬ for denoting the boolean operators of disjunction and negation of both state and transition types. Atomic state types c are often indexed by an agent identifier i in order to express agent properties (e.g., dutch(i)), and atomic transition types a are often indexed by a pair of agent identifiers (i, j) (e.g., PAY(i, j)) denoting the actor and, respectively, the recipient of the transition. By removing the agent identifiers from state types and transition types we obtain state type forms (e.g., dutch or rea(r)) and transition type form (e.g., PAY). A terminological box (henceforth TBox) T = Γ, A consists of a finite set Γ of state type inclusion assertions (γ1 γ2), and of a finite set A of transition type inclusion assertions (α1 α2). The semantics of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is model theoretical and it is given in terms of interpreted transition systems. As usual, state types are interpreted as sets of states and transition types as sets of state pairs. DEFINITION 2. (Semantics of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) ) An interpreted transition system m for ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is a structure S, I where S is a non-empty set of states and I is a function such that: I(c) ⊆ S I(a) ⊆ S × S I(⊥) = ∅ I(¬γ) = Δm\\ I(γ) I(γ1 γ2) = I(γ1) ∩ I(γ2) I(∀α.γ) = {s ∈ S | ∀t, (s, t) ∈ I(α) ⇒ t ∈ I(γ)} I(α1 α2) = I(α1) ∪ I(α2) I(¬α) = S × S \\ I(α) I(α1 ◦ α2) = {(s, s ) | ∃s , (s, s ) ∈ I(α1) & (s , s ) ∈ I(α2)} I(id(γ)) = {(s, s) | s ∈ I(γ)} An interpreted transition system m is a model of a state type inclusion assertion γ1 γ2 if I(γ1) ⊆ I(γ2). It is a model of a transition type inclusion assertion α1 α2 if I(α1) ⊆ I(α2). An interpreted transition system m is a model of a TBox T = Γ, A if m is a model of each inclusion assertion in Γ and A. REMARK 1. (Derived constructs) The correspondence between description logic and dynamic logic is well-known ([3]). In fact, the language presented in Definitions 1 and 2 is a notational variant of the language of Dynamic Logic ([5]) without the iteration operator of transition types. As a consequence, some key constructs are still definable in ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) . In particular we will make use of the following definition of the if-then-else transition type: if γ then α1else α2 = (id(γ) ◦ α1) (id(¬γ) ◦ α2). Boolean operators are defined as usual. We will come back to some complexity features of this logic in Section 2.5. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 629 2.2 Institutions as terminologies We have upheld that institutions impose new system descriptions which are formulated in terms of sets of norms. The step toward a formal grounding of this view of institutions is now short: norms can be thought of as terminological axioms, and institutions as sets of terminological axioms, i.e., terminological boxes. An institution can be specified as a terminological box Ins = Γins, Ains , where each inclusion statement in Γins and Ains models a norm of the institution. Obviously, not every TBox can be considered to be an institution specification. In particular, an institution specification Ins must have some precise linguistic relationship with the brute descriptions upon which the institution is specified. We denote by Lins the non-logical alphabet containing only institutional state and transition types, and by Lbrute the nonlogical alphabet containing those types taken to talk about, instead, brute states and transitions1 . DEFINITION 3. (Institutions as TBoxes) A TBox Ins = Γins, Ains is an institution specification if: 1. The non-logical alphabet on which Ins is specified contains elements of both Lins and Lbrute. In symbols: L(Ins) ⊆ Lins ∪ Lbrute. 2. There exist sets of terminological axioms Γbridge ⊆ Γins and Abridge ⊆ Ains such that either the left-hand side of these axioms is always a description expressed in Lbrute and the right-hand side a description expressed in Lins, or those axioms are definitions. In symbols: if γ1 γ2 ∈ Γbridge then either γ1 ∈ Lbrute and γ2 ∈ Lins or it is the case that also γ2 γ1 ∈ Γbridge. The clause for Abridge is analogous. 3. The remaining sets of terminological axioms Γins\\Γbridge and Ains\\Abridge are all expressed in Lins. In symbols: L(Γins\\Γbridge) ⊆ Lins and L(Ains\\Abridge) ⊆ Lins. The definition states that an institution specification needs to be expressed on a language including institutional as well as brute terms (1); that a part of the specification concerns a description of mere institutional terms (3); and that there needs to be a part of the specification which connects institutional terms to brute ones (2). Terminological axioms in Γbridge and Abridge formalize in DL the Searlean notion of counts-as conditional ([25]), that is, rules stating what kind of meaning an institution gives to certain brute facts and transitions (e.g., checking box No.4 in form No.2 counts as accepting your personal data to be used for research purposes). A formal theory of counts-as statements has been thoroughly developed in a series of papers among which [10, 13]. The technical content of the present paper heavily capitalizes on that work. Notice also that given the semantics presented in Definition 2, if institutions can be specified via TBoxes then the meaning of such specifications is a set of interpreted transition systems, i.e., the models of those TBoxes. These transitions systems can be in turn thought of as all the possible MASs which model the specified institution. REMARK 2. (Lbrute from a designers perspective) From a design perspective language Lbrute has to be thought of as the language on which a designer would specify a system instantiating a given institution2 . Definition 3 shows that for such a design task 1 Symbols from Lins and Lbrute will be indexed (especially with agent identifiers) to add some syntactic sugar. 2 To make a concrete example, the AMELI middleware [7] can be viewed as a specification tool at a Lbrute level. it is needed to formally specify an explicit bridge between the concepts used in the description of the actual system and the institutional abstract concepts. We will come back to this issue in Section 3. 2.3 From abstract to concrete norms To illustrate Definition 3, and show its explanatory power, an example follows which depicts an essential phenomenon of institutions. EXAMPLE 1. (From abstract to concrete norms) Consider an institution supposed to regulate access to a set of public web services. It may contain the following norm: it is forbidden to discriminate access on the basis of citizenship. Suppose now a system has to be built which complies with this norm. The first question is: what does it mean, in concrete, to discriminate on the basis of citizenship? The system designer should make some concrete choices for interpreting the norm and these choices should be kept track of in order to explicitly link the abstract norm to its concrete interpretation. The problem can be represented as follows. The abstract norm is formalized by Formula 1 by making use of a standard reduction technique of deontic notions (see [16]): the statement it is forbidden to discriminate on the basis of citizenship amounts to the statement after every execution of a transition of type DISCR(i, j) the system always ends up in a violation state. Together with the norm also some intuitive background knowledge about the discrimination action needs to be formalized. Here, as well as in the rest of the examples in the paper, we provide just that part of the formalization which is strictly functional to show how the formalism works in practice. Formulae 2 and 3 express two effect laws: if the requester j is Dutch then after all executions of transitions of type DISCR(i, j) j is accepted by i, whereas if it is not all the executions of the transitions of the same type have as an effect that it is not accepted. All formulae have to be read as schemata determining a finite number of subsumption expressions depending on the number of agents i, j considered. ∀DISCR(i, j).viol ≡ (1) dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).accepted(j) (2) ¬dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).¬accepted(j) (3) The rest of the axioms concern the translation of the abstract type DISCR(i, j) to concrete transition types. Formula 4 refines it by making explicit that a precise if-then-else procedure counts as a discriminatory act of agent i. Formulae 5 and 6 specify which messages of i to j count as acceptance and rejection. If the designer uses transition types SEND(msg33, i, j) and SEND(msg38, i, j) for the concrete system specification, then Formulae 5 and 6 can be thought of as bridge axioms connecting notions belonging to the institutional alphabet (to accept, and to reject) to concrete ones (to send specific messages). Finally, Formulae 7 and 8 state two intuitive effect laws concerning the ACCEPT(i, j) and REJECT(i, j) types. if dutch(j)then ACCEPT(i, j) else REJECT(i, j) DISCR(i, j) (4) SEND(msg33, i, j) ACCEPT(i, j) (5) SEND(msg38, i, j) REJECT(i, j) (6) ∀ACCEPT(i, j).accepted(j) ≡ (7) ∀REJECT(i, j).¬accepted(j) ≡ (8) It is easy to see, on the grounds of the semantics exposed in Definition 2, that the following concrete inclusion statement holds w.r.t. 630 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) the specified institution: if dutch(j) then SEND(msg33, i, j) else SEND(msg38, i, j) DISCR(i, j) (9) This scenario exemplifies a pervasive feature of human institutions which, as extensively argued in [10], should be incorporated by electronic ones. Current formal approaches to institutions, such as ISLANDER [6], do not allow for the formal specification of explicit translations of abstract norms into concrete ones, and focus only on norms that can be specified at the concrete system specification level. What Example 1 shows is that the problem of the abstractness of norms in institutions can be formally addressed and can be given a precise formal semantics. The scenario suggests that, just by modifying an appropriate set of terminological axioms, it is possible for the designer to obtain a different institution by just modifying the sets of bridge axioms without touching the terminological axioms expressed only in the institutional language Lins. In fact, it is the case that a same set of abstract norms can be translated to different and even incompatible sets of concrete norms. This translation can nevertheless not be arbitrary ([1]). EXAMPLE 2. (Acceptable and unacceptable translations of abstract norms) Reconsider again the scenario sketched in Example 1. The transition type DISCR(i, j) has been translated to a complex procedure composed by concrete transition types. Would any translation do? Consider an alternative institution specification Ins containing Formulae 1-3 and the following translation rule: PAY(j, i, e10) DISCR(i, j) (10) Would this formula be an acceptable translation of the abstract norm expressed in Formula 1? The axiom states that transitions where i receives e10 from j count as transitions of type DISCR(i, j). Needless to say this is not intuitive, because the abstract transition type DISCR(i, j) obeys some intuitive conceptual constraints (Formulae 2 and 3) that all its translations should also obey. In fact, the following inclusions would then hold in Ins : dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).accepted(j) (11) ¬dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).¬accepted(j) (12) In fact, there properties of the transition type PAY(j, i, e10) look at least awkward: if an agent is Dutch than by paying e10 it would be accepted, while if it was not Dutch the same action would make it not accepted. The problem is that the meaning of paying is not intuitively subsumed by the meaning of discriminating. In other words, a transition type PAY(j, i, e10) does not intuitively yield the effects that a sub-type of DISCR(i, j) yields. It is on the contrary perfectly intuitive that Formula 9 obeys the constraints in Formulae 2 and 3, which it does, as it can be easily checked on the grounds of the semantics. It is worth stressing that without providing a model-theoretic semantics for the translation rules linking the institutional notions to the brute ones, it would not be so straightforward to model the logical constraints to which the translations are subjected (Example 2). This is precisely the advantage of viewing translation rules as specific terminological axioms, i.e., Γbridge and Abridge, working as a bridge between two languages (Definition 3). In [12], we have thoroughly compared this approach with approaches such as [9] which conceive of translation rules as inference rules. The two examples have shown how our approach can account for some essential features of institutions. In the next section the same framework is applied to provide a formal analysis of the notion of role. 2.4 Institutional modules and roles Viewing institutions as the impositions of institutional descriptions on systems states and transitions allows for analyzing the normative system perspective itself (i.e., institutions are sets of norms) at a finer granularity. We have seen that the terminological axioms specifying an institution concern complex descriptions of new institutional notions. Some of the institutional state types occurring in the institution specification play a key role in structuring the specification of the institution itself. The paradigmatic example in this sense ([25]) are facts such as agent i enacts role r which will be denoted by state types rea(i, r). By stating how an agent can enact and deact a role r, and what normative consequences follow from the enactment of r, an institution describes expected forms of agents behavior while at the same time abstracting from the concrete agents taking part to the system. The sets of norms specifying an institution can be clustered on the grounds of the rea state types. For each relevant institutional state type (e.g., rea(i, r)), the terminological axioms which define an institution, i.e., its norms, can be clustered in (possibly overlapping) sets of three different types: the axioms specifying how states of that institutional type can be reached (e.g., how an agent i can enact the role r); how states of that type can be left (e.g., how an agent i can deact the a role r); and what kind of institutional consequences do those states bear (e.g., what rights and power does agent i acquire by enacting role r). Borrowing the terminology from work in legal and institutional theory ([23, 25]), these clusters of norms can be called, respectively, institutive, terminative and status modules. Status modules We call status modules those sets of terminological axioms which specify the institutional consequences of the occurrence of a given institutional state-of-affairs, for instance, the fact that agent i enacts role r. EXAMPLE 3. (A status module for roles) Enacting a role within an institution bears some institutional consequences that are grouped under the notion of status: by playing a role an agent acquires a specific status. Some of these consequences are deontic and concern the obligations, rights, permissions under which the agent puts itself once it enacts the role. An example which pertains to the normative description of the status of both a buyer and a seller roles is the following: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) ∀¬PAY(i, j, b).viol(i) (13) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role and i wins bid b then if i does not perform a transition of type PAY (i, j, b), i.e., does not pay to j the price corresponding to bid b, then the system ends up in a state that the institution classifies as a violation state with i being the violator. Notice that Formula 13 formalizes at the same time an obligation pertaining to the role buyer and a right pertaining to the role seller. Of particular interest are then those consequences that attribute powers to agents enacting specific roles: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) ∀BID(i, j, b).bid(i, j, b) (14) SEND(i, j, msg49) BID(i, j, b) (15) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role, every time agent i bids b to j this action results in an institutional state testifying that the corresponding bid has been placed by i (Formula 14). Formula 15 states how the bidding action can be executed by sending a specific message to j (SEND(i, j, msg49)). Some observations are in order. As readers acquainted with deontic logic have probably already noticed, our treatment of the notion The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 631 of obligation (Formula 13) makes again use of a standard reduction approach ([16]). More interesting is instead how the notion of institutional power is modeled. Essentially, the empowerment phenomenon is analyzed in term of two rules: one specifying the institutional effects of an institutional action (Formula 14), and one translating the institutional transition type in a brute one (Formula 15). Systems of rules of this type empower the agents enacting some relevant role by establishing a connection between the brute actions of the agents and some institutional effect. Whether the agents are actually able to execute the required brute actions is a different issue, since agent i can be in some states (or even all states) unable to effectuate a SEND(i, j, msg49) transition. This is the case also in human societies: priests are empowered to give rise to marriages but if a priest is not in state of performing the required speech acts he is actually unable to marry anybody. There is a difference between being entitled to make a bid and being in state of making a bid ([4]). In other words, Formulae 14 and 15 express only that agents playing the buyer role are entitled to make bids. The actual possibility of performing the required brute actions is not an institutional issue, but rather an issue concerning the implementation of an institution in a concrete system. We address this issue extensively in Section 33 . Institutive modules We call institutive modules those sets of terminological axioms of an institution specification describing how states with certain institutional properties can be reached, for instance, how an agent i can reach a state in which it enacts role r. They can be seen as procedures that the institution define in order for the agents to bring institutional states of affairs about. EXAMPLE 4. (An institutive module for roles) The fact that an agent i enacts a role r (rea(i, r)) is the effect of a corresponding enactment action ENACT(i, r) performed under certain circumstances (Formula 16), namely that the agent does not already enact the role, and that the agent satisfies given conditions (cond(i, r)), which might for instance pertain the computational capabilities required for an agent to play the chosen role, or its capability to interact with some specific systems infrastructures. Formula 17 specifies instead the procedure counting as an action of type ENACT(i, r). Such a procedure is performed through a system infrastructure s, which notifies to i that it has been registered as enacting role r after sending the necessary piece of data d (SEND(i, s, d)), e.g., a valid credit card number. ¬rea(i, r) cond(i, r) ENACT(i, r).rea(i, r) (16) SEND(i, s, d) ◦ NOTIFY(s, i) ENACT(i, r) (17) Terminative modules Analogously, we call terminative modules those sets of terminological axioms stating how a state with certain institutional properties can be left. Rules of this kind state for instance how an agent can stop enacting a certain role. They can be thus thought of as procedures that the institution defines in order for the agent to see to it that certain institutional states stop holding. EXAMPLE 5. (A terminative module for roles) Terminative modules for roles specify, for instance, how a transition type DEACT(i, r) can be executed which has as consequence the reaching of a state of type ¬rea(i, r): rea(i, r) DEACT(i, r).¬rea(i, r) (18) SEND(i, s, msg9) DEACT(i, r) (19) That is to say, i deacting a role r always leads to a state where 3 See in particular Example 6 and Definition 5 i does not enact role r; and i sending message No.9 to a specific interface infrastructure s count as i deacting role r. Examples 3-5 have shown how roles can be formalized in our framework thereby getting a formal semantics: roles are also sets of terminological axioms concerning state types of the sort rea(i, r). It is worth noticing that this modeling option is aligned with work on social theory addressing the concept of role such as [20]. 2.5 Tractable specifications of institutions In the previous sections we fully deployed the expressivity of the language introduced in Section 2.1 and used its semantics to provide a formal understanding of many essential aspects of institutions in terms of transition systems. This section spends a few words about the viability of performing automated reasoning in the logic presented. The satisfiability problem4 in logic ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is undecidable since transition type inclusion axioms correspond to a version of what in Description Logic are known as role-value maps and logics extending ALC with role-value maps are known to be undecidable ([3]). Tractable (i.e., polynomial time decidable) fragments of logic ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) can however be isolated which still exhibit some key expressive features. One of them is logic ELH(◦) . It is obtained from description logic EL, which contains only state types intersection , existential restriction ∃ and 5 , but extended with the ⊥ state type and with transition type inclusion axioms of a complex form: a1 ◦. . .◦an a (with n finite number). Logic ELH(◦) is also a fragment of the well investigated description logic EL++ whose satisfiability problem has been shown in [2] to be decidable in polynomial time. Despite the very limited expressivity of this fragment, some rudimentary institutional specifications can still be successfully represented. Specifically, institutive and terminative modules can be represented which contain transition types inclusion axioms. Restricted versions of status modules can also be represented enabling two essential deontic notions: it is possible (respectively, impossible) to reach a violation state by performing a transition of a certain type, and it is possible (respectively, impossible) to reach a legal state by performing a transition of a certain type. To this aim language Lins would need to be expanded with a set of state types {legal(i)}0≤i≤n whose intuitive meaning is to denote legal states as opposed to states of type viol(i). Fragments like ELH(◦) could be used as target logics within theory approximation approaches ([24]) by aiming at compiling TBoxes expressed in ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) into approximations in those fragments. 3. FROM NORMS TO STRUCTURES 3.1 Infrastructures In discussing Example 3 we observed how being entitled to make a bid does not imply being in state of making a bid. In other words, an institution can empower agents by means of appropriate rules but this empowerment can remain dead letter. Similar 4 This problem amounts to check whether a state description γ is satisfiable w.r.t. a given TBox T, i.e., to check if there exists a model m of T such that ∅ ⊂ I(γ). Notice that language ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) contains negation and intersection of arbitrary state types. It is well-known that if these operators are available then all most typical reasoning tasks at the TBox level can be reduced to the satisfiability problem. 5 Notice therefore that EL is a seriously restricted fragment of ALC since it does not contain the negation operator for state types (operators and ∀ remain thus undefinable). 632 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) observations apply also to deontic notions: agents might be allowed to perform certain transactions under some relevant conditions but they might be unable to do so under those same conditions. We refer to this kind of problems as infrastructural. The implementation of an institution in a concrete system calls therefore for the design of appropriate infrastructures or artifacts ([19]). The formal specification of an infrastructure amounts to the formal specification of interaction requirements, that is to say, the specification of which relevant transition types are executable and under what conditions. DEFINITION 4. (Infrastructures as TBoxes) An infrastructure Inf = Γinf , Ainf for institution Ins is a TBox on Lbrute such that for all a ∈ L(Abridge) there exist terminological axioms in Γinf of the following form: γ ≡ ∃a. (a is executable exactly in γ states) and γ ≡ ∃¬a. (the negation of a is executable exactly in γ states). In other words, an infrastructure specification states all and only the conditions under which an atomic brute transition type and its negation are executable, which occur in the brute alphabet of the bridge axioms of Ins. It states what can be in concrete done and under what conditions. EXAMPLE 6. (Infrastructure specification) Consider the institution specified in Example 1. A simple infrastructure Inf for that institution could contain for instance the following terminological axioms for any pair of different agents i, j and message type msg: ∃SEND(msg33, i, j). (20) The formula states that it is always in the possibilities of agent i to send message No. 33 to agent j. It then follows on the grounds of Example 1 that agent i can always accept agent j. ∃ACCEPT(i, j). (21) Notice that the executability condition is just . We call a concrete institution specification CIns an institution specification Ins coupled with an infrastructure specification Inf. DEFINITION 5. (Concrete institution) A concrete institution obtained by joining the institution Ins = Γins, Ains and the infrastructure Inf = Γinf , Ainf is a TBox CIns = Γ, A such that Γ = Γins ∪ Γinf and A = Ains ∪ Ainf . Obviously, different infrastructures can be devised for a same institution giving rise to different concrete institutions which makes precise implementation choices explicit. Of particular relevance are the implementation choices concerning abstract norms like the one represented in Formula 13. A designer can choose to regiment such norm ([15]), i.e., make violation states unreachable, via an appropriate infrastructure. EXAMPLE 7. (Regimentation via infrastructure specification) Consider Example 3 and suppose the following translation rule to be also part of the institution: BNK(i, j, b) CC(i, j, b) ≡ PAY(i, j, b) (22) condition pay(i, j, b) ≡ rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) (23) The first formula states how the payment can be concretely carried out (via bank transfer or credit card) and the second just provides a concrete label grouping the institutional state types relevant for the norm. In order to specify a regimentation at the infrastructural level it is enough to state that: condition pay(i, j, b) ≡ ∃(BNK(i, j, b) CC(i, j, b)). (24) ¬condition pay(i, j, b) ≡ ∃¬(BNK(i, j, b) CC(i, j, b)). (25) In other words, in states of type condition pay(i, j, b) the only executable brute actions are BANK(i, j, b) or CC(i, j, b) and, therefore, PAY(i, j, b) would necessarily be executed. As a result, the following inclusion does not hold with respect to the corresponding concrete institution: condition pay(i, j, b) ∃¬PAY(i).viol(i). 3.2 Organizational Structures This section briefly summarizes and adapts the perspective and results on organizational structures presented in [14, 11]. We refer to that work for a more comprehensive exposition. Organizational structures typically concern the way agents interact within organizations. These interactions can be depicted as the links of a graph defined on the set of roles of the organization. Such links are then to be labeled on the basis of the type of interaction they stand for. First of all, it should be clear whether a link denotes that a certain interaction between two roles can, or ought to, or may etc. take place. Secondly, links should be labeled according to the transition type α they refer to and the conditions γ in which that transition can, ought to, may etc. take place. Links in a formal specification of an organizational structure stand therefore for statements of the kind: role r can (ought to, may) execute α w.r.t. role s if γ is the case. For the sake of simplicity, the following definition will consider only the can and ought-to interaction modalities. State and transition types in Lins ∪Lbrute will be used to label the links of the structure. Interaction modalities can therefore be of an institutional kind or of a brute kind. DEFINITION 6. (Organizational structure) An organizational structure is a multi-graph: OS = Roles, {Cp}p∈Mod, {Op}p∈Mod where: • Mod denotes a set of pairs p = γ : α, that is, a set of state type (condition) and transition type (action) pairs of Lins∪Lbrute with α being an atomic transition-type indexed with a pair (i, j) denoting placeholders for the actor and the recipient of the transition; • C (can) denotes links to be interpreted in terms of the executability of the related α in γ, whereas O (ought) denotes links to be interpreted in terms of the obligation to execute the related α in γ. By the expressions (r, s) ∈ Cγ:α and (r, s) ∈ Oγ:α we mean therefore: agents enacting role r can and, respectively, ought to interact with agents enacting role s by performing α in states of type γ. As shown in [11] such formal representations of organizational structures are of use for investigating the structural properties (robustness, flexibility, etc.) that a given organization exhibits. At this point all the formal means are put in place which allow us to formally represent institutions as well as organizational structures. The next and final step of the work consists in providing a formal relation between the two frameworks. This formal relation will make explicit how institutions are related to organizational structures and vice versa. In particular, it will become clear how a normative conception of the notion of role relates to a structural one, that is, how the view of roles as a sets of norms (specifying how an agent can enact and deact the role, and what social status it obtains by doing that) relates to the view of roles as positions within social structures. 3.3 Relating institutions to organizations The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 633 To translate a given concrete institution into a corresponding organizational structure we need a function t assigning pairs of roles to axioms. Let us denote with Sub the set of all state type inclusion statements γ1 γ2 that can be expressed on Lins ∪ Lbrute. Function t is a partial function Sub Roles × Roles such that, for any x ∈ Sub if x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. (executability) or x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (obligation) then t(x) = (r, s), where α is an atomic transition-type indexed with a pair (i, j). That is to say, executability and obligation laws containing the enactment configuration rea(i, r) rea(j, s) as a premise and concerning transition of types α, with i actor and j recipient of the α transition, are translated into role pairs (r, s). DEFINITION 7. (Correspondence of specifications) A concrete institution CIns = Γ, A is said to correspond to an organizational structure OS (and vice versa) if, for every x ∈ Γ: • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. iff t(x) ∈ Cγ:α • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) iff t(x) ∈ Oγ:α Intuitively, function t takes axioms from Γ (i.e., the set of state type terminological axioms of CIns) and yields pairs of roles. Definition 7 labels the yielded pairs accordingly to the syntactic form of the translated axioms. More concretely, axioms of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. (executability laws) are translated into the pair (r, s) belonging to the executability dimension (i.e., C) of the organizational structure w.r.t. the execution of α under circumstances γ. Analogously, axioms of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (obligation laws) are translated into the pair (r, s) belonging to the obligation dimension (i.e., O) of the organizational structure w.r.t. the execution of α under circumstances γ. Leaving technicalities aside, function t distills thus the terminological and infrastructural constraints of CIns into structural ones. The institutive, terminative and status modules of roles are translated into definitions of positions within a OS. From a design perspective the interpretation of Definition 7 is twofold. On the one hand (from left to right), it can make explicit what the structural consequences are of a given institution supported by a given infrastructure. On the other hand (from right to left), it can make explicit what kind of institution is actually implemented by a given organizational structure. Let us see this in some more details. Given a concrete institution CIns, Definition 7 allows a designer to be aware of the impact that specific terminological choices (in particular, the choice of certain bridge axioms) and infrastructural ones have at a structural level. Notice that Definition 7 supports the inference of links in a structure. By checking whether a given inclusion statement of the relevant syntactic form follows from CIns (i.e., the so-called subsumption problem of DL) it is possible, via t, to add new links to the corresponding organizational structure. This can be recursively done by just adding any new inferred inclusion x to the previous set of axioms Γ, thus obtaining an updated institutional specification containing Γ ∪ {x}. This process can be thought of as the inference of structural links from institutional specifications. In other words, it is possible to use institution specifications as inference tools for structural specifications. For instance, the infrastructural choice formalized in Example 7 implies that for the pair of roles (buyer, seller), it is always the case that (buyer, seller) ∈ C :PAY(i,j,b). This link follows from links (buyer, seller) ∈ C :BNK(i,j,b) and (buyer, seller) ∈ C :CC(i,j,b) on the grounds of the bridge axioms of the institution (Formula 22). Suppose now a designer to be interested in a system which, besides implementing an institution, also incorporates an organizational structure enjoying desirable structural properties such as flexibility, or robustness6 . By relating structural links to state type inclusions it is therefore possible to check whether adding a link in OS results in a stronger institutional specification, that is, if the corresponding inclusion statement is not already implied by Ins. To draw a parallelism with what just said in the previous paragraph, this process can be thought of as the inference of norms and infrastructural constraints from the specification of organizational structures. To give a simple example consider again Example 6 but from a reversed perspective. Suppose a designer wants a fully connected graph in the dimension C :SEND(i,j) of the organizational structure. Exploiting Definition 7, we would obtain a number of executability laws in the fashion of Formula 20 for all roles in Roles (thus 2|Roles| axioms). Definition 7 establishes a correspondence between two essentially different perspectives on the design of open systems allowing for feedbacks between the two to be formally analyzed. One last observation is in order. While given a concrete institution an organizational structure can be in principle fully specified (by checking for all -finitely many- relevant inclusion statements whether they are implied or not by the institution), it is not possible to obtain a full terminological specification from an organizational structure. This lies on the fact that in Definition 6 the strictly terminological information contained in the specification of an institution (eminently, the set of transition type axioms A and therefore the bridge axioms) is lost while moving to a structural description. This shows, in turn, that the added value of the specification of institutions lies precisely in the terminological link they establish between institutional and brute, i.e., system level notions. 4. CONCLUSIONS The paper aimed at providing a comprehensive formal analysis of the institutional metaphor and its relation to the organizational one. The predominant formal tool has been description logic. TBoxes has been used to represent the specifications of institutions (Definition 3) and their infrastructures (Definition 6), providing therefore a transition system semantics for a number of institutional notions (Examples 1-7). Multi-graphs has then been used to represent the specification of organizational structures (Definition 6). The last result presented concerned the definition of a formal correspondence between institution and organization specifications (Definition 7), which provides a formal way for switching between the two paradigms. All in all, these results deliver a way for relating abstract system specifications (i.e., institutions as sets of norms) to specifications that are closer to an implemented system (i.e., organizational structures). 5.

Para desarrollar sistemas que realmente implementen instituciones y organizaciones, los métodos formales deberían tomar el lugar de las heurísticas. El documento presenta una semántica formal para la noción de institución y sus componentes (normas abstractas y concretas, empoderamiento de los agentes, roles) y define una relación formal entre las instituciones y las estructuras organizativas. Como resultado, se muestra cómo las normas institucionales se pueden refinar para construir estructuras de organización, que están más cerca de un sistema implementado. También se muestra cómo dicho proceso de refinamiento puede formarse por completo y, por lo tanto, es susceptible de verificación rigurosa.

INTRODUCCIÓN La oportunidad de una transferencia de tecnología desde el campo de la teoría organizacional y social a la IA distribuida y los sistemas multiagentes (MASS) se ha recomendado durante mucho tiempo ([8]). En masa, la aplicación de las metáforas organizacionales e institucionales al diseño del sistema ha demostrado ser útil para el desarrollo de metodologías y herramientas. En muchos casos, sin embargo, la aplicación de estos aparatos conceptuales equivale a una mera heurística que guía el diseño de alto nivel de los sistemas. Es nuestra tesis que la aplicación de esos aparatos puede empujarse aún más una vez que sus conceptos clave se tratan formalmente, es decir, una vez que nociones como la norma, el rol, la estructura, etc. obtienen una semántica formal. Este ha sido el caso de los lenguajes de programación de agentes después de que los conceptos relevantes tomados de la psicología popular (creencia, intención, deseo, conocimiento, etc.) se hayan abordado en teorías lógicas formales integrales como, por ejemplo, bdictl ([22]) yKaro ([17]). De hecho, esas teorías han fomentado la producción de arquitecturas y lenguajes de programación. Lo que falta en este momento para el diseño y el desarrollo de la masa abierta es, en nuestra opinión, algo que puede desempeñar el papel que los formalismos similares a BDI han jugado para el diseño y el desarrollo de arquitecturas de un solo agente. El objetivo del presente trabajo es llenar este vacío con respecto a la noción de institución que proporciona fundamentos formales para la aplicación de la metáfora institucional y para su relación con la organización. El resultado principal del documento consiste en mostrar cómo las restricciones abstractas (instituciones) pueden ser paso a paso refinadas a descripciones estructurales concretas (estructuras organizacionales) del sistema implementado, uniendo así la brecha entre las normas abstractas y las especificaciones del sistema de concreto. Concretamente, en la sección 2, se presenta un marco lógico que proporciona una semántica formal para las nociones de institución, norma, papel y que respalda la cuenta de características clave de instituciones como la traducción de normas abstractas a las concretas e implementables, lasEmpoderamiento institucional de los agentes y algunos aspectos del diseño de la aplicación de normas. En la Sección 3, el marco se extiende para tratar la noción de la infraestructura de una institución. El marco extendido se estudia luego en relación con el formalismo para representar las estructuras organizacionales presentadas en [11]. En la Sección 4 siguen algunas conclusiones.2. La teoría social de las instituciones generalmente piensa en las instituciones como las reglas del juego ([18, 23]). Desde un agente de perspectiva, las instituciones son, parafraseando esta cita, las reglas de los diversos juegos que los agentes pueden jugar para interactuar entre sí. Asumir una perspectiva institucional sobre la masa medias, por lo tanto, pensar en la masa en términos normativos: [...] La ley, los sistemas informáticos y muchos otros tipos de estructura organizacional pueden verse como casos de sistemas normativos. Utilizamos el término para referirnos a cualquier conjunto de agentes interactivos cuyo comportamiento puede considerarse de manera útil como gobernado por las normas ([15], p.276). La perspectiva del sistema normativo en las instituciones es, como tal, nada original y ya es una posición bastante reconocida dentro de la comunidad que trabaja en instituciones electrónicas o Einstitutions ([26]). Lo que no se ha investigado y entendido suficientemente con los métodos formales es, en nuestra opinión, la pregunta: ¿qué se pone en el 628 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas para que se ponga en MAS, para ser puesto bajoun conjunto de normas? O en otras palabras: ¿qué significa para un diseñador de una institución de eintitación establecer un conjunto de normas? Avanzamos una tesis precisa sobre este tema, que también se inspira en el trabajo en la teoría social: ahora, como la forma original de producir entidades físicas es la creación, apenas hay una mejor manera de describir la producción de entidades morales que por la palabra imposición[Impositio]. Para las entidades morales no surgen de los principios sustanciales intrínsecos de las cosas, sino que están superadradas a las cosas que ya existen y son físicamente completas ([21], pp. 100-101). Al ignorar por un segundo, la jerga filosófica del siglo XVII podemos extraer fácilmente un mensaje iluminador del extracto: lo que hacen las instituciones es imponer propiedades a las entidades ya existentes. Es decir, las instituciones proporcionan descripciones de entidades mediante el uso de conceptualizaciones que no son apropiadas de las descripciones comunes de esas entidades. Por ejemplo, que los automóviles tienen ruedas es una propiedad objetiva común, mientras que el hecho de que los automóviles cuentan como vehículos en algún sentido legal técnico es una propiedad que la ley impone al concept car. Para decirlo con [25], el hecho de que los automóviles tienen ruedas es un hecho bruto, mientras que el hecho de que los automóviles son vehículos es un hecho institucional. Las instituciones crean descripciones estructuradas de propiedades institucionales con las descripciones brutas de un dominio dado. En este punto, el paso hacia Einstitutions es natural.Einstitutions imponen propiedades en los posibles estados de un MAS: especifican cuáles son los estados en los que un agente I promulga un rol R;¿Cuáles son los estados en los que cierto agente está violando las normas de la institución, etc. Lo hacen mediante la vinculación de algunas propiedades institucionales de los posibles estados y transiciones del sistema (por ejemplo, el agente I promulga el rol R) a algunas propiedades brutas de esos estados y transiciones (por ejemplo, el agente I realiza el Protocolo No.56). Por lo tanto, una propiedad institucional es una propiedad de los estados del sistema o las transiciones del sistema (es decir, un tipo de estado o un tipo de transición) que no pertenece a una descripción meramente técnica o objetiva del sistema. En resumen, la institución se considera como conjuntos de normas (perspectiva del sistema normativo), y las normas se consideran como la imposición de una descripción institucional del sistema en su descripción en términos de propiedades brutas. En pocas palabras, las instituciones son imposiciones de terminologías institucionales sobre las brutas. Las siguientes secciones proporcionan un análisis formal de esta tesis y muestran su poder explicativo en la entrega de una comprensión rigurosa de las características clave de las instituciones. Debido a su idoneidad para representar descripciones de dominio complejas, el marco formal que utilizaremos es el de la lógica de descripción (DL). El uso de dicho formalismo también enfatizará la idea de ver las instituciones como las imposiciones de las descripciones de dominio.2.1 Preliminares: un DL muy expresivo La descripción El lenguaje lógico que permite la expresividad necesaria expande el lenguaje lógico de descripción estándar ALC ([3]) con operadores relacionales (, ◦, ¬, ID) para expresar tipos de transición complejos y jerarquías relacionales (H)expresar la inclusión entre los tipos de transición. Después de una convención de notación común dentro de DL, denotamos este idioma con alch (, ◦, ¬, id). Definición 1. (Sintaxis de Alch (, ◦, ¬, id)) Los tipos de transición y las construcciones de tipo de estado se definen por el siguiente BNF: α: = a |α ◦ α |α α |¬α |id (γ) γ: = c |⊥ |¬γ |γ γ |∀α.γ donde A y C son tipos de transición atómica y, respectivamente, tipos de estado atómico. Vale la pena proporcionar la lectura intuitiva de un par de operadores y las construcciones que acabamos de presentar. En particular, ∀α.γ debe leerse como: después de todas las ejecuciones de transiciones de tipo α, se alcanzan los estados de tipo γ. El operador ◦ denota la concatenación de los tipos de transición. La ID del operador se aplica a una descripción de estado γ y produce una descripción de transición, a saber, la transición que termina en los estados γ. Es la variante lógica de descripción del operador de prueba en lógica dinámica ([5]). Tenga en cuenta que usamos los mismos símbolos y ¬ para denotar a los operadores booleanos de la disyunción y la negación de los tipos de estado y de transición. Los tipos de estado atómico C a menudo son indexados por un identificador de agente I para expresar propiedades de agente (por ejemplo, holandés (i)), y los tipos de transición atómica A a menudo son indexados por un par de identificadores de agentes (i, j) (por ejemplo, pago, pago(i, j)) denotando al actor y, respectivamente, al destinatario de la transición. Al eliminar los identificadores de agente de los tipos de estado y los tipos de transición, obtenemos formularios de tipo de estado (por ejemplo, holandés o rea (r)) y forma de tipo de transición (por ejemplo, pago). Una caja terminológica (en adelante tbox) t = γ, A consiste en un conjunto finito γ de afirmaciones de inclusión de tipo de estado (γ1 γ2), y de un conjunto finito A de afirmaciones de inclusión de tipo de transición (α1 α2). La semántica de alch (, ◦, ¬, id) es teórica del modelo y se da en términos de sistemas de transición interpretados. Como de costumbre, los tipos de estado se interpretan como conjuntos de estados y tipos de transición como conjuntos de pares de estado. Definición 2. (La semántica de alch (, ◦, ¬, id)) Un sistema de transición interpretado m para alch (, ◦, ¬, id) es una estructura s, i donde s es un conjunto de estados no vacío e I esUna función tal que: I (C) ⊆ S I (A) ⊆ S × S I (⊥) = ∅ I (¬γ) = ΔM \\ I (γ) I (γ1 γ2) = I (γ1) ∩ I (γ2)I (∀α.γ) = {s ∈ S |∀t, (s, t) ∈ I (α) ⇒ t ∈ I (γ)} I (α1 α2) = I (α1) ∪ I (α2) I (¬α) = S × S \\ I (α)I (α1 ◦ α2) = {(s, s) |∃s, (s, s) ∈ I (α1) y (s, s) ∈ I (α2)} I (id (γ)) = {(s, s) |s ∈ I (γ)} Un sistema de transición interpretado M es un modelo de una afirmación de inclusión de tipo de estado γ1 γ2 si I (γ1) ⊆ I (γ2). Es un modelo de una afirmación de inclusión de tipo de transición α1 α2 si I (α1) ⊆ I (α2). Un sistema de transición interpretado M es un modelo de un tbox t = γ, a si m es un modelo de cada afirmación de inclusión en γ y A. Observación 1. (Construcciones derivadas) La correspondencia entre la lógica de descripción y la lógica dinámica es bien conocida ([3]). De hecho, el lenguaje presentado en las definiciones 1 y 2 es una variante de notación del lenguaje de la lógica dinámica ([5]) sin el operador de iteración de los tipos de transición. Como consecuencia, algunas construcciones clave aún son definibles en Alch (, ◦, ¬, Id). En particular, utilizaremos la siguiente definición del tipo de transición if-then-else: si γ entonces α1else α2 = (id (γ) ◦ α1) (id (¬γ) ◦ α2). Los operadores booleanos se definen como de costumbre. Volveremos a algunas características de complejidad de esta lógica en la Sección 2.5. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 629 2.2 Instituciones como terminologías hemos confirmado que las instituciones imponen nuevas descripciones del sistema que se formulan en términos de conjuntos de normas. El paso hacia una base formal de esta visión de las instituciones ahora es corto: las normas pueden considerarse axiomas terminológicos e instituciones como conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos, es decir, cajas terminológicas. Una institución puede especificarse como una caja terminológica Ins = γins, AINS, donde cada declaración de inclusión en γins y Ains modela una norma de la institución. Obviamente, no todos los tbox pueden considerarse como una especificación de la institución. En particular, una especificación de la institución INS debe tener una relación lingüística precisa con las descripciones brutas sobre las cuales se especifica la institución. Denotamos mediante LINS el alfabeto no lógico que contiene solo tipos de estado y transición institucional, y por lbrute el alfabeto no lógico que contiene esos tipos tomados para hablar, en cambio, estados brutos y transiciones1. Definición 3. (Instituciones como tboxes) A TBOX INS = γins, AINS es una especificación de la institución si: 1. El alfabeto no lógico en el que se especifica INS contiene elementos de LINS y LBRUTE. En símbolos: l (ins) ⊆ lins ∪ lbrute.2. Existen conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos γbridge ⊆ γins y rescate ⊆ ains de tal manera que el lado izquierdo de estos axiomas es siempre una descripción expresada en Lbrute y en el lado derecho una descripción expresada en LINS, o esos axiomas son definiciones. En símbolos: si γ1 γ2 ∈ γBridge, entonces γ1 ∈ Lbrute y γ2 ∈ Lins o es el caso que también γ2 γ1 ∈ γBridge. La cláusula para Abridge es análoga.3. Los conjuntos restantes de axiomas terminológicos γins \\ γbridge y Ains \\ Abridge se expresan en LINS. En símbolos: L (γins \\ γbridge) ⊆ lins y L (ains \\ Abridge) ⊆ lins. La definición establece que la especificación de una institución debe expresarse en un idioma que incluye términos institucionales y brutos (1);que una parte de la especificación se refiere a una descripción de los simples términos institucionales (3);y que debe haber una parte de la especificación que conecta los términos institucionales con los brutos (2). Axiomas terminológicos en γbridge y acre para formalizar en dl la noción searlean de los recuentos: como condicionales ([25]), es decir, reglas que indican qué tipo de significado da una institución a ciertos hechos y transiciones brutas (por ejemplo, verificar el cuadro n. ° 4 enEl Formulario No.2 cuenta como aceptación de sus datos personales que se utilizarán para fines de investigación). Una teoría formal de las declaraciones de los recuentos-as se ha desarrollado a fondo en una serie de documentos entre los cuales [10, 13]. El contenido técnico del presente documento capitaliza fuertemente ese trabajo. Observe también que, dada la semántica presentada en la definición 2, si las instituciones se pueden especificar a través de tboxes, entonces el significado de tales especificaciones es un conjunto de sistemas de transición interpretados, es decir, los modelos de esos tboxes. Estos sistemas de transiciones pueden considerarse como toda la masa posible que modela la institución especificada. Observación 2. (Lbrute desde la perspectiva de los diseñadores) desde un lenguaje de perspectiva de diseño que Lbrute debe considerarse como el lenguaje en el que un diseñador especificaría un sistema que instancia a una institución determinada2. La definición 3 muestra que para dicha tarea de diseño 1, los símbolos de LINS y LBRUTE se indexarán (especialmente con identificadores de agentes) para agregar algo de azúcar sintáctica.2 Para hacer un ejemplo concreto, el middleware Ameli [7] puede verse como una herramienta de especificación a un nivel de Lbrute.Es necesario especificar formalmente un puente explícito entre los conceptos utilizados en la descripción del sistema real y los conceptos abstractos institucionales. Volveremos a este problema en la Sección 3. 2.3 De las normas abstractas a concretas para ilustrar la definición 3, y mostrar su poder explicativo, un ejemplo sigue que representa un fenómeno esencial de las instituciones. Ejemplo 1. (de normas abstractas a concretas) Considere una institución que se supone que regula el acceso a un conjunto de servicios web públicos. Puede contener la siguiente norma: está prohibido discriminar el acceso sobre la base de la ciudadanía. Supongamos que ahora se debe construir un sistema que cumpla con esta norma. La primera pregunta es: ¿qué significa, en concreto, discriminar sobre la base de la ciudadanía? El diseñador del sistema debe tomar algunas decisiones concretas para interpretar la norma y estas elecciones deben realizarse para que vinculen explícitamente la norma abstracta a su interpretación concreta. El problema puede representarse de la siguiente manera. La norma abstracta se formaliza mediante la Fórmula 1 mediante el uso de una técnica de reducción estándar de las nociones deométicas (ver [16]): la afirmación de que se le prohíbe discriminar sobre la base de la ciudadanía equivale a la declaración después de cada ejecución de una transición de tipoDiscrer (i, j) El sistema siempre termina en un estado de violación. Junto con la norma, también se debe formalizar algunos conocimientos de antecedentes intuitivos sobre la acción de discriminación. Aquí, así como en el resto de los ejemplos en el documento, proporcionamos solo esa parte de la formalización que es estrictamente funcional para mostrar cómo funciona el formalismo en la práctica. Las fórmulas 2 y 3 expresan dos leyes de efecto: si el solicitante J es holandés, entonces, después de todas las ejecuciones de transiciones de discris de tipotener como efecto que no es aceptado. Todas las fórmulas deben leerse como esquemas que determinan un número finito de expresiones de subsunción dependiendo del número de agentes que I, J consideraron.∀DISCR (i, j) .viol ≡ (1) holandés (j) ∀DIScr (i, j) .acceptado (j) (2) ¬Dutch (j) ∀DIScr (i, j). ¬aceptado (j)(3) El resto de los axiomas se refieren a la traducción del tipo de abstracto discr (I, j) a los tipos de transición concreta. La fórmula 4 refina al hacer explícito que un procedimiento preciso if-then-else cuenta como un acto discriminatorio del agente i.Las fórmulas 5 y 6 especifican qué mensajes de I a J cuentan como aceptación y rechazo. Si el diseñador usa tipos de transición envía (msg33, i, j) y envía (msg38, i, j) para la especificación del sistema de concreto, entonces las fórmulas 5 y 6 pueden considerarse como axiomas de puente que conectan nociones pertenecientes al alfabeto institucional (aceptar y rechazar) a los concretos (para enviar mensajes específicos). Finalmente, las fórmulas 7 y 8 indican dos leyes de efecto intuitivo con respecto a los tipos de aceptación (i, j) y rechazar (i, j).Si Dutch (j) entonces acepta (i, j) más rechazar (i, j) disc (i, j) (4) enviar (msg33, i, j) aceptar (i, j) (5) enviar (msg38, i, j) rechazar (i, j) (6) ∀acept (i, j) .accepted (j) ≡ (7) ∀reject (i, j). ¬), Sobre la base de la semántica expuesta en la definición 2, que la siguiente declaración de inclusión concreta posee W.R.T.630 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) La institución especificada: si holandés (j) luego envía (msg33, i, j) más envía (msg38, i, j) disc (i, j) (9) este escenarioejemplifica una característica generalizada de las instituciones humanas que, como se argumenta ampliamente en [10], deberían ser incorporadas por las electrónicas. Los enfoques formales actuales para las instituciones, como Islander [6], no permiten la especificación formal de traducciones explícitas de normas abstractas en las concretas, y se centran solo en las normas que se pueden especificar en el nivel de especificación del sistema concreto. Lo que muestra el ejemplo 1 es que el problema de la abstracto de las normas en las instituciones puede abordarse formalmente y puede recibir una semántica formal precisa. El escenario sugiere que, simplemente modificando un conjunto apropiado de axiomas terminológicos, es posible que el diseñador obtenga una institución diferente simplemente modificando los conjuntos de axiomas de puente sin tocar los axiomas terminológicos expresados solo en el lenguaje institucional Lins. De hecho, es el caso de que un mismo conjunto de normas abstractas se puede traducir a conjuntos diferentes e incluso incompatibles de normas concretas. Sin embargo, esta traducción no puede ser arbitraria ([1]). Ejemplo 2. (traducciones aceptables e inaceptables de normas abstractas) Reconsidere nuevamente el escenario esbozado en el Ejemplo 1. El tipo de transición disc (I, J) se ha traducido a un procedimiento complejo compuesto por tipos de transición concreta. ¿Haría alguna traducción? Considere una especificación de la institución alternativa INS que contiene las fórmulas 1-3 y la siguiente regla de traducción: Pay (J, I, E10) disc (i, j) (10) ¿Sería esta fórmula una traducción aceptable de la norma abstracta expresada en la fórmula 1? El axioma establece que las transiciones donde recibo E10 de J cuenta como transiciones de tipo discr (i, j). No hace falta decir que esto no es intuitivo, porque el tipo de transición abstracto disc (i, j) obedece algunas restricciones conceptuales intuitivas (fórmulas 2 y 3) que todas sus traducciones también deberían obedecer. De hecho, las siguientes inclusiones se mantendrían en INS: holandesa (j) ∀pay (j, i, e10) .aceptada (j) (11) ¬Dutch (j) ∀pay (j, i, e10).(j) (12) De hecho, hay propiedades del tipo de transición Pay (J, I, E10) Mira al menos incómoda: si un agente es holandés que al pagar E10, sería aceptado, mientras que si no fuera holandés el mismoLa acción lo haría no aceptado. El problema es que el significado de pagar no está intuitivamente subsumido por el significado de discriminar. En otras palabras, un tipo de transición Pay (J, I, E10) no produce intuitivamente los efectos que produce un subtipo de discret (i, j). Es, por el contrario, perfectamente intuitivo que la fórmula 9 obedece las limitaciones en las fórmulas 2 y 3, lo que hace, ya que se puede verificar fácilmente por el terreno de la semántica. Vale la pena enfatizar que sin proporcionar una semántica teórica modelo para las reglas de traducción que vinculan las nociones institucionales con las brutas, no sería tan sencillo modelar las limitaciones lógicas a las que están sometidas las traducciones (ejemplo 2). Esta es precisamente la ventaja de ver las reglas de traducción como axiomas terminológicos específicos, es decir, γbridge y Abridge, trabajando como un puente entre dos idiomas (definición 3). En [12], hemos comparado a fondo este enfoque con enfoques como [9] que conciben reglas de traducción como reglas de inferencia. Los dos ejemplos han demostrado cómo nuestro enfoque puede explicar algunas características esenciales de las instituciones. En la siguiente sección se aplica el mismo marco para proporcionar un análisis formal de la noción de rol.2.4 Módulos y roles institucionales Las instituciones de visualización como imposiciones de descripciones institucionales en los estados y transiciones de sistemas permiten analizar la perspectiva del sistema normativo en sí (es decir, las instituciones son conjuntos de normas) a una granularidad más fina. Hemos visto que los axiomas terminológicos que especifican una institución se refieren a descripciones complejas de nuevas nociones institucionales. Algunos de los tipos de estado institucionales que ocurren en la especificación de la institución juegan un papel clave en la estructuración de la especificación de la institución misma. El ejemplo paradigmático en este sentido ([25]) son hechos como el agente I promulga el rol R que se denotará por tipos de estado Rea (i, r). Al afirmar cómo un agente puede promulgar y desactivar un rol R, y qué consecuencias normativas siguen de la promulgación de R, una institución describe las formas esperadas de comportamiento de los agentes y al mismo tiempo abstrae de los agentes concretos que participan en el sistema. Los conjuntos de normas que especifican una institución se pueden agrupar por los tipos de estado REA. Para cada tipo de estado institucional relevante (por ejemplo, rea (i, r)), los axiomas terminológicos que definen una institución, es decir, sus normas, pueden agruparse en conjuntos (posiblemente superpuestos) de tres tipos diferentes: los axiomas que especifican cómo los estados de los estados deSe puede alcanzar ese tipo institucional (por ejemplo, cómo un agente puedo promulgar el rol R);cómo se pueden dejar los estados de ese tipo (por ejemplo, cómo un agente puedo desazar el rol r);¿Y qué tipo de consecuencias institucionales soportan esos estados (por ejemplo, qué derechos y poder adquieren agente que adquiere al promulgar el rol R). Pediendo prestado la terminología del trabajo en la teoría legal e institucional ([23, 25]), estos grupos de normas pueden llamarse, respectivamente, módulos de estatus institutivos, terminativos y de estado. Módulos de estado Llamamos módulos de estado Aquellos conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos que especifican las consecuencias institucionales de la ocurrencia de un estado institucional dado, por ejemplo, el hecho de que el agente I promulga el rol r.Ejemplo 3. (Un módulo de estado para roles) que promulga un papel dentro de una institución tiene algunas consecuencias institucionales que se agrupan bajo la noción de estado: al desempeñar un papel un agente adquiere un estado específico. Algunas de estas consecuencias son deónticas y se refieren a las obligaciones, derechos y permisos bajo los cuales el agente se pone una vez que promulga el papel. Un ejemplo que se refiere a la descripción normativa del estado de un comprador y un vendedor de roles es el siguiente: rea (i, comprador) rea (j, vendedor) ganar oferta (i, j, b) ∀¬pay (i,j, b) .viol (i) (13) Si el agente I promulga el papel del comprador y J el rol del vendedor y gana la oferta B, entonces si no realizo una transición de tipo de pago (i, j, b), es decir,, es decir,No paga a J el precio correspondiente a la oferta B, entonces el sistema termina en un estado que la institución clasifica como un estado de violación con I siendo el infractor. Observe que la Fórmula 13 se formaliza al mismo tiempo una obligación relacionada con el comprador de roles y un derecho relacionado con el vendedor de roles. De particular interés son las consecuencias que atribuyen los poderes a los agentes que promulgan roles específicos: rea (i, comprador) rea (j, vendedor) ∀bid (i, j, b) .bid (i, j, b) (14) Enviar(I, J, MSG49) Oferta (I, J, B) (15) Si el agente I promulga el papel del comprador y J el papel del vendedor, cada vez el agente de Time Bo B a J esta acción da como resultado un estado institucional que testifica que el correspondienteLa oferta ha sido realizada por I (Fórmula 14). La Fórmula 15 establece cómo la acción de licitación se puede ejecutar enviando un mensaje específico a J (Enviar (I, J, MSG49)). Algunas observaciones están en orden. Como los lectores familiarizados con la lógica deóntica probablemente ya hayan notado, nuestro tratamiento de la noción de la sexta intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 631 de obligación (Fórmula 13) hace que el uso de un enfoque de reducción estándar ([16]). Más interesante es cómo se modela la noción de poder institucional. Esencialmente, el fenómeno de empoderamiento se analiza en un término de dos reglas: uno que especifica los efectos institucionales de una acción institucional (Fórmula 14), y otro que traduce el tipo de transición institucional en uno bruto (Fórmula 15). Los sistemas de reglas de este tipo capacitan a los agentes que promulgan algún papel relevante al establecer una conexión entre las acciones brutas de los agentes y algún efecto institucional. Si los agentes realmente pueden ejecutar las acciones brutas requeridas es un problema diferente, ya que el agente puedo estar en algunos estados (o incluso en todos los estados) no puede efectuar una transición de envío (i, j, msg49). Este es el caso también en las sociedades humanas: los sacerdotes están facultados para dar lugar a los matrimonios, pero si un sacerdote no está en el estado de realizar los actos de habla requeridos, en realidad no puede casarse con nadie. Hay una diferencia entre tener derecho a hacer una oferta y estar en el estado de hacer una oferta ([4]). En otras palabras, las fórmulas 14 y 15 expresan solo que los agentes que desempeñan el papel del comprador tienen derecho a hacer ofertas. La posibilidad real de realizar las acciones brutas requeridas no es un problema institucional, sino más bien un problema con respecto a la implementación de una institución en un sistema concreto. Abordamos este problema ampliamente en la Sección 33. Módulos institutivos que llamamos módulos institutos Esos conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos de una especificación de la institución que describe cómo los estados con ciertas propiedades institucionales se pueden llegar, por ejemplo, cómo un agente puedo llegar a un estado en el que promulga el rol r.Pueden ser vistos como procedimientos que la institución define para que los agentes traigan estados institucionales de las cosas. Ejemplo 4. (Un módulo instituto para roles) El hecho de que un agente I promulga un rol R (REA (I, R)) es el efecto de una Acción de Acción de Acción de promulgación correspondiente (I, R) realizada bajo ciertas circunstancias (Fórmula 16), a saber, que el agente aún no promulga el papel, y que el agente satisface las condiciones dadas (cond (i, r)), lo que, por ejemplo, podría pertenecer a las capacidades computacionales requeridas para que un agente desempeñe el papel elegido, o su capacidad parainteractuar con algunas infraestructuras de sistemas específicos. La fórmula 17 especifica en su lugar el contado del procedimiento como una acción de tipo promocionada (i, r). Dicho procedimiento se realiza a través de una infraestructura del sistema, que notifica a I que se ha registrado como promulgación de rol R después de enviar la pieza de datos necesaria d (enviar (i, s, d)), por ejemplo, un número de tarjeta de crédito válido.¬Rea (i, r) cond (i, r) promulga (i, r) .rea (i, r) (16) enviar (i, s, d) ◦ notificar (s, i) promulgar (i, r)(17) Módulos terminativos análogos, llamamos módulos terminativos aquellos conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos que indican cómo se puede dejar un estado con ciertas propiedades institucionales. Reglas de este estado amable, por ejemplo, cómo un agente puede dejar de promulgar un cierto rol. Por lo tanto, pueden considerarse procedimientos que la institución define para que el agente se diga que ciertos estados institucionales dejan de mantener. Ejemplo 5. (un módulo terminativo para roles) módulos terminativos para roles especifican, por ejemplo, cómo se puede ejecutar un tipo de transición desact (i, r) que tiene como consecuencia el alcance de un estado de tipo ¬Rea (i, r): rea (i, r) desact (i, r) .¬rea (i, r) (18) Enviar (i, s, msg9) desact (i, r) (19) es decir, estoy separando un papelr siempre conduce a un estado donde 3 ver en particular el ejemplo 6 y la definición 5 I no promulgan el rol R;y envío el mensaje No.9 a una infraestructura de interfaz específica.Ejemplos 3-5 han demostrado cómo se pueden formalizar los roles en nuestro marco, obteniendo así una semántica formal: los roles también son conjuntos de axiomas terminológicos relacionados con los tipos de estado de la clasificación (i, r). Vale la pena notar que esta opción de modelado está alineada con el trabajo en la teoría social que aborda el concepto de papel como [20].2.5 Especificaciones manejables de instituciones En las secciones anteriores, desplegamos completamente la expresividad del lenguaje introducido en la Sección 2.1 y utilizamos su semántica para proporcionar una comprensión formal de muchos aspectos esenciales de las instituciones en términos de sistemas de transición. Esta sección gasta algunas palabras sobre la viabilidad de realizar un razonamiento automatizado en la lógica presentada. El problema de satisfilidad4 en Logic Alch (, ◦, ¬, ID) es indecidible ya que los axiomas de inclusión del tipo de transición corresponden a una versión de lo que en la descripción se conoce como mapas de valor de rol y lógicas que extienden ALC con mapas de valor de rolindecidible ([3]). Sin embargo, se pueden aislar fragmentos manejables (es decir, tiempo polinomial decidible) de alch lógico (, ◦, ¬, id) que aún exhiben algunas características expresivas clave. Uno de ellos es la lógica elh (◦). Se obtiene de Descripción Logic El, que contiene solo la intersección de tipos de estado, restricción existencial ∃ y 5, pero se extiende con el tipo de estado ⊥ y con los axiomas de inclusión de tipo de transición de una forma compleja: A1 ◦... ° un a (con n número finito). La lógica ELH (◦) también es un fragmento de la descripción bien investigada Logic El ++ cuyo problema de satisfacción se ha demostrado en [2] como decidible en el tiempo polinómico. A pesar de la expresividad muy limitada de este fragmento, algunas especificaciones institucionales rudimentarias aún se pueden representar con éxito. Específicamente, se pueden representar módulos institutos y terminativos que contienen axiomas de inclusión de tipos de transición. Las versiones restringidas de los módulos de estado también se pueden representar que permitan dos nociones deónticas esenciales: es posible (respectivamente, imposible) alcanzar un estado de violación realizando una transición de cierto tipo, y es posible (respectivamente, imposible) alcanzar un legal legalEstado realizando una transición de cierto tipo. A este objetivo, el lenguaje LINS necesitaría ampliarse con un conjunto de tipos de estado {legales (i)} 0≤i≤n cuyo significado intuitivo es denotar los estados legales en lugar de los estados de tipo viol (i). Los fragmentos como ELH (◦) podrían usarse como lógicas objetivo dentro de los enfoques de aproximación de la teoría ([24]) apuntando a compilar tboxes expresados en alch (, ◦, ¬, id) a aproximaciones en esos fragmentos.3. Desde las normas hasta las estructuras 3.1 Infraestructuras En la discusión del Ejemplo 3, observamos cómo tener derecho a hacer una oferta no implica estar en el estado de hacer una oferta. En otras palabras, una institución puede empoderar a los agentes por medio de las reglas apropiadas, pero este empoderamiento puede seguir siendo una letra muerta. Similar 4 Este problema equivale a verificar si una descripción de estado γ es satisfable W.R.T.un tbox t dado, es decir, para verificar si existe un modelo M de t tal que ∅ ⊂ i (γ). Observe que el lenguaje alch (, ◦, ¬, id) contiene negación e intersección de los tipos de estado arbitrarios. Es bien sabido que si estos operadores están disponibles, todas las tareas de razonamiento más típicas a nivel de TBOX pueden reducirse al problema de satisfacción.5 Observe, por lo tanto, EL es un fragmento de ALC seriamente restringido, ya que no contiene el operador de negación para los tipos de estado (los operadores y ∀ siguen siendo indefinibles).632 El sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y las observaciones de sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) se aplican también a las nociones deoípicas: a los agentes se les puede permitir realizar ciertas transacciones en algunas condiciones relevantes, pero podrían no poder hacerlo en esas mismas condiciones. Nos referimos a este tipo de problemas como infraestructura. La implementación de una institución en un sistema concreto llama, por lo tanto, para el diseño de infraestructuras o artefactos apropiados ([19]). La especificación formal de una infraestructura equivale a la especificación formal de los requisitos de interacción, es decir, la especificación de las cuales los tipos de transición relevantes son ejecutables y en qué condiciones. Definición 4. (Infraestructuras como tboxes) Una infraestructura Inf = γInf, Ainf para la institución INS es un tbox en Lbrute de tal manera que para todos los a ∈ L (acre) existen axiomas terminológicos en γInf de la siguiente forma: γ ≡ ∃a.(A es ejecutable exactamente en estados γ) y γ ≡ ∃¬A.(La negación de A es ejecutable exactamente en los estados γ). En otras palabras, una especificación de infraestructura establece todas y solo las condiciones bajo las cuales un tipo de transición bruta atómica y su negación son ejecutables, que ocurren en el alfabeto bruto de los axiomas del puente de INS. Establece lo que puede estar en concreto y bajo qué condiciones. Ejemplo 6. (Especificación de infraestructura) Considere la institución especificada en el Ejemplo 1. Una infraestructura simple para esa institución podría contener, por ejemplo, los siguientes axiomas terminológicos para cualquier par de agentes diferentes I, J y Tipo de mensaje MSG: ∃send (MSG33, I, J).(20) La fórmula establece que siempre está en las posibilidades del Agente I enviar el mensaje No. 33 al Agente J. Luego sigue por el ejemplo del ejemplo 1 que el agente siempre puedo aceptar el agente j.∃acept (i, j).(21) Observe que la condición de ejecución es justa. Llamamos a una especificación de la institución concreta CINS una especificación de la institución INS junto con una especificación de infraestructura Inf. Definición 5. (Institución concreta) Una institución concreta obtenida al unirse a la institución INS = γins, AINS y la infraestructura INF = γInf, Ainf es un tbox cins = γ, tal que γ = γins ∪ γinf y A = ains ∪ ainf. Obviamente, se pueden idear diferentes infraestructuras para una misma institución que da lugar a diferentes instituciones concretas que hace que las elecciones de implementación precisas explícitas. De particular relevancia son las opciones de implementación sobre normas abstractas como la representada en la Fórmula 13. Un diseñador puede optar por reglamentar dicha norma ([15]), es decir, hacer que los estados de violación no sean inalcarios, a través de una infraestructura apropiada. Ejemplo 7. (Regimen a través de la especificación de infraestructura) Considere el Ejemplo 3 y suponga que la siguiente regla de traducción también es parte de la institución: Bnk (I, J, B) CC (i, J, B) ≡ Pay (I, J, B) (22) PAGO DE CONDICIÓN (I, J, B) ≡ Rea (I, Comprador) Rea (J, Vendedor) BID de ganancia (I, J, B) (23) La primera fórmula establece cómo el pago se puede llevar a cabo concretamente(a través de la transferencia bancaria o la tarjeta de crédito) y el segundo solo proporciona una etiqueta concreta que agrupa los tipos de estado institucional relevantes para la norma. Para especificar una regación en el nivel de infraestructura, es suficiente indicar que: el pago de la condición (i, j, b) ≡ ∃ (bnk (i, j, b) cc (i, j, b)).(24) ¬Condition Pay (i, j, b) ≡ ∃¬ (bnk (i, j, b) cc (i, j, b)).(25) En otras palabras, en los estados de la condición de tipo de pago (i, j, b) las únicas acciones brutas ejecutables son el banco (i, j, b) o cc (i, j, b) y, por lo tanto, el pago (i, j, b) se ejecutaría necesariamente. Como resultado, la siguiente inclusión no se mantiene con respecto a la institución concreta correspondiente: paga de condición (i, j, b) ∃¬pay (i) .viol (i).3.2 Estructuras organizativas Esta sección resume y adapta brevemente la perspectiva y los resultados de las estructuras organizacionales presentadas en [14, 11]. Nos referimos a ese trabajo para una exposición más completa. Las estructuras organizacionales generalmente se refieren a la forma en que los agentes interactúan dentro de las organizaciones. Estas interacciones se pueden representar como los enlaces de un gráfico definidos en el conjunto de roles de la organización. Dichos enlaces deben ser etiquetados sobre la base del tipo de interacción que representan. En primer lugar, debe quedar claro si un enlace denota que una cierta interacción entre dos roles puede o debería tener lugar, o puede, etc. En segundo lugar, los enlaces deben etiquetarse de acuerdo con el tipo de transición α a las que se refieren y las condiciones γ en las que esa transición puede, debe tener lugar, etc. Los enlaces en una especificación formal de una estructura organizacional se encuentran, por lo tanto, para declaraciones del tipo: el rol R puede (debe, puede, puede ejecutar α W.R.T.rol s si γ es el caso. En aras de la simplicidad, la siguiente definición considerará solo la lata y las modalidades de interacción. Los tipos de estado y de transición en Lins ∪lBrute se utilizarán para etiquetar los enlaces de la estructura. Por lo tanto, las modalidades de interacción pueden ser de un tipo institucional o de un tipo bruto. Definición 6. (Estructura organizacional) Una estructura organizacional es un múltiple: OS = roles, {cp} p∈Mod, {op} p∈Mod donde: • mod denota un conjunto de pares p = γ: α, es decir, un conjunto de pares de tipo de estado (condición) y tipo de transición (acción) de lins∪lbrute con α como un tipo de transición atómica indexado con un par (i, j) que denota marcadores de posición para el actor y el destinatario de la transición;• C (CAN) denota los enlaces que se interpretarán en términos de la ejecución de la α relacionada en γ, mientras que O (Ought) denota los enlaces que se interpretarán en términos de la obligación de ejecutar el α relacionado en γ. Por las expresiones (R, S) ∈ Cγ: α y (R, S) ∈ Oγ: α queremos decir, por lo tanto: los agentes que promulgan el rol R pueden, respectivamente, deben interactuar con los agentes que promulgan el rol S realizando α en estados de tipoγ. Como se muestra en [11] tales representaciones formales de estructuras organizacionales son de uso para investigar las propiedades estructurales (robustez, flexibilidad, etc.) que exhibe una organización determinada. En este punto, se establecen todos los medios formales que nos permiten representar formalmente a las instituciones, así como a las estructuras organizacionales. El siguiente y último paso del trabajo consiste en proporcionar una relación formal entre los dos marcos. Esta relación formal hará explícita cómo las instituciones están relacionadas con las estructuras organizacionales y viceversa. En particular, quedará claro cómo una concepción normativa de la noción de rol se relaciona con uno estructural, es decir, cómo la visión de los roles como un conjunto de normas (que especifica cómo un agente puede promulgar y desactivar el papel, y qué socialEstado que obtiene haciendo eso) se relaciona con la visión de los roles como posiciones dentro de las estructuras sociales.3.3 Relacionar las instituciones con las organizaciones el sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 633 para traducir una institución concreta dada en una estructura organizacional correspondiente, necesitamos una función t que asigne pares de roles a los axiomas. Denotemos con el conjunto de todas las declaraciones de inclusión de tipo de estado γ1 γ2 que se pueden expresar en LINS ∪ LBRUTE. La función t es una función parcial sub roles × roles tal que, para cualquier x ∈ Sub si x = rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∃α.(ejecución) o x = rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol (i) (obligación) luego t (x) = (r, s), donde α es un tipo de transición atómicaindexado con un par (i, j). Es decir, las leyes de ejecución y obligación de ejecución que contienen la configuración de promulgación rea (i, r) rea (j, s) como una premisa y en relación con la transición de los tipos α, con el actor I y el receptor de la transición α, se traducen en papelpares (R, S). Definición 7. (Correspondencia de especificaciones) Una institución concreta cins = γ, A se dice que corresponde a una estructura organizacional OS (y viceversa) si, por cada x ∈ γ: • x = rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∃α.iff t (x) ∈ Cγ: α • x = rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol (i) iff t (x) ∈ Oγ: α intuitivamente, la función t toma axioms de γ(es decir, el conjunto de axiomas terminológicos de tipo estado de CIN) y produce pares de roles. Definición 7 Etiquetas Los pares arrojados en consecuencia a la forma sintáctica de los axiomas traducidos. Más concretamente, axiomas de la forma rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∃α.(Las leyes de ejecución) se traducen al par (R, S) perteneciente a la dimensión de ejecución (es decir, c) de la estructura organizacional W.R.T.La ejecución de α en circunstancias γ.Analógicamente, los axiomas de la forma rea (i, r) rea (j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol (i) (leyes de obligación) se traducen al par (r, s) perteneciente a la dimensión de obligación (es decir, o, o) de la estructura organizacional W.R.T.La ejecución de α en circunstancias γ. Dejando los tecnicismos a un lado, la función T destila así las restricciones terminológicas e infraestructurales de los CIN en los estructurales. Los módulos institutivos, terminativos y de estado de los roles se traducen en definiciones de posiciones dentro de un sistema operativo. Desde una perspectiva de diseño, la interpretación de la definición 7 es doble. Por un lado (de izquierda a derecha), puede hacer explícito cuáles son las consecuencias estructurales de una institución determinada respaldada por una infraestructura dada. Por otro lado (de derecha a izquierda), puede hacer explícito qué tipo de institución realmente es implementada por una estructura organizacional determinada. Veamos esto en algunos detalles más. Dada una institución concreta CINS, la definición 7 permite que un diseñador sea consciente del impacto que las elecciones terminológicas específicas (en particular, la elección de ciertos axiomas de puente) y las infraestructurales tienen a nivel estructural. Observe que la definición 7 admite la inferencia de enlaces en una estructura. Al verificar si una declaración de inclusión dada de la forma sintáctica relevante se deduce de CINS (es decir, el llamado problema de subsunción de DL) es posible, a través de T, agregar nuevos enlaces a la estructura organizativa correspondiente. Esto se puede hacer recursivamente simplemente agregando cualquier nueva inclusión inferida X al conjunto anterior de axiomas γ, obteniendo así una especificación institucional actualizada que contiene γ ∪ {x}. Este proceso puede considerarse como la inferencia de los vínculos estructurales a partir de las especificaciones institucionales. En otras palabras, es posible utilizar las especificaciones de la institución como herramientas de inferencia para especificaciones estructurales. Por ejemplo, la elección de infraestructura formalizada en el Ejemplo 7 implica que para el par de roles (comprador, vendedor), siempre es el caso que (comprador, vendedor) ∈ C: paga (i, j, b). Este enlace se deduce de los enlaces (comprador, vendedor) ∈ C: bnk (i, j, b) y (comprador, vendedor) ∈ C: cc (i, j, b) en los axiomas del puente de la institución (fórmula22). Supongamos que ahora un diseñador está interesado en un sistema que, además de implementar una institución, también incorpore una estructura organizativa que disfruta de propiedades estructurales deseables como flexibilidad o robustez6. Por lo tanto, al relacionar los enlaces estructurales con las inclusiones de tipo de estado, es posible verificar si agregar un enlace en el sistema operativo da como resultado una especificación institucional más fuerte, es decir, si la declaración de inclusión correspondiente ya no está implícita con INS. Para dibujar un paralelismo con lo que acaba de decir en el párrafo anterior, este proceso puede considerarse como la inferencia de normas y limitaciones de infraestructura a partir de la especificación de estructuras organizacionales. Para dar un ejemplo simple, considere nuevamente el ejemplo 6 pero desde una perspectiva invertida. Supongamos que un diseñador quiere un gráfico totalmente conectado en la dimensión C: Enviar (i, j) de la estructura organizacional. Explotando la definición 7, obtendríamos una serie de leyes de ejecución de la manera de la fórmula 20 para todos los roles en los roles (por lo tanto, 2 | roles | axiomas). La definición 7 establece una correspondencia entre dos perspectivas esencialmente diferentes sobre el diseño de sistemas abiertos que permiten que se analicen formalmente la retroalimentación entre los dos. Una última observación está en orden. Si bien dada una institución concreta, una estructura organizativa puede especificarse en principio (al verificar todas las declaraciones de inclusión relevantes, ya sea implícita o no por la institución), no es posible obtener una especificación terminológica completa de una organización de una organizaciónestructura. Esto se encuentra en el hecho de que en la definición 6 la información estrictamente terminológica contenida en la especificación de una institución (eminentemente, el conjunto de axiomas de tipo de transición a y, por lo tanto, los axiomas del puente) se pierde mientras se mueve a una descripción estructural. Esto muestra, a su vez, que el valor agregado de la especificación de las instituciones se encuentra precisamente en el enlace terminológico que establecen entre las nociones institucionales y brutas, es decir, a nivel del sistema.4. Conclusiones El documento tenía como objetivo proporcionar un análisis formal integral de la metáfora institucional y su relación con la organización. La herramienta formal predominante ha sido la lógica de descripción. Tboxes se ha utilizado para representar las especificaciones de las instituciones (definición 3) y sus infraestructuras (definición 6), proporcionando por lo tanto una semántica del sistema de transición para una serie de nociones institucionales (ejemplos 1-7). Los múltiples grifos se han utilizado para representar la especificación de estructuras organizacionales (definición 6). El último resultado presentado se refería a la definición de una correspondencia formal entre las especificaciones de la institución y la organización (Definición 7), que proporciona una forma formal de cambiar entre los dos paradigmas. En general, estos resultados ofrecen una forma para relacionar las especificaciones del sistema abstracto (es decir, las instituciones como conjuntos de normas) con especificaciones que están más cerca de un sistema implementado (es decir, estructuras organizativas).5.

        "Meyer Utrecht University PO Box 80.089, 3508TB Utrecht, The Netherlands jj@cs.uu.nl ABSTRACT Up to now, the way institutions and organizations have been used in the development of open systems has not often gone further than a useful heuristics.",
        "In order to develop systems actually implementing institutions and organizations, formal methods should take the place of heuristic ones.",
        "The paper presents a formal semantics for the notion of institution and its components (abstract and concrete norms, empowerment of agents, roles) and defines a formal relation between institutions and organizational structures.",
        "As a result, it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented system.",
        "It is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors F.4.1 [Mathematical Logic and Formal Languages]: Modal Logic; I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Multiagent Systems; F.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Coherence and Coordination General Terms Theory. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of organizational and social theory to distributed AI and multiagent systems (MASs) has long been advocated ([8]).",
        "In MASs the application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system design has proven to be useful for the development of methodologies and tools.",
        "In many cases, however, the application of these conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high level design of the systems.",
        "It is our thesis that the application of those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure, etc. obtain a formal semantics.",
        "This has been the case for agent programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.) have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]).",
        "As a matter of fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures and programming languages.",
        "What is lacking at the moment for the design and development of open MASs is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that BDI-like formalisms have played for the design and development of single-agent architectures.",
        "Aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one.",
        "The main result of the paper consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.",
        "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",
        "In Section 3 the framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution.",
        "The extended framework is then studied in relation to the formalism for representing organizational structures presented in [11].",
        "In Section 4 some conclusions follow. 2.",
        "INSTITUTIONS Social theory usually thinks of institutions as the rules of the game ([18, 23]).",
        "From an agent perspective institutions are, to paraphrase this quote, the rules of the various games agents can play in order to interact with one another.",
        "To assume an institutional perspective on MASs means therefore to think of MASs in normative terms: [. . . ] law, computer systems, and many other kinds of organizational structure may be viewed as instances of normative systems.",
        "We use the term to refer to any set of interacting agents whose behavior can usefully be regarded as governed by norms ([15], p.276).",
        "The normative system perspective on institutions is, as such, nothing original and it is already a quite acknowledged position within the community working on electronic institutions, or eInstitutions ([26]).",
        "What has not been sufficiently investigated and understood with formal methods is, in our view, the question: what does it 628 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS amount to, for a MAS, to be put under a set of norms?",
        "Or in other words: what does it mean for a designer of an eInstitution to state a set of norms?",
        "We advance a precise thesis on this issue, which is also inspired by work in social theory: Now, as the original manner of producing physical entities is creation, there is hardly a better way to describe the production of moral entities than by the word imposition [impositio].",
        "For moral entities do not arise from the intrinsic substantial principles of things but are superadded to things already existent and physically complete ([21], pp. 100-101).",
        "By ignoring for a second the philosophical jargon of the Seventeenth century we can easily extract an illuminating message from the excerpt: what institutions do is to impose properties on already existing entities.",
        "That is to say, institutions provide descriptions of entities by making use of conceptualizations that are not proper of the common descriptions of those entities.",
        "For example, that cars have wheels is a common factual property, whereas the fact that cars count as vehicles in some technical legal sense is a property that law imposes on the concept car.",
        "To say it with [25], the fact that cars have wheels is a brute fact, while the fact that cars are vehicles is an institutional fact.",
        "Institutions build structured descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a given domain.",
        "At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc.",
        "They do this via linking some institutional properties of the possible states and transitions of the system (e.g., agent i enacts role r) to some brute properties of those states and transitions (e.g., agent i performs protocol No.56).",
        "An institutional property is therefore a property of system states or system transitions (i.e., a state type or a transition type) that does not belong to a merely technical, or factual, description of the system.",
        "To sum up, institution are viewed as sets of norms (normative system perspective), and norms are thought of as the imposition of an institutional description of the system upon its description in terms of brute properties.",
        "In a nutshell, institutions are impositions of institutional terminologies upon brute ones.",
        "The following sections provide a formal analysis of this thesis and show its explanatory power in delivering a rigorous understanding of key features of institutions.",
        "Because of its suitability for representing complex domain descriptions, the formal framework we will make use of is the one of Description Logics (DL).",
        "The use of such formalism will also stress the idea of viewing institutions as the impositions of domain descriptions. 2.1 Preliminaries: a very expressive DL The description logic language enabling the necessary expressivity expands the standard description logic language ALC ([3]) with relational operators ( ,◦,¬,id) to express complex transition types, and relational hierarchies (H) to express inclusion between transition types.",
        "Following a notational convention common within DL we denote this language with ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) .",
        "DEFINITION 1. (Syntax of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) ) transition types and state type constructs are defined by the following BNF: α := a | α ◦ α | α α | ¬α | id(γ) γ := c | ⊥ | ¬γ | γ γ | ∀α.γ where a and c are atomic transition types and, respectively, atomic state types.",
        "It is worth providing the intuitive reading of a couple of the operators and the constructs just introduced.",
        "In particular ∀α.γ has to be read as: after all executions of transitions of type α, states of type γ are reached.",
        "The operator ◦ denotes the concatenation of transition types.",
        "The operator id applies to a state description γ and yields a transition description, namely, the transition ending in γ states.",
        "It is the description logic variant of the test operator in Dynamic Logic ([5]).",
        "Notice that we use the same symbols and ¬ for denoting the boolean operators of disjunction and negation of both state and transition types.",
        "Atomic state types c are often indexed by an agent identifier i in order to express agent properties (e.g., dutch(i)), and atomic transition types a are often indexed by a pair of agent identifiers (i, j) (e.g., PAY(i, j)) denoting the actor and, respectively, the recipient of the transition.",
        "By removing the agent identifiers from state types and transition types we obtain state type forms (e.g., dutch or rea(r)) and transition type form (e.g., PAY).",
        "A terminological box (henceforth TBox) T = Γ, A consists of a finite set Γ of state type inclusion assertions (γ1 γ2), and of a finite set A of transition type inclusion assertions (α1 α2).",
        "The semantics of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is model theoretical and it is given in terms of interpreted transition systems.",
        "As usual, state types are interpreted as sets of states and transition types as sets of state pairs.",
        "DEFINITION 2. (Semantics of ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) ) An interpreted transition system m for ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is a structure S, I where S is a non-empty set of states and I is a function such that: I(c) ⊆ S I(a) ⊆ S × S I(⊥) = ∅ I(¬γ) = Δm\\ I(γ) I(γ1 γ2) = I(γ1) ∩ I(γ2) I(∀α.γ) = {s ∈ S | ∀t, (s, t) ∈ I(α) ⇒ t ∈ I(γ)} I(α1 α2) = I(α1) ∪ I(α2) I(¬α) = S × S \\ I(α) I(α1 ◦ α2) = {(s, s ) | ∃s , (s, s ) ∈ I(α1) & (s , s ) ∈ I(α2)} I(id(γ)) = {(s, s) | s ∈ I(γ)} An interpreted transition system m is a model of a state type inclusion assertion γ1 γ2 if I(γ1) ⊆ I(γ2).",
        "It is a model of a transition type inclusion assertion α1 α2 if I(α1) ⊆ I(α2).",
        "An interpreted transition system m is a model of a TBox T = Γ, A if m is a model of each inclusion assertion in Γ and A.",
        "REMARK 1. (Derived constructs) The correspondence between description logic and dynamic logic is well-known ([3]).",
        "In fact, the language presented in Definitions 1 and 2 is a notational variant of the language of Dynamic Logic ([5]) without the iteration operator of transition types.",
        "As a consequence, some key constructs are still definable in ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) .",
        "In particular we will make use of the following definition of the if-then-else transition type: if γ then α1else α2 = (id(γ) ◦ α1) (id(¬γ) ◦ α2).",
        "Boolean operators are defined as usual.",
        "We will come back to some complexity features of this logic in Section 2.5.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 629 2.2 Institutions as terminologies We have upheld that institutions impose new system descriptions which are formulated in terms of sets of norms.",
        "The step toward a formal grounding of this view of institutions is now short: norms can be thought of as terminological axioms, and institutions as sets of terminological axioms, i.e., terminological boxes.",
        "An institution can be specified as a terminological box Ins = Γins, Ains , where each inclusion statement in Γins and Ains models a norm of the institution.",
        "Obviously, not every TBox can be considered to be an institution specification.",
        "In particular, an institution specification Ins must have some precise linguistic relationship with the brute descriptions upon which the institution is specified.",
        "We denote by Lins the non-logical alphabet containing only institutional state and transition types, and by Lbrute the nonlogical alphabet containing those types taken to talk about, instead, brute states and transitions1 .",
        "DEFINITION 3. (Institutions as TBoxes) A TBox Ins = Γins, Ains is an institution specification if: 1.",
        "The non-logical alphabet on which Ins is specified contains elements of both Lins and Lbrute.",
        "In symbols: L(Ins) ⊆ Lins ∪ Lbrute. 2.",
        "There exist sets of terminological axioms Γbridge ⊆ Γins and Abridge ⊆ Ains such that either the left-hand side of these axioms is always a description expressed in Lbrute and the right-hand side a description expressed in Lins, or those axioms are definitions.",
        "In symbols: if γ1 γ2 ∈ Γbridge then either γ1 ∈ Lbrute and γ2 ∈ Lins or it is the case that also γ2 γ1 ∈ Γbridge.",
        "The clause for Abridge is analogous. 3.",
        "The remaining sets of terminological axioms Γins\\Γbridge and Ains\\Abridge are all expressed in Lins.",
        "In symbols: L(Γins\\Γbridge) ⊆ Lins and L(Ains\\Abridge) ⊆ Lins.",
        "The definition states that an institution specification needs to be expressed on a language including institutional as well as brute terms (1); that a part of the specification concerns a description of mere institutional terms (3); and that there needs to be a part of the specification which connects institutional terms to brute ones (2).",
        "Terminological axioms in Γbridge and Abridge formalize in DL the Searlean notion of counts-as conditional ([25]), that is, rules stating what kind of meaning an institution gives to certain brute facts and transitions (e.g., checking box No.4 in form No.2 counts as accepting your personal data to be used for research purposes).",
        "A formal theory of counts-as statements has been thoroughly developed in a series of papers among which [10, 13].",
        "The technical content of the present paper heavily capitalizes on that work.",
        "Notice also that given the semantics presented in Definition 2, if institutions can be specified via TBoxes then the meaning of such specifications is a set of interpreted transition systems, i.e., the models of those TBoxes.",
        "These transitions systems can be in turn thought of as all the possible MASs which model the specified institution.",
        "REMARK 2. (Lbrute from a designers perspective) From a design perspective language Lbrute has to be thought of as the language on which a designer would specify a system instantiating a given institution2 .",
        "Definition 3 shows that for such a design task 1 Symbols from Lins and Lbrute will be indexed (especially with agent identifiers) to add some syntactic sugar. 2 To make a concrete example, the AMELI middleware [7] can be viewed as a specification tool at a Lbrute level. it is needed to formally specify an explicit bridge between the concepts used in the description of the actual system and the institutional abstract concepts.",
        "We will come back to this issue in Section 3. 2.3 From abstract to concrete norms To illustrate Definition 3, and show its explanatory power, an example follows which depicts an essential phenomenon of institutions.",
        "EXAMPLE 1. (From abstract to concrete norms) Consider an institution supposed to regulate access to a set of public web services.",
        "It may contain the following norm: it is forbidden to discriminate access on the basis of citizenship.",
        "Suppose now a system has to be built which complies with this norm.",
        "The first question is: what does it mean, in concrete, to discriminate on the basis of citizenship?",
        "The system designer should make some concrete choices for interpreting the norm and these choices should be kept track of in order to explicitly link the abstract norm to its concrete interpretation.",
        "The problem can be represented as follows.",
        "The abstract norm is formalized by Formula 1 by making use of a standard reduction technique of deontic notions (see [16]): the statement it is forbidden to discriminate on the basis of citizenship amounts to the statement after every execution of a transition of type DISCR(i, j) the system always ends up in a violation state.",
        "Together with the norm also some intuitive background knowledge about the discrimination action needs to be formalized.",
        "Here, as well as in the rest of the examples in the paper, we provide just that part of the formalization which is strictly functional to show how the formalism works in practice.",
        "Formulae 2 and 3 express two effect laws: if the requester j is Dutch then after all executions of transitions of type DISCR(i, j) j is accepted by i, whereas if it is not all the executions of the transitions of the same type have as an effect that it is not accepted.",
        "All formulae have to be read as schemata determining a finite number of subsumption expressions depending on the number of agents i, j considered. ∀DISCR(i, j).viol ≡ (1) dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).accepted(j) (2) ¬dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).¬accepted(j) (3) The rest of the axioms concern the translation of the abstract type DISCR(i, j) to concrete transition types.",
        "Formula 4 refines it by making explicit that a precise if-then-else procedure counts as a discriminatory act of agent i. Formulae 5 and 6 specify which messages of i to j count as acceptance and rejection.",
        "If the designer uses transition types SEND(msg33, i, j) and SEND(msg38, i, j) for the concrete system specification, then Formulae 5 and 6 can be thought of as bridge axioms connecting notions belonging to the institutional alphabet (to accept, and to reject) to concrete ones (to send specific messages).",
        "Finally, Formulae 7 and 8 state two intuitive effect laws concerning the ACCEPT(i, j) and REJECT(i, j) types. if dutch(j)then ACCEPT(i, j) else REJECT(i, j) DISCR(i, j) (4) SEND(msg33, i, j) ACCEPT(i, j) (5) SEND(msg38, i, j) REJECT(i, j) (6) ∀ACCEPT(i, j).accepted(j) ≡ (7) ∀REJECT(i, j).¬accepted(j) ≡ (8) It is easy to see, on the grounds of the semantics exposed in Definition 2, that the following concrete inclusion statement holds w.r.t. 630 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) the specified institution: if dutch(j) then SEND(msg33, i, j) else SEND(msg38, i, j) DISCR(i, j) (9) This scenario exemplifies a pervasive feature of human institutions which, as extensively argued in [10], should be incorporated by electronic ones.",
        "Current formal approaches to institutions, such as ISLANDER [6], do not allow for the formal specification of explicit translations of abstract norms into concrete ones, and focus only on norms that can be specified at the concrete system specification level.",
        "What Example 1 shows is that the problem of the abstractness of norms in institutions can be formally addressed and can be given a precise formal semantics.",
        "The scenario suggests that, just by modifying an appropriate set of terminological axioms, it is possible for the designer to obtain a different institution by just modifying the sets of bridge axioms without touching the terminological axioms expressed only in the institutional language Lins.",
        "In fact, it is the case that a same set of abstract norms can be translated to different and even incompatible sets of concrete norms.",
        "This translation can nevertheless not be arbitrary ([1]).",
        "EXAMPLE 2. (Acceptable and unacceptable translations of abstract norms) Reconsider again the scenario sketched in Example 1.",
        "The transition type DISCR(i, j) has been translated to a complex procedure composed by concrete transition types.",
        "Would any translation do?",
        "Consider an alternative institution specification Ins containing Formulae 1-3 and the following translation rule: PAY(j, i, e10) DISCR(i, j) (10) Would this formula be an acceptable translation of the abstract norm expressed in Formula 1?",
        "The axiom states that transitions where i receives e10 from j count as transitions of type DISCR(i, j).",
        "Needless to say this is not intuitive, because the abstract transition type DISCR(i, j) obeys some intuitive conceptual constraints (Formulae 2 and 3) that all its translations should also obey.",
        "In fact, the following inclusions would then hold in Ins : dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).accepted(j) (11) ¬dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).¬accepted(j) (12) In fact, there properties of the transition type PAY(j, i, e10) look at least awkward: if an agent is Dutch than by paying e10 it would be accepted, while if it was not Dutch the same action would make it not accepted.",
        "The problem is that the meaning of paying is not intuitively subsumed by the meaning of discriminating.",
        "In other words, a transition type PAY(j, i, e10) does not intuitively yield the effects that a sub-type of DISCR(i, j) yields.",
        "It is on the contrary perfectly intuitive that Formula 9 obeys the constraints in Formulae 2 and 3, which it does, as it can be easily checked on the grounds of the semantics.",
        "It is worth stressing that without providing a model-theoretic semantics for the translation rules linking the institutional notions to the brute ones, it would not be so straightforward to model the logical constraints to which the translations are subjected (Example 2).",
        "This is precisely the advantage of viewing translation rules as specific terminological axioms, i.e., Γbridge and Abridge, working as a bridge between two languages (Definition 3).",
        "In [12], we have thoroughly compared this approach with approaches such as [9] which conceive of translation rules as inference rules.",
        "The two examples have shown how our approach can account for some essential features of institutions.",
        "In the next section the same framework is applied to provide a formal analysis of the notion of role. 2.4 Institutional modules and roles Viewing institutions as the impositions of institutional descriptions on systems states and transitions allows for analyzing the normative system perspective itself (i.e., institutions are sets of norms) at a finer granularity.",
        "We have seen that the terminological axioms specifying an institution concern complex descriptions of new institutional notions.",
        "Some of the institutional state types occurring in the institution specification play a key role in structuring the specification of the institution itself.",
        "The paradigmatic example in this sense ([25]) are facts such as agent i enacts role r which will be denoted by state types rea(i, r).",
        "By stating how an agent can enact and deact a role r, and what normative consequences follow from the enactment of r, an institution describes expected forms of agents behavior while at the same time abstracting from the concrete agents taking part to the system.",
        "The sets of norms specifying an institution can be clustered on the grounds of the rea state types.",
        "For each relevant institutional state type (e.g., rea(i, r)), the terminological axioms which define an institution, i.e., its norms, can be clustered in (possibly overlapping) sets of three different types: the axioms specifying how states of that institutional type can be reached (e.g., how an agent i can enact the role r); how states of that type can be left (e.g., how an agent i can deact the a role r); and what kind of institutional consequences do those states bear (e.g., what rights and power does agent i acquire by enacting role r).",
        "Borrowing the terminology from work in legal and institutional theory ([23, 25]), these clusters of norms can be called, respectively, institutive, terminative and status modules.",
        "Status modules We call status modules those sets of terminological axioms which specify the institutional consequences of the occurrence of a given institutional state-of-affairs, for instance, the fact that agent i enacts role r. EXAMPLE 3. (A status module for roles) Enacting a role within an institution bears some institutional consequences that are grouped under the notion of status: by playing a role an agent acquires a specific status.",
        "Some of these consequences are deontic and concern the obligations, rights, permissions under which the agent puts itself once it enacts the role.",
        "An example which pertains to the normative description of the status of both a buyer and a seller roles is the following: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) ∀¬PAY(i, j, b).viol(i) (13) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role and i wins bid b then if i does not perform a transition of type PAY (i, j, b), i.e., does not pay to j the price corresponding to bid b, then the system ends up in a state that the institution classifies as a violation state with i being the violator.",
        "Notice that Formula 13 formalizes at the same time an obligation pertaining to the role buyer and a right pertaining to the role seller.",
        "Of particular interest are then those consequences that attribute powers to agents enacting specific roles: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) ∀BID(i, j, b).bid(i, j, b) (14) SEND(i, j, msg49) BID(i, j, b) (15) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role, every time agent i bids b to j this action results in an institutional state testifying that the corresponding bid has been placed by i (Formula 14).",

        "Essentially, the empowerment phenomenon is analyzed in term of two rules: one specifying the institutional effects of an institutional action (Formula 14), and one translating the institutional transition type in a brute one (Formula 15).",
        "Systems of rules of this type empower the agents enacting some relevant role by establishing a connection between the brute actions of the agents and some institutional effect.",
        "Whether the agents are actually able to execute the required brute actions is a different issue, since agent i can be in some states (or even all states) unable to effectuate a SEND(i, j, msg49) transition.",

        "There is a difference between being entitled to make a bid and being in state of making a bid ([4]).",
        "In other words, Formulae 14 and 15 express only that agents playing the buyer role are entitled to make bids.",
        "The actual possibility of performing the required brute actions is not an institutional issue, but rather an issue concerning the implementation of an institution in a concrete system.",
        "We address this issue extensively in Section 33 .",
        "Institutive modules We call institutive modules those sets of terminological axioms of an institution specification describing how states with certain institutional properties can be reached, for instance, how an agent i can reach a state in which it enacts role r. They can be seen as procedures that the institution define in order for the agents to bring institutional states of affairs about.",
        "EXAMPLE 4. (An institutive module for roles) The fact that an agent i enacts a role r (rea(i, r)) is the effect of a corresponding enactment action ENACT(i, r) performed under certain circumstances (Formula 16), namely that the agent does not already enact the role, and that the agent satisfies given conditions (cond(i, r)), which might for instance pertain the computational capabilities required for an agent to play the chosen role, or its capability to interact with some specific systems infrastructures.",

        "Rules of this kind state for instance how an agent can stop enacting a certain role.",
        "They can be thus thought of as procedures that the institution defines in order for the agent to see to it that certain institutional states stop holding.",
        "EXAMPLE 5. (A terminative module for roles) Terminative modules for roles specify, for instance, how a transition type DEACT(i, r) can be executed which has as consequence the reaching of a state of type ¬rea(i, r): rea(i, r) DEACT(i, r).¬rea(i, r) (18) SEND(i, s, msg9) DEACT(i, r) (19) That is to say, i deacting a role r always leads to a state where 3 See in particular Example 6 and Definition 5 i does not enact role r; and i sending message No.9 to a specific interface infrastructure s count as i deacting role r. Examples 3-5 have shown how roles can be formalized in our framework thereby getting a formal semantics: roles are also sets of terminological axioms concerning state types of the sort rea(i, r).",
        "It is worth noticing that this modeling option is aligned with work on social theory addressing the concept of role such as [20]. 2.5 Tractable specifications of institutions In the previous sections we fully deployed the expressivity of the language introduced in Section 2.1 and used its semantics to provide a formal understanding of many essential aspects of institutions in terms of transition systems.",
        "This section spends a few words about the viability of performing automated reasoning in the logic presented.",
        "The satisfiability problem4 in logic ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is undecidable since transition type inclusion axioms correspond to a version of what in Description Logic are known as role-value maps and logics extending ALC with role-value maps are known to be undecidable ([3]).",

        "Specifically, institutive and terminative modules can be represented which contain transition types inclusion axioms.",
        "Restricted versions of status modules can also be represented enabling two essential deontic notions: it is possible (respectively, impossible) to reach a violation state by performing a transition of a certain type, and it is possible (respectively, impossible) to reach a legal state by performing a transition of a certain type.",
        "To this aim language Lins would need to be expanded with a set of state types {legal(i)}0≤i≤n whose intuitive meaning is to denote legal states as opposed to states of type viol(i).",

(a is executable exactly in γ states) and γ ≡ ∃¬a. (the negation of a is executable exactly in γ states).",
        "In other words, an infrastructure specification states all and only the conditions under which an atomic brute transition type and its negation are executable, which occur in the brute alphabet of the bridge axioms of Ins.",

        "EXAMPLE 6. (Infrastructure specification) Consider the institution specified in Example 1.",
        "A simple infrastructure Inf for that institution could contain for instance the following terminological axioms for any pair of different agents i, j and message type msg: ∃SEND(msg33, i, j). (20) The formula states that it is always in the possibilities of agent i to send message No. 33 to agent j.",

        "These interactions can be depicted as the links of a graph defined on the set of roles of the organization.",
        "Such links are then to be labeled on the basis of the type of interaction they stand for.",
        "First of all, it should be clear whether a link denotes that a certain interaction between two roles can, or ought to, or may etc. take place.",
        "Secondly, links should be labeled according to the transition type α they refer to and the conditions γ in which that transition can, ought to, may etc. take place.",
        "Links in a formal specification of an organizational structure stand therefore for statements of the kind: role r can (ought to, may) execute α w.r.t. role s if γ is the case.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, the following definition will consider only the can and ought-to interaction modalities.",
        "State and transition types in Lins ∪Lbrute will be used to label the links of the structure.",
        "Interaction modalities can therefore be of an institutional kind or of a brute kind.",
        "DEFINITION 6. (Organizational structure) An organizational structure is a multi-graph: OS = Roles, {Cp}p∈Mod, {Op}p∈Mod where: • Mod denotes a set of pairs p = γ : α, that is, a set of state type (condition) and transition type (action) pairs of Lins∪Lbrute with α being an atomic transition-type indexed with a pair (i, j) denoting placeholders for the actor and the recipient of the transition; • C (can) denotes links to be interpreted in terms of the executability of the related α in γ, whereas O (ought) denotes links to be interpreted in terms of the obligation to execute the related α in γ.",
        "By the expressions (r, s) ∈ Cγ:α and (r, s) ∈ Oγ:α we mean therefore: agents enacting role r can and, respectively, ought to interact with agents enacting role s by performing α in states of type γ.",
        "As shown in [11] such formal representations of organizational structures are of use for investigating the structural properties (robustness, flexibility, etc.) that a given organization exhibits.",

        "The next and final step of the work consists in providing a formal relation between the two frameworks.",
        "This formal relation will make explicit how institutions are related to organizational structures and vice versa.",
        "In particular, it will become clear how a normative conception of the notion of role relates to a structural one, that is, how the view of roles as a sets of norms (specifying how an agent can enact and deact the role, and what social status it obtains by doing that) relates to the view of roles as positions within social structures. 3.3 Relating institutions to organizations The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 633 To translate a given concrete institution into a corresponding organizational structure we need a function t assigning pairs of roles to axioms.",

        "That is to say, executability and obligation laws containing the enactment configuration rea(i, r) rea(j, s) as a premise and concerning transition of types α, with i actor and j recipient of the α transition, are translated into role pairs (r, s).",
        "DEFINITION 7. (Correspondence of specifications) A concrete institution CIns = Γ, A is said to correspond to an organizational structure OS (and vice versa) if, for every x ∈ Γ: • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. iff t(x) ∈ Cγ:α • x = rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) iff t(x) ∈ Oγ:α Intuitively, function t takes axioms from Γ (i.e., the set of state type terminological axioms of CIns) and yields pairs of roles.",

        "More concretely, axioms of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∃α. (executability laws) are translated into the pair (r, s) belonging to the executability dimension (i.e., C) of the organizational structure w.r.t. the execution of α under circumstances γ. Analogously, axioms of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (obligation laws) are translated into the pair (r, s) belonging to the obligation dimension (i.e., O) of the organizational structure w.r.t. the execution of α under circumstances γ.",
        "Leaving technicalities aside, function t distills thus the terminological and infrastructural constraints of CIns into structural ones.",
        "The institutive, terminative and status modules of roles are translated into definitions of positions within a OS.",
        "From a design perspective the interpretation of Definition 7 is twofold.",
        "On the one hand (from left to right), it can make explicit what the structural consequences are of a given institution supported by a given infrastructure.",
        "On the other hand (from right to left), it can make explicit what kind of institution is actually implemented by a given organizational structure.",
        "Let us see this in some more details.",
        "Given a concrete institution CIns, Definition 7 allows a designer to be aware of the impact that specific terminological choices (in particular, the choice of certain bridge axioms) and infrastructural ones have at a structural level.",
        "Notice that Definition 7 supports the inference of links in a structure.",
        "By checking whether a given inclusion statement of the relevant syntactic form follows from CIns (i.e., the so-called subsumption problem of DL) it is possible, via t, to add new links to the corresponding organizational structure.",
        "This can be recursively done by just adding any new inferred inclusion x to the previous set of axioms Γ, thus obtaining an updated institutional specification containing Γ ∪ {x}.",
        "This process can be thought of as the inference of structural links from institutional specifications.",
        "In other words, it is possible to use institution specifications as inference tools for structural specifications.",
        "For instance, the infrastructural choice formalized in Example 7 implies that for the pair of roles (buyer, seller), it is always the case that (buyer, seller) ∈ C :PAY(i,j,b).",
        "This link follows from links (buyer, seller) ∈ C :BNK(i,j,b) and (buyer, seller) ∈ C :CC(i,j,b) on the grounds of the bridge axioms of the institution (Formula 22).",
        "Suppose now a designer to be interested in a system which, besides implementing an institution, also incorporates an organizational structure enjoying desirable structural properties such as flexibility, or robustness6 .",
        "By relating structural links to state type inclusions it is therefore possible to check whether adding a link in OS results in a stronger institutional specification, that is, if the corresponding inclusion statement is not already implied by Ins.",
        "To draw a parallelism with what just said in the previous paragraph, this process can be thought of as the inference of norms and infrastructural constraints from the specification of organizational structures.",
        "To give a simple example consider again Example 6 but from a reversed perspective.",
        "Suppose a designer wants a fully connected graph in the dimension C :SEND(i,j) of the organizational structure.",
        "Exploiting Definition 7, we would obtain a number of executability laws in the fashion of Formula 20 for all roles in Roles (thus 2|Roles| axioms).",
        "Definition 7 establishes a correspondence between two essentially different perspectives on the design of open systems allowing for feedbacks between the two to be formally analyzed.",
        "One last observation is in order.",
        "While given a concrete institution an organizational structure can be in principle fully specified (by checking for all -finitely many- relevant inclusion statements whether they are implied or not by the institution), it is not possible to obtain a full terminological specification from an organizational structure.",
        "This lies on the fact that in Definition 6 the strictly terminological information contained in the specification of an institution (eminently, the set of transition type axioms A and therefore the bridge axioms) is lost while moving to a structural description.",
        "This shows, in turn, that the added value of the specification of institutions lies precisely in the terminological link they establish between institutional and brute, i.e., system level notions. 4.",
        "CONCLUSIONS The paper aimed at providing a comprehensive formal analysis of the institutional metaphor and its relation to the organizational one.",
        "The predominant formal tool has been description logic.",
        "TBoxes has been used to represent the specifications of institutions (Definition 3) and their infrastructures (Definition 6), providing therefore a transition system semantics for a number of institutional notions (Examples 1-7).",
        "Multi-graphs has then been used to represent the specification of organizational structures (Definition 6).",
        "The last result presented concerned the definition of a formal correspondence between institution and organization specifications (Definition 7), which provides a formal way for switching between the two paradigms.",
        "All in all, these results deliver a way for relating abstract system specifications (i.e., institutions as sets of norms) to specifications that are closer to an implemented system (i.e., organizational structures). 5.",

                "At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc.",

                "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",

                "By checking whether a given inclusion statement of the relevant syntactic form follows from CIns (i.e., the so-called subsumption problem of DL) it is possible, via t, to add new links to the corresponding organizational structure.",

                "The paper presents a formal semantics for the notion of institution and its components (abstract and concrete norms, empowerment of agents, roles) and defines a formal relation between institutions and organizational structures.",
                "As a result, it is shown how institutional norms can be refined to constructsorganizational structures-which are closer to an implemented system.",
                "It is also shown how such a refinement process can be fully formalized and it is therefore amenable to rigorous verification.",

                "INTRODUCTION The opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of organizational and social theory to distributed AI and multiagent systems (MASs) has long been advocated ([8]).",
                "In MASs the application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system design has proven to be useful for the development of methodologies and tools.",
                "In many cases, however, the application of these conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high level design of the systems.",
                "It is our thesis that the application of those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure, etc. obtain a formal semantics.",
                "This has been the case for agent programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.) have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]).",
                "As a matter of fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures and programming languages.",
                "What is lacking at the moment for the design and development of open MASs is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that BDI-like formalisms have played for the design and development of single-agent architectures.",
                "Aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one.",
                "The main result of the paper consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.",
                "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",
                "In Section 3 the framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution.",
                "The extended framework is then studied in relation to the formalism for representing organizational structures presented in [11].",
                "In Section 4 some conclusions follow. 2.",
                "INSTITUTIONS Social theory usually thinks of institutions as the rules of the game ([18, 23]).",
                "From an agent perspective institutions are, to paraphrase this quote, the rules of the various games agents can play in order to interact with one another.",
                "To assume an institutional perspective on MASs means therefore to think of MASs in normative terms: [. . . ] law, computer systems, and many other kinds of organizational structure may be viewed as instances of normative systems.",
                "We use the term to refer to any set of interacting agents whose behavior can usefully be regarded as governed by norms ([15], p.276).",
                "The normative system perspective on institutions is, as such, nothing original and it is already a quite acknowledged position within the community working on electronic institutions, or eInstitutions ([26]).",
                "What has not been sufficiently investigated and understood with formal methods is, in our view, the question: what does it 628 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS amount to, for a MAS, to be put under a set of norms?",
                "Or in other words: what does it mean for a designer of an eInstitution to state a set of norms?",
                "We advance a precise thesis on this issue, which is also inspired by work in social theory: Now, as the original manner of producing physical <br>entities</br> is creation, there is hardly a better way to describe the production of moral <br>entities</br> than by the word imposition [impositio].",
                "For moral <br>entities</br> do not arise from the intrinsic substantial principles of things but are superadded to things already existent and physically complete ([21], pp. 100-101).",
                "By ignoring for a second the philosophical jargon of the Seventeenth century we can easily extract an illuminating message from the excerpt: what institutions do is to impose properties on already existing <br>entities</br>.",
                "That is to say, institutions provide descriptions of <br>entities</br> by making use of conceptualizations that are not proper of the common descriptions of those <br>entities</br>.",
                "For example, that cars have wheels is a common factual property, whereas the fact that cars count as vehicles in some technical legal sense is a property that law imposes on the concept car.",
                "To say it with [25], the fact that cars have wheels is a brute fact, while the fact that cars are vehicles is an institutional fact.",
                "Institutions build structured descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a given domain.",
                "At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc.",
                "They do this via linking some institutional properties of the possible states and transitions of the system (e.g., agent i enacts role r) to some brute properties of those states and transitions (e.g., agent i performs protocol No.56).",
                "An institutional property is therefore a property of system states or system transitions (i.e., a state type or a transition type) that does not belong to a merely technical, or factual, description of the system.",
                "To sum up, institution are viewed as sets of norms (normative system perspective), and norms are thought of as the imposition of an institutional description of the system upon its description in terms of brute properties.",
                "In a nutshell, institutions are impositions of institutional terminologies upon brute ones.",
                "The following sections provide a formal analysis of this thesis and show its explanatory power in delivering a rigorous understanding of key features of institutions.",
                "Because of its suitability for representing complex domain descriptions, the formal framework we will make use of is the one of Description Logics (DL).",
                "The use of such formalism will also stress the idea of viewing institutions as the impositions of domain descriptions. 2.1 Preliminaries: a very expressive DL The description logic language enabling the necessary expressivity expands the standard description logic language ALC ([3]) with relational operators ( ,◦,¬,id) to express complex transition types, and relational hierarchies (H) to express inclusion between transition types.",

                "It is worth providing the intuitive reading of a couple of the operators and the constructs just introduced.",

                "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",

                "Terminological axioms in Γbridge and Abridge formalize in DL the Searlean notion of counts-as conditional ([25]), that is, rules stating what kind of meaning an institution gives to certain brute facts and transitions (e.g., checking box No.4 in form No.2 counts as accepting your personal data to be used for research purposes).",
                "A formal theory of counts-as statements has been thoroughly developed in a series of papers among which [10, 13].",
                "The technical content of the present paper heavily capitalizes on that work.",
                "Notice also that given the semantics presented in Definition 2, if institutions can be specified via TBoxes then the meaning of such specifications is a set of interpreted transition systems, i.e., the models of those TBoxes.",

                "Suppose now a system has to be built which complies with this norm.",
                "The first question is: what does it mean, in concrete, to discriminate on the basis of citizenship?",
                "The system designer should make some concrete choices for interpreting the norm and these choices should be kept track of in order to explicitly link the abstract norm to its concrete interpretation.",
                "The problem can be represented as follows.",
                "The abstract norm is formalized by Formula 1 by making use of a standard reduction technique of deontic notions (see [16]): the statement it is forbidden to discriminate on the basis of citizenship amounts to the statement after every execution of a transition of type DISCR(i, j) the system always ends up in a violation state.",
                "Together with the norm also some intuitive background knowledge about the discrimination action needs to be formalized.",
                "Here, as well as in the rest of the examples in the paper, we provide just that part of the formalization which is strictly functional to show how the formalism works in practice.",
                "Formulae 2 and 3 express two effect laws: if the requester j is Dutch then after all executions of transitions of type DISCR(i, j) j is accepted by i, whereas if it is not all the executions of the transitions of the same type have as an effect that it is not accepted.",
                "All formulae have to be read as schemata determining a finite number of subsumption expressions depending on the number of agents i, j considered. ∀DISCR(i, j).viol ≡ (1) dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).accepted(j) (2) ¬dutch(j) ∀DISCR(i, j).¬accepted(j) (3) The rest of the axioms concern the translation of the abstract type DISCR(i, j) to concrete transition types.",
                "Formula 4 refines it by making explicit that a precise if-then-else procedure counts as a discriminatory act of agent i. Formulae 5 and 6 specify which messages of i to j count as acceptance and rejection.",
                "If the designer uses transition types SEND(msg33, i, j) and SEND(msg38, i, j) for the concrete system specification, then Formulae 5 and 6 can be thought of as bridge axioms connecting notions belonging to the institutional alphabet (to accept, and to reject) to concrete ones (to send specific messages).",
                "Finally, Formulae 7 and 8 state two intuitive effect laws concerning the ACCEPT(i, j) and REJECT(i, j) types. if dutch(j)then ACCEPT(i, j) else REJECT(i, j) DISCR(i, j) (4) SEND(msg33, i, j) ACCEPT(i, j) (5) SEND(msg38, i, j) REJECT(i, j) (6) ∀ACCEPT(i, j).accepted(j) ≡ (7) ∀REJECT(i, j).¬accepted(j) ≡ (8) It is easy to see, on the grounds of the semantics exposed in Definition 2, that the following concrete inclusion statement holds w.r.t. 630 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Current formal approaches to institutions, such as ISLANDER [6], do not allow for the formal specification of explicit translations of abstract norms into concrete ones, and focus only on norms that can be specified at the concrete system specification level.",
                "What Example 1 shows is that the problem of the abstractness of norms in institutions can be formally addressed and can be given a precise formal semantics.",
                "The scenario suggests that, just by modifying an appropriate set of terminological axioms, it is possible for the designer to obtain a different institution by just modifying the sets of bridge axioms without touching the terminological axioms expressed only in the institutional language Lins.",
                "In fact, it is the case that a same set of abstract norms can be translated to different and even incompatible sets of concrete norms.",
                "This translation can nevertheless not be arbitrary ([1]).",
                "EXAMPLE 2. (Acceptable and unacceptable translations of abstract norms) Reconsider again the scenario sketched in Example 1.",
                "The transition type DISCR(i, j) has been translated to a complex procedure composed by concrete transition types.",
                "Would any translation do?",
                "Consider an alternative institution specification Ins containing Formulae 1-3 and the following translation rule: PAY(j, i, e10) DISCR(i, j) (10) Would this formula be an acceptable translation of the abstract norm expressed in Formula 1?",
                "The axiom states that transitions where i receives e10 from j count as transitions of type DISCR(i, j).",
                "Needless to say this is not intuitive, because the abstract transition type DISCR(i, j) obeys some intuitive conceptual constraints (Formulae 2 and 3) that all its translations should also obey.",
                "In fact, the following inclusions would then hold in Ins : dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).accepted(j) (11) ¬dutch(j) ∀PAY(j, i, e10).¬accepted(j) (12) In fact, there properties of the transition type PAY(j, i, e10) look at least awkward: if an agent is Dutch than by paying e10 it would be accepted, while if it was not Dutch the same action would make it not accepted.",
                "The problem is that the meaning of paying is not intuitively subsumed by the meaning of discriminating.",
                "In other words, a transition type PAY(j, i, e10) does not intuitively yield the effects that a sub-type of DISCR(i, j) yields.",
                "It is on the contrary perfectly intuitive that Formula 9 obeys the constraints in Formulae 2 and 3, which it does, as it can be easily checked on the grounds of the semantics.",
                "It is worth stressing that without providing a model-theoretic semantics for the translation rules linking the institutional notions to the brute ones, it would not be so straightforward to model the logical constraints to which the translations are subjected (Example 2).",
                "This is precisely the advantage of viewing translation rules as specific terminological axioms, i.e., Γbridge and Abridge, working as a bridge between two languages (Definition 3).",
                "In [12], we have thoroughly compared this approach with approaches such as [9] which conceive of translation rules as inference rules.",
                "The two examples have shown how our approach can account for some essential features of institutions.",
                "In the next section the same framework is applied to provide a formal analysis of the notion of role. 2.4 Institutional modules and roles Viewing institutions as the impositions of institutional descriptions on systems states and transitions allows for analyzing the normative system perspective itself (i.e., institutions are sets of norms) at a finer granularity.",
                "We have seen that the terminological axioms specifying an institution concern complex descriptions of new institutional notions.",
                "Some of the institutional state types occurring in the institution specification play a key role in structuring the specification of the institution itself.",
                "The paradigmatic example in this sense ([25]) are facts such as agent i enacts role r which will be denoted by state types rea(i, r).",
                "By stating how an agent can enact and deact a role r, and what normative consequences follow from the enactment of r, an institution describes expected forms of agents behavior while at the same time abstracting from the concrete agents taking part to the system.",
                "The sets of norms specifying an institution can be clustered on the grounds of the rea state types.",
                "For each relevant institutional state type (e.g., rea(i, r)), the terminological axioms which define an institution, i.e., its norms, can be clustered in (possibly overlapping) sets of three different types: the axioms specifying how states of that institutional type can be reached (e.g., how an agent i can enact the role r); how states of that type can be left (e.g., how an agent i can deact the a role r); and what kind of institutional consequences do those states bear (e.g., what rights and power does agent i acquire by enacting role r).",
                "Borrowing the terminology from work in legal and institutional theory ([23, 25]), these clusters of norms can be called, respectively, institutive, terminative and status modules.",
                "Status modules We call status modules those sets of terminological axioms which specify the institutional consequences of the occurrence of a given institutional state-of-affairs, for instance, the fact that agent i enacts role r. EXAMPLE 3. (A status module for roles) Enacting a role within an institution bears some institutional consequences that are grouped under the notion of status: by playing a role an agent acquires a specific status.",
                "Some of these consequences are deontic and concern the obligations, rights, permissions under which the agent puts itself once it enacts the role.",
                "An example which pertains to the normative description of the status of both a buyer and a seller roles is the following: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) win bid(i, j, b) ∀¬PAY(i, j, b).viol(i) (13) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role and i wins bid b then if i does not perform a transition of type PAY (i, j, b), i.e., does not pay to j the price corresponding to bid b, then the system ends up in a state that the institution classifies as a violation state with i being the violator.",
                "Notice that Formula 13 formalizes at the same time an obligation pertaining to the role buyer and a right pertaining to the role seller.",
                "Of particular interest are then those consequences that attribute powers to agents enacting specific roles: rea(i, buyer) rea(j, seller) ∀BID(i, j, b).bid(i, j, b) (14) SEND(i, j, msg49) BID(i, j, b) (15) If agent i enacts the buyer role and j the seller role, every time agent i bids b to j this action results in an institutional state testifying that the corresponding bid has been placed by i (Formula 14).",
                "Formula 15 states how the bidding action can be executed by sending a specific message to j (SEND(i, j, msg49)).",
                "Some observations are in order.",

                "More interesting is instead how the notion of institutional power is modeled.",
                "Essentially, the empowerment phenomenon is analyzed in term of two rules: one specifying the institutional effects of an institutional action (Formula 14), and one translating the institutional transition type in a brute one (Formula 15).",
                "Systems of rules of this type empower the agents enacting some relevant role by establishing a connection between the brute actions of the agents and some institutional effect.",
                "Whether the agents are actually able to execute the required brute actions is a different issue, since agent i can be in some states (or even all states) unable to effectuate a SEND(i, j, msg49) transition.",
                "This is the case also in human societies: priests are empowered to give rise to marriages but if a priest is not in state of performing the required speech acts he is actually unable to marry anybody.",
                "There is a difference between being entitled to make a bid and being in state of making a bid ([4]).",
                "In other words, Formulae 14 and 15 express only that agents playing the buyer role are entitled to make bids.",
                "The actual possibility of performing the required brute actions is not an institutional issue, but rather an issue concerning the implementation of an institution in a concrete system.",
                "We address this issue extensively in Section 33 .",
                "Institutive modules We call institutive modules those sets of terminological axioms of an institution specification describing how states with certain institutional properties can be reached, for instance, how an agent i can reach a state in which it enacts role r. They can be seen as procedures that the institution define in order for the agents to bring institutional states of affairs about.",
                "EXAMPLE 4. (An institutive module for roles) The fact that an agent i enacts a role r (rea(i, r)) is the effect of a corresponding enactment action ENACT(i, r) performed under certain circumstances (Formula 16), namely that the agent does not already enact the role, and that the agent satisfies given conditions (cond(i, r)), which might for instance pertain the computational capabilities required for an agent to play the chosen role, or its capability to interact with some specific systems infrastructures.",
                "Formula 17 specifies instead the procedure counting as an action of type ENACT(i, r).",
                "Such a procedure is performed through a system infrastructure s, which notifies to i that it has been registered as enacting role r after sending the necessary piece of data d (SEND(i, s, d)), e.g., a valid credit card number. ¬rea(i, r) cond(i, r) ENACT(i, r).rea(i, r) (16) SEND(i, s, d) ◦ NOTIFY(s, i) ENACT(i, r) (17) Terminative modules Analogously, we call terminative modules those sets of terminological axioms stating how a state with certain institutional properties can be left.",
                "Rules of this kind state for instance how an agent can stop enacting a certain role.",
                "They can be thus thought of as procedures that the institution defines in order for the agent to see to it that certain institutional states stop holding.",
                "EXAMPLE 5. (A terminative module for roles) Terminative modules for roles specify, for instance, how a transition type DEACT(i, r) can be executed which has as consequence the reaching of a state of type ¬rea(i, r): rea(i, r) DEACT(i, r).¬rea(i, r) (18) SEND(i, s, msg9) DEACT(i, r) (19) That is to say, i deacting a role r always leads to a state where 3 See in particular Example 6 and Definition 5 i does not enact role r; and i sending message No.9 to a specific interface infrastructure s count as i deacting role r. Examples 3-5 have shown how roles can be formalized in our framework thereby getting a formal semantics: roles are also sets of terminological axioms concerning state types of the sort rea(i, r).",
                "It is worth noticing that this modeling option is aligned with work on social theory addressing the concept of role such as [20]. 2.5 Tractable specifications of institutions In the previous sections we fully deployed the expressivity of the language introduced in Section 2.1 and used its semantics to provide a formal understanding of many essential aspects of institutions in terms of transition systems.",

                "The satisfiability problem4 in logic ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) is undecidable since transition type inclusion axioms correspond to a version of what in <br>description logic</br> are known as role-value maps and logics extending ALC with role-value maps are known to be undecidable ([3]).",

                "The main result of the paper consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.",
                "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, <br>role</br>, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",
                "In Section 3 the framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution.",

                "Institutions build structured descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a given domain.",
                "At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a <br>role</br> r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc.",
                "They do this via linking some institutional properties of the possible states and transitions of the system (e.g., agent i enacts <br>role</br> r) to some brute properties of those states and transitions (e.g., agent i performs protocol No.56).",

Analogously, axioms of the form rea(i, r) rea(j, s) γ ∀¬α.viol(i) (obligation laws) are translated into the pair (r, s) belonging to the obligation dimension (i.e., O) of the organizational structure w.r.t. the execution of α under circumstances γ.",

                "By checking whether a given inclusion statement of the relevant syntactic form follows from CIns (i.e., the so-called subsumption problem of DL) it is possible, via t, to add new links to the corresponding organizational structure.",

                "While given a concrete institution an organizational structure can be in principle fully specified (by checking for all -finitely many- relevant inclusion statements whether they are implied or not by the institution), it is not possible to obtain a full terminological specification from an organizational structure.",
                "This lies on the fact that in Definition 6 the strictly terminological information contained in the specification of an institution (eminently, the set of transition type axioms A and therefore the bridge axioms) is lost while moving to a structural description.",
                "This shows, in turn, that the added value of the specification of institutions lies precisely in the terminological link they establish between institutional and brute, i.e., system level notions. 4.",

                "INTRODUCTION The opportunity of a technology transfer from the field of organizational and social theory to distributed AI and multiagent systems (MASs) has long been advocated ([8]).",
                "In MASs the application of the organizational and institutional metaphors to system design has proven to be useful for the development of methodologies and tools.",
                "In many cases, however, the application of these conceptual apparatuses amounts to mere heuristics guiding the high level design of the systems.",
                "It is our thesis that the application of those apparatuses can be pushed further once their key concepts are treated formally, that is, once notions such as norm, role, structure, etc. obtain a formal semantics.",
                "This has been the case for agent programming languages after the relevant concepts borrowed from folk psychology (belief, intention, desire, knowledge, etc.) have been addressed in comprehensive formal logical theories such as, for instance, BDICTL ([22]) and KARO ([17]).",
                "As a matter of fact, those theories have fostered the production of architectures and programming languages.",
                "What is lacking at the moment for the design and development of open MASs is, in our opinion, something that can play the role that BDI-like formalisms have played for the design and development of single-agent architectures.",
                "Aim of the present paper is to fill this gap with respect to the notion of institution providing formal foundations for the application of the institutional metaphor and for its relation to the organizational one.",
                "The main result of the paper consists in showing how abstract constraints (institutions) can be step by step refined to concrete structural descriptions (organizational structures) of the to-be-implemented system, bridging thus the gap between abstract norms and concrete system specifications.",
                "Concretely, in Section 2, a logical framework is presented which provides a formal semantics for the notions of institution, norm, role, and which supports the account of key features of institutions such as the translation of abstract norms into concrete and implementable ones, the institutional empowerment of agents, and some aspects of the design of norm enforcement.",
                "In Section 3 the framework is extended to deal with the notion of the infrastructure of an institution.",
                "The extended framework is then studied in relation to the formalism for representing organizational structures presented in [11].",
                "In Section 4 some conclusions follow. 2.",
                "INSTITUTIONS Social theory usually thinks of institutions as the rules of the game ([18, 23]).",
                "From an agent perspective institutions are, to paraphrase this quote, the rules of the various games agents can play in order to interact with one another.",
                "To assume an institutional perspective on MASs means therefore to think of MASs in normative terms: [. . . ] law, computer systems, and many other kinds of <br>organizational structure</br> may be viewed as instances of normative systems.",
                "We use the term to refer to any set of interacting agents whose behavior can usefully be regarded as governed by norms ([15], p.276).",
                "The normative system perspective on institutions is, as such, nothing original and it is already a quite acknowledged position within the community working on electronic institutions, or eInstitutions ([26]).",
                "What has not been sufficiently investigated and understood with formal methods is, in our view, the question: what does it 628 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS amount to, for a MAS, to be put under a set of norms?",
                "Or in other words: what does it mean for a designer of an eInstitution to state a set of norms?",
                "We advance a precise thesis on this issue, which is also inspired by work in social theory: Now, as the original manner of producing physical entities is creation, there is hardly a better way to describe the production of moral entities than by the word imposition [impositio].",
                "For moral entities do not arise from the intrinsic substantial principles of things but are superadded to things already existent and physically complete ([21], pp. 100-101).",
                "By ignoring for a second the philosophical jargon of the Seventeenth century we can easily extract an illuminating message from the excerpt: what institutions do is to impose properties on already existing entities.",
                "That is to say, institutions provide descriptions of entities by making use of conceptualizations that are not proper of the common descriptions of those entities.",
                "For example, that cars have wheels is a common factual property, whereas the fact that cars count as vehicles in some technical legal sense is a property that law imposes on the concept car.",
                "To say it with [25], the fact that cars have wheels is a brute fact, while the fact that cars are vehicles is an institutional fact.",
                "Institutions build structured descriptions of institutional properties upon brute descriptions of a given domain.",
                "At this point, the step toward eInstitutions is natural. eInstitutions impose properties on the possible states of a MAS: they specify what are the states in which an agent i enacts a role r; what are the states in which a certain agent is violating the norms of the institution, etc.",
                "They do this via linking some institutional properties of the possible states and transitions of the system (e.g., agent i enacts role r) to some brute properties of those states and transitions (e.g., agent i performs protocol No.56).",
                "An institutional property is therefore a property of system states or system transitions (i.e., a state type or a transition type) that does not belong to a merely technical, or factual, description of the system.",
                "To sum up, institution are viewed as sets of norms (normative system perspective), and norms are thought of as the imposition of an institutional description of the system upon its description in terms of brute properties.",
                "In a nutshell, institutions are impositions of institutional terminologies upon brute ones.",
                "The following sections provide a formal analysis of this thesis and show its explanatory power in delivering a rigorous understanding of key features of institutions.",
                "Because of its suitability for representing complex domain descriptions, the formal framework we will make use of is the one of Description Logics (DL).",
                "The use of such formalism will also stress the idea of viewing institutions as the impositions of domain descriptions. 2.1 Preliminaries: a very expressive DL The description logic language enabling the necessary expressivity expands the standard description logic language ALC ([3]) with relational operators ( ,◦,¬,id) to express complex transition types, and relational hierarchies (H) to express inclusion between transition types.",
                "Following a notational convention common within DL we denote this language with ALCH( ,◦,¬,id) .",
