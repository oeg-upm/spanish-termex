First, an introduction to context computing and a motivation for using contextual information to facilitate group interaction is given. We then present the architecture of our system, which consists of two parts: a subsystem for location sensing that acquires information about the location of users as well as spatial proximities between them, and one for the actual context-aware application, which provides services for group interaction.

General Terms Design, Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION Todays computing environments are characterized by an increasing number of powerful, wirelessly connected mobile devices. Users can move throughout an environment while carrying their computers with them and having remote access to information and services, anytime and anywhere. New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations. This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together. Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS). It supports group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments in a way that group members need not to at the same place any longer in order to interact with each other or just to be aware of the others situation. In the following subchapters, we will give a short overview on context aware computing and motivate its benefits for supporting group interaction. A software framework for developing contextsensitive applications is presented, which serves as middleware for GISS. Chapter 2 presents the architecture of GISS, and chapter 3 and 4 discuss the location sensing and group interaction concepts of GISS in more detail. Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing? According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs. Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments. Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context. The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects. In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time. Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others. These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types). For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address). According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval. Figure 1. Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging). In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1). First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized. Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information. In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2). First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs. The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity. It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users. The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents. Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places. Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities. With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support. Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members. At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up. We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems. Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around. Figure 2. Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3]. We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity. Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity. This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4. When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself. We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account. Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts. Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications. This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer. This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario. Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity. These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes. Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users. Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute. The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network. In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport. XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own. The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events. Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running. Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself. Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system. Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions. These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration. A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically. To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer. Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf. Figure 1). A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level. We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them. Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum. Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation). These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server. We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand. All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction). This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored. The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities. Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3. Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application. Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core. Figure 3. Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user. It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups. Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services. The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible. Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture. Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute. The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes. The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on. As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 . We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use. As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger. For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later. The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication. Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status. The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer. The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example. Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication. Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them. In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3. LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail. Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location. In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates. We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data. Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level. Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms. We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room). We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic. These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation. Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms. Figure 4. Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users. As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too. While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor. Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information. Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g. RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server. The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location. This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations. One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms. If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined. We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1). The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader. As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations. We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest. Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms. The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location. A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive. The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor. Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure. The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms. A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each. Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor. Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e. Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations. Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers. This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range. Table 1. Comparison of implemented sensors Sensor Accuracy Coverage Administration RFID < 10 cm poor easy WLAN 1-4 m very well very timeconsuming Bluetooth ~ 10 m well time-consuming 3.2.2 Proximity Sensors Any sensor that is able to detect whether two users are in spatial proximity is referred to as proximity sensor. Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs. We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand. The Bluetooth-implementation goes along with the implementation of the Bluetooth-based location sensor. The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this. The second sensor is based on symbolic locations processed by Location Sensor Fusion, wherefore it does not need a client-side implementation. Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users. The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity. A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors. For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion. It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate. According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand. The fusion of symbolic locations as well as the fusion of spatial proximities operates on standardized information (cf. Figure 3). This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user). The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed. An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval. This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user. This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well. The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes. These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined. If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event). If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with. However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations. As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations. Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy). To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location). In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences. A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations. Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy. For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3. In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences. A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences. If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located. Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location. If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations. The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes. These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected. If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event). If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp. Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not. Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4. CONTEXTSENSITIVE INTERACTION 4.1 Overview In most of todays systems supporting interaction in groups, the provided means lack any awareness of the users current context, thus being unable to adapt to his needs. In our approach, we use context information to enhance interaction and provide further services, which offer new possibilities to the user. Furthermore, we believe that interaction in groups also has to take into account the current context of the group itself and not only the context of individual group members. For this reason, we also retrieve information about the groups current context, derived from the contexts of the group members together with some sort of meta-information (see chapter 4.3). The sources of context used for our application correspond with the four primary context types given in chapter 1.1 - identity (I), location (L), time (T) and activity (A). As stated before, we also take into account the context of the group the user is interaction with, so that we could add a fifth type of context informationgroup awareness (G) - to the classification. Using this context information, we can trigger context-aware activities in all of the three categories described in chapter 1.1 - presentation of information (P), automatic execution of services (A) and tagging of context to information for later retrieval (T). Table 2 gives an overview of activities we have already implemented; they are described comprehensively in chapter 4.4. The table also shows which types of context information are used for each activity and the category the activity could be classified in. 93 Table 2. Classification of implemented context-aware activities Service L T I A G P A T Location Visualisation X X X Group Building Support X X X X Support for Synchronous Communication X X X X Support for Asynchronous Communication X X X X X X X Availability Management X X X Task Management Support X X X X Meeting Support X X X X X X Reasons for implementing these very features are to take advantage of all four types of context information in order to support group interaction by utilizing a comprehensive knowledge about the situation a single user or a whole group is in. A critical issue for the user acceptance of such a system is the usability of its interface. We have evaluated several ways of presenting context-aware means of interaction to the user, until we came to the solution we use right now. Although we think that the user interface that has been implemented now offers the best trade-off between seamless integration of features and ease of use, it would be no problem to extend the architecture with other user interfaces, even on different platforms. The chosen solution is based on an existing instant messenger, which offers several possibilities to integrate our system (see chapter 4.2). The biggest advantage of this approach is that the user is confronted with a graphical user interface he is already used to in most cases. Furthermore, our system uses an instant messenger account as an identifier, so that the user does not have to register a further account anywhere else (for example, the user can use his already existing ICQ2 -account). 4.2 Instant Messenger Integration Our system is based upon an existing instant messenger, the socalled Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 . The implementation of this messenger is carried out as a project at Sourceforge4 . SIM supports multiple messenger protocols such as AIM5 , ICQ2 and MSN6 . It also supports connections to multiple accounts at the same time. Furthermore, full support for SMS-notification (where provided from the used protocol) is given. SIM is based on a plug-in concept. All protocols as well as parts of the user-interface are implemented as plug-ins. Its architecture is also used to extend the applications abilities to communicate with external applications. For this purpose, a remote control plug-in is provided, by which SIM can be controlled from external applications via socket connection. This remote control interface is extensively used by GISS for retrieving the contact list, setting the users availability-state or sending messages. The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network). The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to. This provides location awareness without taking too much space or requesting the users full attention. A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too. Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system. Besides location and time, we also use context information of users activity and identity, where we exploit the functionality provided by the underlying instant messenger system. Identity (or more exactly, the mapping of IDs to names as well as additional information from the users profile) can be distilled out of the contents of the users contact list. Information about the activity or a certain user is only available in a very restricted area, namely the activity at the computer itself. Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor. The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.). Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services. Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group. Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on. Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed. These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically. The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members. Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated. With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities. A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively. As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation. The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment). Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept. As we use a hierarchical location model, we are able to determine the most accurate common location of two users. In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed. If, for example, user A currently resides in room P121 at the first floor of a building and user B, which has to be displayed in the contact list of user A, is in room P304 at the third floor, the most accurate common location of these two users is the building they are in. For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A. If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken. Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name. On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS. Figure 5. GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus). The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one. We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf. Figure 6). Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf. Figure 4). Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided. In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person. The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name. Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4). Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside). The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle. Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen. Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users. As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time. When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups. As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups. So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them. Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes. In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group. Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time. Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily. In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups. They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time. The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor. It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered. For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not. Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department. As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet. This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system. In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported. However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time. Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients. Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group). Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions. We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group. Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user. These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time. Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea. The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized. In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness. For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations. These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only. Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore. Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread. Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time. Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown. All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user. Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system. To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context. These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3. The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes). The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule. As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled. Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases. Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups. These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs. A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion. On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group. The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work. In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting. Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place. During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants. When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments. Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work. If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5. CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information. First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction. An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments. It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation. We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself. Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation. To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms. A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6. REFERENCES [1] Beer, W., Christian, V., Ferscha, A., Mehrmann, L.

Introducción Los entornos informáticos de hoy se caracterizan por un número creciente de poderosos dispositivos móviles conectados de forma inalámbrica. Los usuarios pueden moverse a través de un entorno mientras llevan sus computadoras con ellos y tienen acceso remoto a la información y los servicios, en cualquier momento y en cualquier lugar. Aparecen nuevas situaciones, donde el contexto de los usuarios, por ejemplo, su ubicación actual o personas cercanas, es más dinámica;El cálculo no ocurre en una sola ubicación y en un solo contexto ya, sino que comprende una multitud de situaciones y ubicaciones. Este desarrollo lleva a una nueva clase de aplicaciones, que son conscientes del contexto en el que se ejecutan y que unen mundos virtuales y reales. Motivado por esto y el hecho de que solo se han realizado solo unos pocos estudios para apoyar la comunicación grupal en tales entornos informáticos [12], hemos desarrollado un sistema, al que referimos como Sistema de soporte de interacción grupal (GISS). Admite la interacción grupal en entornos informáticos distribuidos móviles de una manera que los miembros del grupo no necesitan en el mismo lugar más tiempo para interactuar entre sí o simplemente para ser conscientes de la situación de los demás. En los siguientes subcapteres, daremos una breve descripción general sobre la computación consciente del contexto y motivaremos sus beneficios para respaldar la interacción grupal. Se presenta un marco de software para desarrollar aplicaciones sensibles a los contextos, que sirve como middleware para GISS. El Capítulo 2 presenta la arquitectura de GISS, y el Capítulo 3 y 4 discuten los conceptos de detección y interacción grupal de GISS con más detalle. El Capítulo 5 ofrece un resumen final de nuestro trabajo.1.1 ¿Qué es la computación de contexto? Según el diccionario en línea de Merriam-Websters, el contexto se define como las condiciones interrelacionadas en las que existe algo o ocurre. Debido a que esta definición es muy general, se han hecho muchos enfoques para definir la noción de contexto con respecto a los entornos informáticos. La mayoría de las definiciones de contexto se hacen enumerando ejemplos o eligiendo sinónimos para el contexto. El término contexto se ha introducido primero en [10] donde el contexto se conoce como ubicación, identidades de personas y objetos cercanos, y cambios a esos objetos. En [2], el contexto también se define mediante una enumeración de ejemplos, a saber, la ubicación, las identidades de las personas alrededor del usuario, la hora del día, la temporada, la temperatura, etc. [9] define el contexto como la ubicación de los usuarios, el entorno, la identidady tiempo. Aquí nos ajustamos a una definición ampliamente aceptada y más formal, que define el contexto como cualquier información de la que puede usarse para caracterizar la situación de una entidad. Una entidad es una persona, lugar u objeto que se considera relevante para la interacción entre un usuario y una aplicación, incluidos el usuario y las aplicaciones.[4] [4] identifica cuatro tipos principales de información de contexto (a veces denominado dimensiones de contexto), que son, con respecto a la caracterización de la situación de una entidad, más importante que otras. Estos son ubicación, identidad, tiempo y actividad, que también se pueden utilizar para derivar otras fuentes de información contextual (tipos de contexto secundario). Por ejemplo, si conocemos la identidad de una persona, podemos obtener fácilmente información relacionada sobre esta persona de varias fuentes de datos (por ejemplo, día de nacimiento o dirección de correo electrónico). De acuerdo con esta definición, [4] define que un sistema es contextable si utiliza contexto para proporcionar información y/o servicios relevantes al usuario, donde la relevancia depende de la tarea de los usuarios.[4] también ofrece una clasificación de las características para aplicaciones conscientes de contexto, que comprende la presentación de información y servicios a un usuario, ejecución automática de un servicio y etiquetado de contexto a información para una recuperación posterior. Figura 1. Las capas de una computación de contexto de sistema consciente de contexto se basan en dos problemas principales, a saber, identificar el contexto relevante (identidad, ubicación, tiempo, actividad) y usar el contexto obtenido (ejecución automática, presentación, etiquetado). Para hacer esto, hay algunas capas entre (ver Figura 1). Primero, la información de contexto de bajo nivel obtenida debe transformarse, agregarse e interpretarse (transformación del contexto) y representada en un modelo mundial de contexto abstracto (representación del contexto), ya sea centralizada o descentralizada. Finalmente, la información de contexto almacenado se utiliza para desencadenar ciertos eventos de contexto (activación de contexto).[7] 1.2 Interacción grupal en contexto después de estas definiciones abstractas y formales sobre qué es el contexto y la informática del contexto, ahora nos centraremos en el objetivo principal de este trabajo, a saber, cómo se puede apoyar la interacción de los miembros del grupo móvil utilizando información de contexto. En [6] hemos identificado que los sistemas organizacionales son cruciales para apoyar a los grupos móviles (ver Figura 2). Primero, debe haber un sistema de gestión de información y conocimiento, que es capaz de apoyar a un equipo con sus necesidades de recopilación de procesos y conocimientos de procesamiento de información. La siguiente parte es el sistema de concientización, que se dedica a la perceptualización de los efectos de la actividad del equipo. Lo hace comunicando el contexto laboral, la agenda y la información del espacio de trabajo a los usuarios. Los sistemas de interacción brindan soporte para la comunicación entre los miembros del equipo, ya sea sincrónicos o asíncronos, y para el acceso compartido a artefactos, como documentos. Los sistemas de movilidad implementan mecanismos para permitir el acceso en cualquier lugar a la memoria del equipo, así como a la captura y entrega de información de conciencia de y en cualquier lugar. Finalmente, pero es importante, el sistema de innovación organizacional integra aspectos del equipo en sí, como roles, liderazgo e instalaciones compartidas. Con respecto a estos cinco aspectos del soporte del equipo, nos centramos en la interacción y cubrimos en parte la movilidad y el apoyo a la conciencia. La interacción grupal incluye todos los medios que permiten a los miembros del grupo comunicarse libremente con todos los demás miembros. En este punto, surge la pregunta de cómo se puede utilizar la información de contexto para admitir la interacción grupal. Creemos que la información sobre la situación actual de una persona proporciona un valor excedente a los sistemas de interacción grupal existentes. La información de contexto facilita la interacción grupal al permitir que cada miembro tenga en cuenta el estado de disponibilidad o la ubicación actual de otro miembro del grupo, lo que hace posible formar grupos dinámicamente, colocar post-its virtuales en el mundo real o determinar cuálLa gente está cerca. Figura 2. Soporte para grupos móviles [6] La mayoría de las aplicaciones de contexto de hoy en día usan solo ubicación y tiempo, y la ubicación se conoce como un tipo crucial de información de contexto [3]. También vemos la importancia de la información de ubicación en entornos móviles y ubicuos, por lo que un enfoque principal de nuestro trabajo está en la utilización de la información de ubicación e información sobre los usuarios en proximidad espacial. Sin embargo, creemos que la ubicación, como el único tipo de información de contexto utilizado, no es suficiente para apoyar la interacción grupal, por lo que también aprovechamos los otros tres tipos principales, a saber, la identidad, el tiempo y la actividad. Esto proporciona una descripción completa de la situación actual de los usuarios y, por lo tanto, permite numerosos medios para apoyar la interacción grupal, que se describen en detalle en el Capítulo 4.4. Cuando observamos los tipos de información de contexto establecida anteriormente, podemos ver que todos están centrados en el usuario, teniendo en cuenta solo el contexto del propio usuario. Creemos que para el apoyo de la interacción grupal, el estado del grupo en sí también se ha tenido en cuenta. Por lo tanto, hemos agregado un quinto contexto del grupo contextidimensional, que comprende más que la suma de los contextos de miembros individuales. El contexto grupal incluye cualquier información sobre la situación de un grupo completo, por ejemplo, cuántos miembros tiene actualmente un grupo o si un determinado grupo se reúne en este momento.1.3 Middleware de contexto El Sistema de soporte de interacción de grupo (GISS) utiliza el softwareFramework introducido en [1], que sirve como un middleware para desarrollar aplicaciones sensibles al contexto. Este llamado marco de contexto se basa en una arquitectura de comunicación distribuida y admite diferentes tipos de protocolos de transporte y mecanismos de codificación de mensajes.89 Una característica principal del marco es la abstracción de la recuperación de la información de contexto a través de varios sensores y su entrega a un nivel en el que no aparece ninguna diferencia, para el diseñador de aplicaciones, entre estos diferentes tipos de mecanismos de recuperación de contexto;La recuperación de información está oculta al desarrollador de aplicaciones. Esto se logra por las llamadas entidades, que describen Objectse.g.Un usuario humano, que es importante para un determinado escenario de contexto. Las entidades expresan su funcionalidad mediante el uso de los llamados atributos, que se pueden cargar en la entidad. Estos atributos son piezas complejas de software, que se implementan como clases de Java. Los atributos típicos son encapsulaciones de sensores, pero también se pueden utilizar para implementar servicios de contexto, por ejemplo, para notificar a otras entidades sobre los cambios de ubicación de los usuarios. Cada entidad puede contener una colección de tales atributos, donde una entidad en sí es un atributo. El conjunto inicial de atributos que contiene una entidad puede cambiar dinámicamente en tiempo de ejecución, si una entidad carga o descarga atributos del almacenamiento local o a través de la red. Para cargar e implementar nuevos atributos, una entidad tiene que hacer referencia a un cargador de clase y una capa de transporte y búsqueda, que administra el mecanismo de búsqueda para descubrir otras entidades y el transporte. Los archivos de configuración XML especifican qué conjunto inicial de entidades debe cargarse y qué atribuye estas entidades poseen. La comunicación entre entidades y atributos se basa en eventos de contexto. Cada atributo puede activar eventos, que se dirigen a otros atributos y entidades respectivamente, independientemente de qué computadora física está ejecutando. Entre otras cosas, y el evento contiene el nombre del evento y una lista de parámetros que entregan información sobre el evento en sí. Relacionado con esta arquitectura basada en eventos está el uso de reglas ECA (eventos-condición-acción) para definir el comportamiento del sistema de contexto. Por lo tanto, cada entidad tiene un interprendedor de reglas, que atrapa eventos activados, verifica las condiciones asociadas con ellos y causa ciertas acciones. Estas reglas son referenciadas por la configuración de XML Entitys. Una regla en sí incluso puede desencadenar la inserción de nuevas reglas o la descarga de las reglas existentes en tiempo de ejecución para cambiar dinámicamente el comportamiento del sistema de contexto. En resumen, el marco de contexto proporciona una arquitectura flexible y distribuida para ocultar datos de sensores de bajo nivel de aplicaciones de alto nivel y oculta los detalles de comunicación externa del desarrollador de aplicaciones. Además, puede adaptar su comportamiento dinámicamente cargando atributos, entidades o ecarules en tiempo de ejecución.2. Descripción general de la arquitectura Como GISS utiliza el marco de contexto descrito en el Capítulo 1.3 Como middleware, cada usuario está representado por una entidad, así como el servidor central, que es responsable de la transformación del contexto, la representación del contexto y la activación de contexto (cf. Figura 1). Una parte principal de nuestro trabajo es sobre la adquisición automatizada de la información de posición y su provisión independiente del sensor a nivel de aplicación. No solo sentimos la ubicación actual de los usuarios, sino que también determinamos las proximidades espaciales entre ellos. Al desarrollar la arquitectura, nos centramos en mantener al cliente lo más simple posible y reducir la comunicación entre el cliente y el servidor al mínimo. Cada cliente puede tener varios sensores de ubicación y/o proximidad conectados, que están encapsulados por los respectivos atributos del marco de contexto (encapsulación del sensor). Estos atributos son responsables de integrar implementaciones de sensores nativos en el marco de contexto y enviar información de posición dependiente del sensor al servidor. Consideramos que es muy importante apoyar diferentes tipos de sensores incluso al mismo tiempo, para mejorar la precisión de la ubicación, por un lado, al tiempo que proporciona un entorno generalizado de detección de ubicación con una transición perfecta entre diferentes técnicas de detección de ubicación, por otro lado. Todos los sensores de ubicación y proximidad admitidos están representados por atributos de contexto del lado del servidor, que corresponden a los atributos de encapsulación del sensor del lado del cliente y abstractan la información de posición dependiente del sensor recibida de todos los usuarios a través de la red inalámbrica (abstracción del sensor). Esto requiere un repositorio de contexto, donde se almacena el mapeo de diversas posiciones físicas en ubicaciones estandarizadas. La información estandarizada y la información de proximidad de cada usuario se pasa a los llamados atributos de fusión del sensor, uno para ubicaciones simbólicas y una segunda para proximidades espaciales. Su trabajo es fusionar la ubicación y la información proximidad de los clientes, respectivamente, que se describe en detalle en el Capítulo 3.3. Cada vez que cambia la ubicación simbólica de un usuario o la proximidad espacial entre dos usuarios, los atributos de fusión del sensor notifican el atributo de núcleo GISS, que controla la aplicación. Debido a la abstracción de la información de posición dependiente del sensor, el sistema puede extenderse fácilmente por sensores adicionales, solo implementando los (típicamente dos) atributos para los sensores de encapsulación (algunos sensores pueden no necesitar una parte del lado del cliente), abstraer posiciones físicas yobservando la interfaz a Giss Core. Figura 3. Arquitectura del Sistema de soporte de interacción de grupo (GISS) El Attribido Core-Attribute de GISS es el coordinador central de la aplicación como lo muestra al usuario. No solo sirve como una interfaz para el subsistema de detección de ubicación, sino que también recopila información de contexto adicional en otras dimensiones (tiempo, identidad o actividad).90 Cada vez que se detecta un cambio en el contexto de uno o más usuarios, Giss Core evalúa el efecto de estos cambios en el usuario, en los grupos a los que pertenece y sobre los otros miembros de estos grupos. Siempre que sea necesario, se lanzan eventos a los clientes afectados para activar actividades con el contexto, como cambiar la presentación de la información de concientización o la ejecución de los servicios. La parte del lado del cliente de la aplicación se mantiene lo más simple posible. Además, el diseño modular no fue solo un problema en el lado del sensor, sino también al diseñar la arquitectura de la interfaz de usuario. Por lo tanto, la interfaz de usuario completa se puede intercambiar fácilmente si todos los eventos definidos se tienen en cuenta y se entienden por la nueva interfaz-atributo. La interfaz de usuario implementada actualmente se divide en dos partes, que también están representadas por dos atributos. El atributo central en el lado del cliente es la llamada encapsulación de mensajeros instantáneos, que, por un lado, interactúa con el servidor a través de eventos y, por otro lado, sirve como un proxy para la aplicación externa en la que se basa la interfaz de usuario. Como aplicación externa, utilizamos un mensajero instantáneo de código abierto existente: el Messenger instantáneo simple (SIM) de ICQ2 -Comppliant 3. Hemos elegido e instantáneo Messenger como front-end porque proporciona una interfaz bien conocida para la mayoría de los usuarios y facilita una integración perfecta del soporte de interacción grupal, lo que aumenta la aceptación y la facilidad de uso. Como la funcionalidad básica del mensajero instantáneo, para servir como cliente en una red de mensajería instantánea, sigue siendo completamente funcional, nuestra aplicación puede usar las características ya proporcionadas por el mensajero. Por ejemplo, la actividad y la identidad de los contextos se derivan de la red de mensajeros como se describe más adelante. La encapsulación de mensajeros instantáneos también es responsable de apoyar la comunicación grupal. A través de la interfaz del Messenger, proporciona medios de comunicación sincrónica y asincrónica, así como un sistema de recordatorio y herramientas con contexto para administrar grupos y el estado de disponibilidad propio. La segunda parte de la interfaz de usuario es una visualización de las ubicaciones de los usuarios, que se implementa en el visor de atributos. La implementación actual proporciona un mapa bidimensional del campus, pero puede reemplazarse fácilmente por otras visualizaciones, por ejemplo, un modelo VRML tridimensional. Además, esta visualización se utiliza para mostrar los artefactos para la comunicación asincrónica. Basado en una visión del plano de piso del área geográfica que el usuario reside actualmente, ofrece una visión general rápida de la cual las personas están cerca, su estado y proporciona medios para interactuar con ellas. En los siguientes capítulos 3 y 4, describimos el respaldo de detección de ubicación y el front-end de la aplicación para admitir la interacción grupal con más detalle.3. Sensación de ubicación En el siguiente capítulo, presentaremos un modelo de ubicación, que se utiliza para representar ubicaciones;Posteriormente, describiremos la integración de los sensores de ubicación y proximidad en 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net Más detalles. Finalmente, tendremos un aspecto más cercano sobre la fusión de la información de ubicación y proximidad, adquirida por varios sensores.3.1 Modelo de ubicación Un modelo de ubicación (es decir, se necesita una representación de contexto para la ubicación de información contextual) para representar las ubicaciones de los usuarios, para poder facilitar consultas relacionadas con la ubicación como dada una ubicación, devolver una lista de todos los objetos allí oDado un objeto, devuelva su ubicación actual. En general, hay dos enfoques [3,5]: modelos simbólicos, que representan la ubicación como símbolos abstractos, y un modelo geométrico, que representan la ubicación como coordenadas. Hemos elegido un modelo de ubicación simbólica, que se refiere a ubicaciones como símbolos abstractos como la habitación P111 o el edificio de física, porque no requerimos datos de ubicación geométrica. En cambio, los símbolos abstractos son más convenientes para la interacción humana a nivel de aplicación. Además, utilizamos una jerarquía de contención de ubicación simbólica similar a la introducida en [11], que consiste en regiones de nivel superior, que contienen edificios, que contienen pisos, y los pisos nuevamente contienen habitaciones. También distinguimos cuatro tipos, a saber, la región (por ejemplo, todo un campus), sección (por ejemplo, un edificio o una sección al aire libre), nivel (por ejemplo, cierto piso en un edificio) y área (por ejemplo, una cierta habitación). Presentamos un quinto tipo de ubicación, que nos referimos como semánticos. Estas ubicaciones semánticas sucias pueden aparecer en cualquier nivel de la jerarquía y pueden anidarse, pero no necesariamente tienen una representación geográfica. Los ejemplos para tales ubicaciones semánticas son objetos etiquetados dentro de una habitación (por ejemplo, un escritorio y una impresora en este escritorio) o el nombre de un departamento, que contiene ciertas habitaciones. Figura 4. Jerarquía de contención de ubicación simbólica La jerarquía de ubicaciones simbólicas, así como el tipo de cada posición, se almacena en el repositorio de contexto.3.2 Sensores Nuestro arquitectura admite dos tipos diferentes de sensores: sensores de ubicación, que adquieren información de ubicación y sensores de proximidad, que detectan proximidades espaciales entre los usuarios. Como se describió anteriormente, cada sensor tiene un servidor, y en la mayoría de los casos una correspondiente implementación del lado del cliente también. Mientras que ClientAttributes (Sensor Abstraction) son responsables de adquirir datos de sensores de bajo nivel y transmitirlo al servidor, los atributos de encapsulación del sensor correspondiente los transforman en un formato uniforme e independiente del sensor, a saberproximidad, respectivamente.91 Posteriormente, la fusión del sensor de atributo respectivo se está activando con esta información independiente del sensor de cierto usuario, detectada por un sensor particular. Dichas notificaciones se realizan cada vez que el sensor adquiría nueva información. En consecuencia, los atributos de abstracción del sensor son responsables de detectar cuando un determinado sensor ya no está disponible en el lado del cliente (por ejemplo, si el usuario lo ha desenchufado) o cuándo la posición respectivamente no se puede determinar más (p. Ej. El lector de RFID no puede detectar etiquetas) y notifique a la fusión del sensor correspondiente sobre esto.3.2.1 Sensores de ubicación Para detectar posiciones físicas, el sensor encapsulationattribuye la información de posición dependiente del sensor asincrónicamente al servidor. Los atributos de abstracción del sensor de ubicación correspondiente recopilan estas posiciones físicas entregadas por los sensores de todos los usuarios, y realizan una mirada de repositorio para obtener la ubicación simbólica asociada. Esto requiere ciertas tablas para cada sensor, que asignan posiciones físicas a ubicaciones simbólicas. Una posición física puede tener múltiples ubicaciones simbólicas en diferentes niveles de precisión en la jerarquía de ubicación asignada, por ejemplo, si un sensor cubre varias habitaciones. Si se pudiera encontrar dicho mapeo, se lanza un evento para notificar a la fusión del sensor de ubicación del atributo sobre las ubicaciones simbólicas un determinado sensor de un usuario en particular determinado. Hemos implementado prototípicamente tres tipos de sensores de ubicación, que se basan en WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth y RFID (identificación de radiofrecuencia). Hemos elegido estos tres sensores completamente diferentes debido a sus diferencias con respecto a la precisión, la cobertura y el esfuerzo administrativo, para evaluar la flexibilidad de nuestro sistema (ver Tabla 1). El más preciso es un sensor RFID, que se basa en un lector RFID activo. Tan pronto como el lector está conectado al cliente, escanea las etiquetas RFID activas en el rango y transmite sus números de serie al servidor, donde se asignan a ubicaciones simbólicas. También tenemos en cuenta RSSI (información de resistencia a la señal de radio), que proporciona una precisión de posición de pocos centímetros y, por lo tanto, nos permite determinar qué RFID-TAG está más cerca. Debido a esta alta precisión, RFID se utiliza para localizar a los usuarios dentro de las habitaciones. La administración es bastante simple;Una vez que se coloca una nueva etiqueta RFID, su número de serie simplemente debe asignarse a una sola ubicación simbólica. Un inconveniente es la mala disponibilidad, que se remonta al hecho de que los lectores de RFID siguen siendo muy caros. El segundo es un sensor WLAN 802.11. Por lo tanto, integramos un sistema de posicionamiento WLAN comercial puramente basado en software para rastrear clientes en la infraestructura WLAN en todo el campus universitaria. La precisión de la posición alcanzada está en el rango de pocos metros y, por lo tanto, es adecuado para la detección de ubicación en la granularidad de las habitaciones. Una gran desventaja es que un mapa de toda el área debe calibrarse con puntos de medición a una distancia de 5 metros cada uno. Debido a que la mayoría de las computadoras móviles están equipadas con tecnología WLAN y el sistema de posicionamiento es una solución solo de software, casi todos pueden usar este tipo de sensor. Finalmente, hemos implementado un sensor Bluetooth, que detecta etiquetas Bluetooth (es decir, Bluetooth-Modules con posición conocida) en el rango y los transmite al servidor que se asigna a ubicaciones simbólicas. Debido al hecho de que no utilizamos la información de resistencia de la señal en la implementación actual, la precisión es superior a 10 metros y, por lo tanto, una sola dirección MAC Bluetooth está asociada con varias ubicaciones simbólicas, según las ubicaciones físicas como las cubiertas de módulos Bluetooth. Esto lleva a la desventaja de que el rango de cada etiqueta Bluetooth debe determinarse y asignarse a ubicaciones simbólicas dentro de este rango. Tabla 1. Comparación de sensores implementados Cobertura de precisión de sensores RFID <10 cm Pobre fácil Wlan 1-4 M muy bien muy bien muy bien TimeConsuming Bluetooth ~ 10 m bien que consumen mucho tiempo 3.2.2 Sensores de proximidad Cualquier sensor que pueda detectar si dos usuarios están en proximidad espacialse conoce como sensor de proximidad. Similar a los sensores de ubicación, los atributos del sensor de proximidad recopilan información de proximidad física de todos los usuarios y los transforman en asignaciones de ID de usuario. Hemos implementado dos tipos de sensores de proximidad, que se basan en Bluetooth por un lado y en ubicaciones simbólicas fusionadas (ver Capítulo 3.3.1) por otro lado. La implementación Bluetooth va junto con la implementación del sensor de ubicación basado en Bluetooth. Las direcciones MAC Bluetooth ya determinadas en el rango de cierto cliente se están comparando con las de todos los demás clientes, y cada vez que la abstracción del sensor Bluetooth de atributo detecta la congruencia, notifica la fusión del sensor de proximidad sobre esto. El segundo sensor se basa en ubicaciones simbólicas procesadas por la fusión del sensor de ubicación, por lo que no necesita una implementación del lado del cliente. Cada vez que cambia la ubicación simbólica fusionada de cierto usuario, verifica si está en la misma ubicación simbólica como otro usuario y nuevamente notifica la fusión del sensor de proximidad sobre la proximidad entre estos dos usuarios. El rango puede restringirse a cualquier nivel de la jerarquía de contención de ubicación, por ejemplo, a la granularidad de la habitación. Un problema actualmente no resuelto es la granularidad incomparable de diferentes sensores de proximidad. Por ejemplo, las ubicaciones simbólicas en el mismo nivel en la jerarquía de ubicación en su mayoría no cubren la misma área geográfica.3.3 El núcleo de fusión del sensor del subsistema de detección de ubicación es la fusión del sensor. Fusiona datos de varios sensores, mientras se enfrenta a las diferencias relacionadas con la precisión, la cobertura y la tasa de muestra. Según los dos tipos de sensores descritos en el Capítulo 3.2, distinguimos entre la fusión de sensores de ubicación, por un lado, y la fusión de sensores de proximidad por otro lado. La fusión de ubicaciones simbólicas, así como la fusión de proximidades espaciales opera con información estandarizada (cf. Figura 3). Esto tiene la ventaja de que los sensores de posición y proximidad adicionales se pueden agregar fácilmente o los algoritmos de fusión pueden ser reemplazados por aquellos que son más sofisticados.92 La fusión se realiza para cada usuario por separado y tiene en cuenta las mediciones en un solo punto en el tiempo (es decir, no se utiliza información de historial para determinar la ubicación actual de un cierto usuario). El algoritmo recopila todos los eventos lanzados por los atributos de abstracción del sensor, realiza fusión y desencadena el atributo del núcleo GISS si la ubicación simbólica de un cierto usuario o la proximidad espacial entre los usuarios cambió. Una característica importante es el almacenamiento persistente de historia de ubicación y proximidad en una base de datos para permitir la recuperación futura. Esto permite que las aplicaciones visualicen el movimiento de los usuarios, por ejemplo.3.3.1 El objetivo de fusión del sensor de ubicación de la fusión de la información de ubicación es mejorar la precisión y la precisión fusionando el conjunto de ubicaciones simbólicas suministradas por varios sensores de ubicación, para reducir el número de estas ubicaciones a un mínimo, idealmente a un solo simbólicoUbicación por usuario. Esto es bastante difícil, porque diferentes sensores pueden diferir en precisión y frecuencia de muestreo también. El atributo de fusión del sensor de ubicación se desencadena por eventos, que son lanzados por los abstracciones del sensor de ubicación. Estos eventos contienen información sobre la identidad del usuario en cuestión, su ubicación actual y el sensor por el cual se ha determinado la ubicación. Si la fusión del sensor de ubicación de atributo recibe dicho evento, verifica si la cantidad de ubicaciones simbólicas del usuario en cuestión ha cambiado (en comparación con el último evento). Si este es el caso, notifica el atributo del núcleo GISS sobre todas las ubicaciones simbólicas con las que este usuario está actualmente asociado. Sin embargo, esta información no es muy útil por sí sola si un cierto usuario está asociado con varias ubicaciones. Como se describe en el Capítulo 3.2.1, un sensor de ubicación única puede entregar múltiples ubicaciones simbólicas. Además, cierto usuario puede tener varios sensores de ubicación, que suministran ubicaciones simbólicas que difieren en precisión (es decir, diferentes niveles en la jerarquía de contención de ubicación). Para hacer frente a este desafío, implementamos un algoritmo de fusión para reducir el número de ubicaciones simbólicas al mínimo (idealmente para una sola ubicación). En un primer paso, cada ubicación simbólica está asociada con su número de ocurrencias. Una ubicación simbólica puede ocurrir varias veces si se hace referencia por más de un sensor o si un solo sensor detecta múltiples etiquetas, que nuevamente se refieren a varias ubicaciones. Además, este número se agrega al número previamente calculado de ocurrencias de cada ubicación simbólica, que es una ubicación infantil de la considerada en la jerarquía de contención de ubicación. Por ejemplo, si, en la Figura 4, la habitación2 ocurre dos veces y el escritorio ocurre una sola vez, el valor 2 de la habitación2 se agrega al valor 1 del escritorio, por el cual el escritorio finalmente obtiene el valor 3. En un paso final, solo se quedan esas ubicaciones simbólicas que se asignan con el mayor número de sucesos. Se puede lograr una reducción adicional asignando prioridades a los sensores (basados en la precisión y la confianza) y acumulando estas prioridades para cada ubicación simbólica en lugar de solo contar el número de ocurrencias. Si las ubicaciones fusionadas restantes han cambiado (es decir, si difieren de las ubicaciones fusionadas con las que el usuario considerado está actualmente asociado), se les proporciona la marca de tiempo actual, escrita en la base de datos y se notifica el atributo Giss sobre dónde está el usuario probablementesituado. Finalmente, se calcula la ubicación más precisa y común en la jerarquía de ubicación (es decir, el menor límite superior de estas ubicaciones simbólicas) para obtener una única ubicación simbólica. Si cambia, el atributo de núcleo GISS se activa nuevamente.3.3.2 Sensor de proximidad Fusión de proximidad de proximidad La fusión es mucho más simple que la fusión de ubicaciones simbólicas. El fusionAttribute del sensor de proximidad correspondiente se desencadena por eventos, que son lanzados por la abstracción del sensor de proximidad-atributos. Estos eventos especiales contienen información sobre la identidad de los dos usuarios en cuestión, si actualmente están en proximidad espacial o si la proximidad ya no persiste, y por el cual se ha detectado esto con sensor de proximidad. Si el atributo de fusión del sensor se notifica por un cierto atributo de abstracción del sensor de proximidad sobre una proximidad espacial existente, primero verifica si ya se sabe que estos dos usuarios están en proximidad (detectados por otro usuario o por otro sensor de proximidad delusuario, que causó el evento). Si no, este cambio en la proximidad se escribe en el repositorio de contexto con la marca de tiempo actual. Del mismo modo, si la fusión de proximidad del atributo se notifica sobre una proximidad final, verifica si se sabe que los usuarios están cerca, y escribe este cambio en el repositorio si no. Finalmente, si la proximidad espacial entre los dos usuarios realmente cambió, se lanza un evento para notificar al atributo de núcleo GISS sobre esto.4. Interacción sensible al contexto 4.1 Descripción general En la mayoría de los sistemas actuales que respaldan la interacción en grupos, los medios proporcionados carecen de cualquier conciencia del contexto actual de los usuarios, por lo que no puede adaptarse a sus necesidades. En nuestro enfoque, utilizamos información de contexto para mejorar la interacción y proporcionar servicios adicionales, que ofrecen nuevas posibilidades al usuario. Además, creemos que la interacción en los grupos también debe tener en cuenta el contexto actual del grupo mismo y no solo el contexto de los miembros del grupo individual. Por esta razón, también recuperamos información sobre el contexto actual de los grupos, derivados de los contextos de los miembros del grupo junto con algún tipo de metaceformación (ver Capítulo 4.3). Las fuentes de contexto utilizadas para nuestra aplicación se corresponden con los cuatro tipos de contexto primarios dados en el Capítulo 1.1 - Identidad (I), ubicación (L), Tiempo (T) y Actividad (A). Como se indicó anteriormente, también tenemos en cuenta el contexto del grupo con el que el usuario es interacción, para que podamos agregar un quinto tipo de conciencia de información de contexto (G) a la clasificación. Utilizando esta información de contexto, podemos activar actividades con el contexto en las tres categorías descritas en el Capítulo 1.1 - Presentación de la información (P), la ejecución automática de los servicios (a) y el etiquetado de contexto a la información para la recuperación posterior (t). La Tabla 2 ofrece una visión general de las actividades que ya hemos implementado;Se describen exhaustivamente en el Capítulo 4.4. La tabla también muestra qué tipos de información de contexto se utilizan para cada actividad y la categoría de la actividad podría clasificarse. 93 Tabla 2. Clasificación del servicio implementado de actividades con el contexto L T I A G P P A T Ubicación Visualización X X X Soporte de construcción de grupos X X X X X Soporte para comunicación sincrónica x x x x Soporte para la comunicación asíncrona x x x x x x gestión de disponibilidad x x x soporte de gestión de tareas x x x soporte de reunión X x x x x razones para implementar estas características para aprovechar todos los cuatro tiposde información de contexto para apoyar la interacción grupal utilizando un conocimiento integral sobre la situación en la que se encuentra un solo usuario o un grupo completo. Un problema crítico para la aceptación del usuario de dicho sistema es la usabilidad de su interfaz. Hemos evaluado varias formas de presentar medios de interacción conscientes del contexto para el usuario, hasta que llegamos a la solución que usamos en este momento. Aunque creemos que la interfaz de usuario que se ha implementado ahora ofrece la mejor compensación entre la integración perfecta de las características y la facilidad de uso, no sería un problema extender la arquitectura con otras interfaces de usuario, incluso en diferentes plataformas. La solución elegida se basa en un mensajero instantáneo existente, que ofrece varias posibilidades para integrar nuestro sistema (ver Capítulo 4.2). La mayor ventaja de este enfoque es que el usuario se enfrenta a una interfaz gráfica de usuario a la que ya está acostumbrado en la mayoría de los casos. Además, nuestro sistema utiliza una cuenta de mensajero instantáneo como identificador, de modo que el usuario no tenga que registrar una cuenta adicional en ningún otro lugar (por ejemplo, el usuario puede usar su cuenta ICQ2 ya existente).4.2 Integración de mensajería instantánea Nuestro sistema se basa en un mensajero instantáneo existente, el Socalled Simple Instant Messenger (SIM) 3. La implementación de este mensajero se lleva a cabo como un proyecto en SourceForge4. SIM admite múltiples protocolos de mensajería como AIM5, ICQ2 y MSN6. También admite conexiones a múltiples cuentas al mismo tiempo. Además, se proporciona el soporte total para la notificación SMS (donde se proporciona desde el protocolo usado). SIM se basa en un concepto de complemento. Todos los protocolos y partes de la interfaz de usuario se implementan como complementos. Su arquitectura también se utiliza para extender las habilidades de aplicaciones para comunicarse con aplicaciones externas. Para este propósito, se proporciona un complemento de control remoto, mediante el cual SIM se puede controlar desde aplicaciones externas a través de Socket Connection. GISS utiliza ampliamente esta interfaz de control remoto para recuperar la lista de contactos, establecer el estado de disponibilidad de usuarios o enviar mensajes. 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ La funcionalidad del complemento se extendió de varias maneras, por ejemplo, para aceptar mensajes parauna cuenta (como si hubieran sido enviadas a través de la red de mensajería). El mensajero, más exactamente la lista de contactos (es decir, una lista de perfiles de todas las personas registradas con el mensajero instantáneo, que se visualiza al enumerar sus nombres como se puede ver en la Figura 5), también se usa para mostrar ubicaciones de otros miembros delos grupos a los que pertenece un usuario. Esto proporciona conciencia de ubicación sin llevar demasiado espacio o solicitar a los usuarios toda la atención. Una descripción más completa de estas características se da en el Capítulo 4.4.4.3 Fuentes de información de contexto Si bien el contexto de ubicación de un usuario se obtiene de nuestro subsistema de detección de ubicación descrito en el Capítulo 3, consideramos más tipos de contexto que la ubicación relevante para el soporte de la interacción grupal también. La hora local como una dimensión de contexto muy importante se puede recuperar fácilmente del reloj en tiempo real del sistema de usuarios. Además de la ubicación y el tiempo, también utilizamos información de contexto de la actividad y la identidad de los usuarios, donde explotamos la funcionalidad proporcionada por el sistema de mensajeros instantáneos subyacentes. La identidad (o más exactamente, la asignación de ID a los nombres, así como la información adicional del perfil de los usuarios) se puede destilarse fuera del contenido de la lista de contactos de los usuarios. La información sobre la actividad o cierto usuario solo está disponible en un área muy restringida, a saber, la actividad en la propia computadora. Otras actividades como hacer una llamada telefónica o algo similar, no se pueden reconocer con la implementación actual del sensor de actividad. La única información de contexto utilizada es el estado de disponibilidad de mensajeros instantáneos, por lo que solo proporciona una clasificación muy gruesa de la actividad de los usuarios (en línea, fuera de línea, lejos, ocupado, etc.). Aunque esto puede no ser muy información, seguramente es relevante y puede usarse para mejorar o incluso habilitar varios servicios. Habiendo recopilado la información de contexto de todos los usuarios disponibles, ahora es posible destilar cierta información sobre el contexto de un determinado grupo. La información sobre el contexto de un grupo incluye cuántos miembros tiene actualmente el grupo, si el grupo se reúne en este momento, qué miembros participan en una reunión, cuántos miembros han leído cuál de las publicaciones disponibles de otros miembros del equipo, etc. Por lo tanto, se necesita información adicional como una lista de miembros para cada grupo. Estas listas se pueden ensamblar manualmente (por los usuarios que unen y dejan grupos) o se recuperan automáticamente. El contexto de un grupo es el contexto secundario y se agrega de los contextos disponibles de los miembros del grupo. Cada vez que cambia el contexto de un solo miembro del grupo, el contexto de todo el grupo está cambiando y debe recalcularse. Con el conocimiento sobre el contexto de los usuarios y el contexto de los grupos a los que pertenece, podemos proporcionar varios servicios conscientes del contexto al usuario, lo que mejoran sus habilidades de interacción. Una breve descripción de estos servicios se da en el Capítulo 4.4.94 4.4 Soporte de interacción grupal 4.4.1 Visualización de la información de ubicación Una característica importante es la visualización de la información de ubicación, lo que permite a los usuarios conocer la ubicación de otros usuarios y miembros de los grupos a los que se unió, respectivamente. Como ya se describió en el Capítulo 2, utilizamos dos formas diferentes de visualización. La quizás más importante es mostrar información de ubicación en la lista de contactos del mensajero instantáneo, justo al lado del nombre, por lo que siempre es visible sin atraer la atención de los usuarios (en comparación con una vista de dos moderno, que requiere una ventana propia.para mostrar un mapa del entorno). Debido al espacio restringido en la lista de contactos, ha sido necesario implementar algún tipo de concepto de nivel de detección. A medida que utilizamos un modelo de ubicación jerárquica, podemos determinar la ubicación común más precisa de dos usuarios. En la lista de contactos, se muestra la ubicación simbólica actual un nivel por debajo de la ubicación común previamente calculada. Si, por ejemplo, el usuario A actualmente reside en la habitación P121 en el primer piso de un edificio y el usuario B, que debe mostrarse en la lista de contactos del usuario A, está en la habitación P304 en el tercer piso, la ubicación común más precisaDe estos dos usuarios es el edificio en el que se encuentran. Por esa razón, el piso (es decir, un nivel más allá de la ubicación común, a saber, el edificio) del usuario B se muestra en la lista de contactos del usuario A. Si ambas personas residen en el mismo piso o incluso en la misma habitación, se tomaría la habitación. La Figura 5 muestra una captura de pantalla del simple Messenger3 instantáneo3, donde la ubicación actual de esas personas, cuya ubicación es conocida por GISS, se muestra entre paréntesis justo al lado de su nombre. Además de la imagen, se muestra el giss-toolbar integrado e integrado, que actualmente contiene la siguiente funcionalidad implementada (de izquierda a derecha): comunicación asincrónica para grupos (ver Capítulo 4.4.4), Recordatorios de contexto (ver Capítulo4.4.6), Visualización bidimensional de la información de ubicación, formación y gestión de grupos (ver Capítulo 4.4.2), gestión de disponibilidad con el contexto (ver Capítulo 4.4.5) y finalmente un botón para terminar GISS. Figura 5. La integración GISS en el mensajero instantáneo simple3 como mostrar solo esta forma breve de ubicación puede no ser suficiente para el usuario, porque es posible que desee ver la posición más precisa disponible, se muestra una posición totalmente calificada si se hace clic en un nombre en la lista de contacto(por ejemplo, en forma de escritorio@room2@department1@1stfloor@edificio 1@campus). La segunda forma posible de visualización es gráfica. Hemos evaluado una vista tridimensional, que se basó en un modelo VRML del área respectiva (cf. Figura 6). Debido a la falta de problemas de navegación y usabilidad, decidimos usar una vista bidimensional del piso (se conoce como nivel en la jerarquía de ubicación, cf. Figura 4). También se proporcionan otros niveles de granularidad como la sección (por ejemplo, la construcción) y la región (por ejemplo, el campus). En esta vista basada en plano de piso, las ubicaciones actuales se muestran a la manera de los contactos ICQ2, que se colocan en la ubicación de la persona respectiva. El estado de disponibilidad de un usuario, por ejemplo, si no está en la computadora en este momento, o ocupado si no quiere ser perturbado, se visualiza con la fuente de color de ICQ2, izquierda al lado del nombre. Además, la visión del plano del piso muestra los llamados post-its virtuales, que son contrapartes virtuales de la vida real y sirven como nuestro medio de comunicación asincrónica (más sobre los post-it virtuales se pueden encontrar en el Capítulo 4.4.4). Figura 6. Vista 3D del piso (VRML) La Figura 7 muestra el mapa bidimensional de un piso determinado, donde se encuentran actualmente varios usuarios (visualizados por su nombre y la flor que queda al lado). La ubicación del cliente, en el que se muestra el mapa, se visualiza mediante un círculo verde. A la derecha, se pueden ver dos postes virtuales. Figura 7. Vista 2D del piso Otra característica de la visión 2D es la visualización de UbicationHistory de los usuarios. A medida que almacenamos el historial completo de las ubicaciones de los usuarios junto con una marca de tiempo, podemos proporcionar información sobre las ubicaciones que ha estado en el tiempo. Cuando el mouse se mueve por el nombre de cierto usuario en la vista 2, las huellas de un usuario, colocadas en las ubicaciones que ha sido, se desvanecen más fuerte, cuanto más antigua sea la información de ubicación.95 4.4.2 Formación y administración de grupos para apoyar la interacción en grupos, primero es necesario formar grupos. Como los grupos pueden tener diferentes propósitos, distinguimos dos tipos de grupos. Los llamados grupos estáticos son grupos, que son construidos manualmente por personas que se unen y los dejan. Los grupos estáticos pueden dividirse aún más en dos subtipos. En grupos estáticos abiertos, todos pueden unirse y irse en cualquier momento, por ejemplo, para formar un grupo de asistentes a la conferencia de algún tipo de grupo de interés. Los grupos estáticos cerrados tienen un propietario, que decide, a qué personas pueden unirse, aunque todos podrían irse nuevamente en cualquier momento. Los grupos cerrados permiten a los usuarios, por ejemplo, crear un grupo de sus amigos, lo que puede comunicarse con ellos fácilmente. En contraste con eso, también apoyamos la creación de grupos dinámicos. Están formados entre las personas, que están en el mismo lugar al mismo tiempo. La creación de grupos dinámicos solo se realiza en ubicaciones, donde tiene sentido formar grupos, por ejemplo, en salas de conferencias o salas de reuniones, pero no en pasillos o al aire libre. Tampoco sería muy significativo formar un grupo solo de las personas que residen en el sector frontal izquierdo de un salón;En cambio, se debe considerar el salón completo. Por estas razones, se etiquetan todas las ubicaciones definidas en la jerarquía, ya sea que permitan la formación de grupos o no. Los grupos dinámicos también no solo forman granularidad de habitaciones, sino también en niveles más altos en la jerarquía, por ejemplo, con las personas que actualmente residen en el área de un departamento. A medida que los miembros de los grupos dinámicos cambian constantemente, es posible crear un grupo estático abierto a partir de ellos.4.4.3 Comunicación sincrónica para grupos La forma más importante de comunicación sincrónica en las computadoras hoy en día es la mensajería instantánea;Algunas personas incluso ven mensajes instantáneos para ser la aplicación asesina real en Internet. Esto también ha motivado la decisión de construir GISS en un sistema de mensajería instantánea. En los sistemas de mensajeros de hoy, la comunicación entre pares es ampliamente compatible. Sin embargo, cuando se trata de comunicación en grupos, el apoyo es bastante pobre la mayor parte del tiempo. A menudo, solo es compatible con el envío de un mensaje a múltiples destinatarios, carece de medios para tener en cuenta el estado actual de los destinatarios. Además, los grupos solo se pueden formar de miembros en la lista de contactos de otros, por lo que no pueden enviar mensajes a un grupo, donde no todos sus miembros son conocidos (que pueden ser el caso en el entorno, donde los participantes de una conferencia forman ungrupo). Nuestro enfoque no tiene las restricciones mencionadas. Introducimos las entradas grupales en la lista de contactos de los usuarios;Permitirle fácilmente enviar mensajes a este grupo, sin saber quién exactamente es actualmente miembro de este grupo. Además, los mensajes grupales solo se entregan a las personas, que actualmente no están ocupadas, evitando así una perturbación por un mensaje, que posiblemente no es importante para el usuario. Estas características no se pueden llevar a cabo en la misma red de mensajería, por lo que cada vez que se envía un mensaje a una cuenta grupal, lo intercepemos y lo enrollamos a través de nuestro sistema a todos los destinatarios, que están disponibles en un momento determinado. La comunicación a través de una cuenta grupal también se almacena centralmente, lo que permite a las personas consultar mensajes perdidos o simplemente ver el historial de mensajes.4.4.4 La comunicación asincrónica para grupos La comunicación asincrónica en grupos no es una idea nueva. El objetivo de este enfoque no es reinventar la rueda, ya que el correo electrónico es quizás la forma más utilizada de comunicación asincrónica en las computadoras y está ampliamente aceptada y estandarizada. En el trabajo, apuntamos a la combinación de comunicación asincrónica con la conciencia de la ubicación. Por esta razón, presentamos el concepto de los llamados postits virtuales (Cp. [13]), que son mensajes que están vinculados a ubicaciones físicas. Estos postes virtuales podrían ser visibles para todos los usuarios que pasan o pueden restringirse a ser visibles solo para ciertos grupos de personas. Además, un post-IT virtual también puede tener una fecha de vencimiento después de la cual se deja caer y ya no se muestra. Otros también pueden comentar postes virtuales, proporcionando algunos de la interacción similar al foro, donde cada post-IT forma un hilo. Los post-it virtuales se muestran automáticamente, cada vez que un usuario (disponible) pasa por primera vez. Posteriormente, se puede acceder a Post-It a través del Viewer 2D, donde se muestran todos los post-IT visibles. Todos los lectores de un post-IT se registran y se muestran al verlo, proporcionando algún tipo de conciencia sobre las actividades de los miembros del grupo en el pasado.4.4.5 Los mensajeros instantáneos de gestión de disponibilidad consciente del contexto en general proporcionan algún tipo de información de disponibilidad sobre un usuario. Aunque esta información solo se puede definir en una granularidad muy gruesa, hemos decidido utilizar estos medios para recopilar el contexto de actividad, porque la introducción de uno adicional disminuiría fuertemente la usabilidad del sistema. Para apoyar al usuario que administra su disponibilidad, proporcionamos una interfaz que permite al usuario definir las reglas para adaptar su disponibilidad al contexto actual. Estas reglas siguen el formulario en el evento (e) si la condición (c) entonces la acción (a), que está directamente respaldada por las eca-reglas del marco de contexto descrito en el Capítulo 1.3. La prueba de condiciones se desencadena periódicamente lanzando eventos (cada vez que cambia el contexto de un usuario). La condición en sí está definida por el usuario, que puede exigir el cambio de su estado de disponibilidad como acción en la regla. Como condición, el usuario puede definir su ubicación, un cierto tiempo (que también se desencadena diariamente, cada semana o cada mes) o cualquier combinación lógica de estos criterios.4.4.6 Los recordatorios de los recordatorios conscientes del contexto [14] se utilizan para dar al usuario la oportunidad de definir tareas y recordarlos, cuando se cumplen ciertos criterios. Por lo tanto, un recordatorio puede verse como un post-it para uno mismo, que solo es visible en ciertos casos. Los recordatorios pueden estar vinculados a un determinado lugar o tiempo, pero también a la proximidad espacial de usuarios o grupos. Estos criterios se pueden combinar con operadores booleanos, proporcionando así un medio poderoso para recordarle al usuario tareas que quiere llevar a cabo cuando ocurre un cierto contexto. Un recordatorio solo aparecerá la primera vez que el contexto real cumple con el criterio definido. Al mostrar el recordatorio, el usuario tiene la oportunidad de volver a enviarlo para recordarlo nuevamente, por ejemplo, cinco minutos después o la próxima vez que un cierto usuario esté en proximidad espacial.96 4.4.7 Reconocimiento y notificación del contexto de las reuniones grupales con la información de contexto disponible, tratamos de reconocer las reuniones de un grupo. La determinación de los criterios, cuando el sistema reconoce a un grupo que tiene una reunión, es parte del trabajo en curso. En un primer enfoque, utilizamos el contexto de ubicación y actividad de los miembros del grupo para determinar una reunión. Siempre que más del 50 % de los miembros de un grupo estén disponibles en un lugar, donde se considera que una reunión tiene sentido (por ejemplo, no en un corredor), se crea una reunión después de este lugar y todos los miembros del grupo ausentes sonnotificado de la reunión y la ubicación que tiene lugar. Durante la reunión, la función de comentarios de Post-It virtual proporciona un medio para tomar notas para todos los participantes. Cuando los miembros se unen o abandonan la reunión, esto se agrega automáticamente como una nota de la lista de comentarios. Al igual que el reconocimiento del comienzo de una reunión, el reconocimiento de su fin sigue siendo parte del trabajo en curso. Si se reconoce el final de la reunión, todos los miembros del grupo obtienen la lista completa de comentarios como protocolo de reunión al final de la reunión.5. Conclusiones Este documento discutió los potenciales de apoyo para la interacción grupal mediante el uso de información de contexto. Primero, introdujimos las nociones de la computación de contexto y del contexto y motivamos su valor para apoyar la interacción grupal. Se presenta una arquitectura para admitir la interacción grupal consciente de contexto en entornos distribuidos móviles. Se basa en un marco flexible y extensible, lo que permite una fácil adopción de fuentes de contexto disponibles (por ejemplo, agregando sensores adicionales), así como la forma requerida de representación. Hemos desarrollado prototípicamente un conjunto de servicios, que mejoran la interacción grupal teniendo en cuenta el contexto actual de los usuarios, así como el contexto de los grupos en sí. Las características importantes son la formación dinámica de los grupos, la visualización de la ubicación en un mapa bidimensional, así como integra integrados en una comunicación asincrónica instantánea por post-its virtuales, que están vinculados a ciertas ubicaciones, y una disponibilidad consciente del contexto.Gestión, que adapta el estado de disponibilidad de un usuario a su situación actual. Para proporcionar información de ubicación, hemos implementado un subsistema para la adquisición automatizada de la información de ubicación y proximidad proporcionada por varios sensores, que proporciona una presentación independiente de la tecnología de ubicaciones y proximidades espaciales entre usuarios y fusiona esta información utilizando algoritmos de fusión independientes del sensor. Una historia de ubicaciones, así como de proximidades espaciales se almacena en una base de datos, lo que permite los servicios basados en la historia del contexto.6.

        "Context Awareness for Group Interaction Support Alois Ferscha, Clemens Holzmann, Stefan Oppl Institut für Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz Altenbergerstraße 69, A-4040 Linz {ferscha,holzmann,oppl}@soft.uni-linz.ac.at ABSTRACT In this paper, we present an implemented system for supporting group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments.",
        "First, an introduction to context computing and a motivation for using contextual information to facilitate group interaction is given.",
        "We then present the architecture of our system, which consists of two parts: a subsystem for location sensing that acquires information about the location of users as well as spatial proximities between them, and one for the actual context-aware application, which provides services for group interaction.",

        "H.5.3 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces - asynchronous interaction, collaborative computing, theory and models, synchronous interaction.",
        "General Terms Design, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Todays computing environments are characterized by an increasing number of powerful, wirelessly connected mobile devices.",
        "Users can move throughout an environment while carrying their computers with them and having remote access to information and services, anytime and anywhere.",
        "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
        "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
        "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",
        "It supports group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments in a way that group members need not to at the same place any longer in order to interact with each other or just to be aware of the others situation.",
        "In the following subchapters, we will give a short overview on context aware computing and motivate its benefits for supporting group interaction.",
        "A software framework for developing contextsensitive applications is presented, which serves as middleware for GISS.",
        "Chapter 2 presents the architecture of GISS, and chapter 3 and 4 discuss the location sensing and group interaction concepts of GISS in more detail.",
        "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
        "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
        "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
        "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
        "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
        "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
        "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
        "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
        "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
        "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
        "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
        "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
        "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
        "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
        "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
        "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
        "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
        "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
        "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
        "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
        "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
        "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
        "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
        "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
        "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
        "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
        "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
        "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
        "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
        "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
        "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
        "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
        "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
        "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
        "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
        "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
        "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
        "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
        "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
        "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
        "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
        "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
        "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
        "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
        "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
        "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
        "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
        "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
        "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
        "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
        "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
        "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
        "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
        "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
        "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
        "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
        "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
        "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
        "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
        "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
        "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
        "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
        "Figure 3.",
        "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
        "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
        "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
        "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
        "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
        "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
        "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
        "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
        "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
        "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
        "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
        "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
        "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
        "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
        "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
        "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
        "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
        "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
        "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3.",
        "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
        "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
        "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
        "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
        "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
        "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
        "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
        "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
        "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
        "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
        "Figure 4.",
        "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
        "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
        "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
        "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
        "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
        "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
        "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
        "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
        "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
        "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
        "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
        "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
        "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
        "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
        "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
        "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
        "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
        "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
        "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
        "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
        "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
        "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
        "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
        "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
        "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
        "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
        "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Comparison of implemented sensors Sensor Accuracy Coverage Administration RFID < 10 cm poor easy WLAN 1-4 m very well very timeconsuming Bluetooth ~ 10 m well time-consuming 3.2.2 Proximity Sensors Any sensor that is able to detect whether two users are in spatial proximity is referred to as proximity sensor.",
        "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",
        "We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand.",
        "The Bluetooth-implementation goes along with the implementation of the Bluetooth-based location sensor.",
        "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",
        "The second sensor is based on symbolic locations processed by Location Sensor Fusion, wherefore it does not need a client-side implementation.",
        "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
        "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
        "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
        "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",
        "It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate.",
        "According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand.",
        "The fusion of symbolic locations as well as the fusion of spatial proximities operates on standardized information (cf.",
        "Figure 3).",
        "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
        "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
        "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
        "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
        "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
        "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
        "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
        "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
        "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
        "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
        "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
        "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
        "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
        "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
        "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
        "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
        "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
        "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
        "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
        "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
        "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
        "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
        "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
        "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
        "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
        "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
        "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
        "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",
        "CONTEXTSENSITIVE INTERACTION 4.1 Overview In most of todays systems supporting interaction in groups, the provided means lack any awareness of the users current context, thus being unable to adapt to his needs.",
        "In our approach, we use context information to enhance interaction and provide further services, which offer new possibilities to the user.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that interaction in groups also has to take into account the current context of the group itself and not only the context of individual group members.",
        "For this reason, we also retrieve information about the groups current context, derived from the contexts of the group members together with some sort of meta-information (see chapter 4.3).",
        "The sources of context used for our application correspond with the four primary context types given in chapter 1.1 - identity (I), location (L), time (T) and activity (A).",
        "As stated before, we also take into account the context of the group the user is interaction with, so that we could add a fifth type of context informationgroup awareness (G) - to the classification.",
        "Using this context information, we can trigger context-aware activities in all of the three categories described in chapter 1.1 - presentation of information (P), automatic execution of services (A) and tagging of context to information for later retrieval (T).",
        "Table 2 gives an overview of activities we have already implemented; they are described comprehensively in chapter 4.4.",
        "The table also shows which types of context information are used for each activity and the category the activity could be classified in. 93 Table 2.",
        "Classification of implemented context-aware activities Service L T I A G P A T Location Visualisation X X X Group Building Support X X X X Support for Synchronous Communication X X X X Support for Asynchronous Communication X X X X X X X Availability Management X X X Task Management Support X X X X Meeting Support X X X X X X Reasons for implementing these very features are to take advantage of all four types of context information in order to support group interaction by utilizing a comprehensive knowledge about the situation a single user or a whole group is in.",
        "A critical issue for the user acceptance of such a system is the usability of its interface.",
        "We have evaluated several ways of presenting context-aware means of interaction to the user, until we came to the solution we use right now.",
        "Although we think that the user interface that has been implemented now offers the best trade-off between seamless integration of features and ease of use, it would be no problem to extend the architecture with other user interfaces, even on different platforms.",
        "The chosen solution is based on an existing instant messenger, which offers several possibilities to integrate our system (see chapter 4.2).",
        "The biggest advantage of this approach is that the user is confronted with a graphical user interface he is already used to in most cases.",
        "Furthermore, our system uses an instant messenger account as an identifier, so that the user does not have to register a further account anywhere else (for example, the user can use his already existing ICQ2 -account). 4.2 Instant Messenger Integration Our system is based upon an existing instant messenger, the socalled Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
        "The implementation of this messenger is carried out as a project at Sourceforge4 .",
        "SIM supports multiple messenger protocols such as AIM5 , ICQ2 and MSN6 .",
        "It also supports connections to multiple accounts at the same time.",
        "Furthermore, full support for SMS-notification (where provided from the used protocol) is given.",
        "SIM is based on a plug-in concept.",
        "All protocols as well as parts of the user-interface are implemented as plug-ins.",
        "Its architecture is also used to extend the applications abilities to communicate with external applications.",
        "For this purpose, a remote control plug-in is provided, by which SIM can be controlled from external applications via socket connection.",
        "This remote control interface is extensively used by GISS for retrieving the contact list, setting the users availability-state or sending messages.",
        "The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network).",
        "The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to.",
        "This provides location awareness without taking too much space or requesting the users full attention.",
        "A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too.",
        "Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system.",
        "Besides location and time, we also use context information of users activity and identity, where we exploit the functionality provided by the underlying instant messenger system.",
        "Identity (or more exactly, the mapping of IDs to names as well as additional information from the users profile) can be distilled out of the contents of the users contact list.",
        "Information about the activity or a certain user is only available in a very restricted area, namely the activity at the computer itself.",
        "Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor.",
        "The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.).",
        "Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services.",
        "Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group.",
        "Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on.",
        "Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed.",
        "These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically.",
        "The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members.",
        "Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated.",
        "With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities.",
        "A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively.",
        "As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation.",
        "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
        "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",
        "As we use a hierarchical location model, we are able to determine the most accurate common location of two users.",
        "In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed.",
        "If, for example, user A currently resides in room P121 at the first floor of a building and user B, which has to be displayed in the contact list of user A, is in room P304 at the third floor, the most accurate common location of these two users is the building they are in.",
        "For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A.",
        "If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken.",
        "Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name.",
        "On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS.",
        "Figure 5.",
        "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
        "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
        "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",
        "Figure 6).",
        "Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf.",
        "Figure 4).",
        "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
        "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
        "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
        "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
        "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
        "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",
        "Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen.",
        "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
        "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
        "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
        "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
        "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
        "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
        "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
        "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
        "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
        "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
        "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
        "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
        "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
        "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
        "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
        "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
        "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
        "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
        "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
        "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
        "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
        "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
        "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
        "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
        "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
        "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
        "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
        "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
        "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
        "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
        "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
        "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
        "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
        "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
        "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
        "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
        "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
        "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
        "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
        "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
        "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
        "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
        "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
        "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
        "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
        "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
        "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
        "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
        "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
        "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
        "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
        "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
        "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
        "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
        "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
        "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
        "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
        "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
        "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
        "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
        "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
                "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",
                "It supports group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments in a way that group members need not to at the same place any longer in order to interact with each other or just to be aware of the others situation.",

                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves.

                "Furthermore, we believe that interaction in groups also has to take into account the current context of the group itself and not only the context of individual group members.",
                "For this reason, we also retrieve information about the groups current context, derived from the contexts of the group members together with some sort of meta-information (see chapter 4.3).",
                "The sources of context used for our application correspond with the four primary context types given in chapter 1.1 - identity (I), location (L), time (T) and activity (A).",

                "The chosen solution is based on an existing instant messenger, which offers several possibilities to integrate our system (see chapter 4.2).",
                "The biggest advantage of this approach is that the user is confronted with a graphical user interface he is already used to in most cases.",
                "Furthermore, our system uses an instant messenger account as an identifier, so that the user does not have to register a further account anywhere else (for example, the user can use his already existing ICQ2 -account). 4.2 Instant Messenger Integration Our system is based upon an existing instant messenger, the socalled Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",

                "The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network).",
                "The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to.",

                "A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too.",
                "Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system.",
                "Besides location and time, we also use context information of users activity and identity, where we exploit the functionality provided by the underlying instant messenger system.",
                "Identity (or more exactly, the mapping of IDs to names as well as additional information from the users profile) can be distilled out of the contents of the users contact list.",
                "Information about the activity or a certain user is only available in a very restricted area, namely the activity at the computer itself.",
                "Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor.",
                "The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.).",
                "Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services.",
                "Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group.",
                "Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on.",
                "Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed.",
                "These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically.",
                "The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members.",
                "Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated.",
                "With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities.",
                "A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively.",
                "As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation.",
                "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
                "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",
                "As we use a hierarchical location model, we are able to determine the most accurate common location of two users.",
                "In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed.",

                "For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A.",
                "If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken.",
                "Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name.",
                "On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS.",
                "Figure 5.",
                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",
                "Figure 6).",
                "Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf.",
                "Figure 4).",
                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",
                "Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen.",
                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "First, an introduction to context computing and a motivation for using contextual information to facilitate <br>group interaction</br> is given.",
                "We then present the architecture of our system, which consists of two parts: a subsystem for location sensing that acquires information about the location of users as well as spatial proximities between them, and one for the actual context-aware application, which provides services for <br>group interaction</br>.",

                "Users can move throughout an environment while carrying their computers with them and having remote access to information and services, anytime and anywhere.",
                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
                "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as <br>group interaction</br> Support System (GISS).",
                "It supports <br>group interaction</br> in mobile distributed computing environments in a way that group members need not to at the same place any longer in order to interact with each other or just to be aware of the others situation.",
                "In the following subchapters, we will give a short overview on context aware computing and motivate its benefits for supporting <br>group interaction</br>.",
                "A software framework for developing contextsensitive applications is presented, which serves as middleware for GISS.",
                "Chapter 2 presents the architecture of GISS, and chapter 3 and 4 discuss the location sensing and <br>group interaction</br> concepts of GISS in more detail.",
                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 <br>group interaction</br> in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
                "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
                "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
                "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "<br>group interaction</br> includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting <br>group interaction</br> comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing <br>group interaction</br> systems.",
                "Context information facilitates <br>group interaction</br> by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support <br>group interaction</br>, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
                "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting <br>group interaction</br>, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of <br>group interaction</br>, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The <br>group interaction</br> Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the <br>group interaction</br> Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of <br>group interaction</br> support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
                "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
                "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
                "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
                "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting <br>group interaction</br> in more detail. 3.",
                "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
                "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
                "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
                "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
                "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
                "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
                "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
                "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
                "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
                "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
                "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
                "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
                "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
                "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
                "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
                "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
                "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
                "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
                "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
                "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
                "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
                "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
                "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
                "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
                "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",
                "Table 1.",
                "Comparison of implemented sensors Sensor Accuracy Coverage Administration RFID < 10 cm poor easy WLAN 1-4 m very well very timeconsuming Bluetooth ~ 10 m well time-consuming 3.2.2 Proximity Sensors Any sensor that is able to detect whether two users are in spatial proximity is referred to as proximity sensor.",
                "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",
                "We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand.",

                "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",
                "The second sensor is based on symbolic locations processed by Location Sensor Fusion, wherefore it does not need a client-side implementation.",
                "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
                "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",

                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
                "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
                "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",

                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for <br>group interaction</br> by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting <br>group interaction</br>.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware <br>group interaction</br> in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",

                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",

                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
                "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
                "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
                "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
                "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",

                "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
                "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",
                "As we use a hierarchical location model, we are able to determine the most accurate common location of two users.",
                "In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed.",
                "If, for example, user A currently resides in room P121 at the first floor of a building and user B, which has to be displayed in the contact list of user A, is in room P304 at the third floor, the most accurate common location of these two users is the building they are in.",
                "For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A.",
                "If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken.",
                "Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name.",
                "On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS.",
                "Figure 5.",
                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",
                "Figure 6).",
                "Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf.",
                "Figure 4).",
                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",

                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",

                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",

                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be <br>contextaware</br> if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",

                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",

                "SIM supports multiple messenger protocols such as AIM5 , ICQ2 and MSN6 .",

                "The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network).",
                "The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to.",
                "This provides location awareness without taking too much space or requesting the users full attention.",
                "A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too.",
                "Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system.",
                "Besides location and time, we also use context information of users activity and identity, where we exploit the functionality provided by the underlying instant messenger system.",
                "Identity (or more exactly, the mapping of IDs to names as well as additional information from the users profile) can be distilled out of the contents of the users contact list.",
                "Information about the activity or a certain user is only available in a very restricted area, namely the activity at the computer itself.",
                "Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor.",
                "The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.).",
                "Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services.",
                "Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group.",
                "Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on.",
                "Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed.",
                "These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically.",
                "The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members.",
                "Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated.",
                "With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities.",
                "A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively.",
                "As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation.",
                "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
                "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",
                "As we use a hierarchical location model, we are able to determine the most accurate common location of two users.",
                "In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed.",
                "If, for example, user A currently resides in room P121 at the first floor of a building and user B, which has to be displayed in the contact list of user A, is in room P304 at the third floor, the most accurate common location of these two users is the building they are in.",
                "For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A.",
                "If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken.",
                "Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name.",
                "On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS.",
                "Figure 5.",
                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",
                "Figure 6).",
                "Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf.",
                "Figure 4).",
                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",
                "Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen.",
                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "Chapter 2 presents the architecture of GISS, and chapter 3 and 4 discuss the location sensing and group interaction concepts of GISS in more detail.",
                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
                "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
                "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
                "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
                "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
                "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
                "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
                "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
                "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3.",
                "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
                "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
                "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
                "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
                "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
                "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
                "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
                "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
                "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
                "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
                "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
                "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
                "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
                "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
                "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
                "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
                "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
                "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
                "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
                "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
                "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
                "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
                "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
                "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
                "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",

                "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",
                "We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand.",
                "The Bluetooth-implementation goes along with the implementation of the Bluetooth-based location sensor.",
                "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",
                "The second sensor is based on symbolic locations processed by Location Sensor Fusion, wherefore it does not need a client-side implementation.",
                "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
                "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",
                "It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate.",
                "According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand.",
                "The fusion of symbolic locations as well as the fusion of spatial proximities operates on standardized information (cf.",
                "Figure 3).",
                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
                "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
                "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",

                "In our approach, we use context information to enhance interaction and provide further services, which offer new possibilities to the user.",
                "Furthermore, we believe that interaction in groups also has to take into account the current context of the group itself and not only the context of individual group members.",
                "For this reason, we also retrieve information about the groups current context, derived from the contexts of the group members together with some sort of meta-information (see chapter 4.3).",

                "The chosen solution is based on an existing instant messenger, which offers several possibilities to integrate our system (see chapter 4.2).",
                "The biggest advantage of this approach is that the user is confronted with a graphical user interface he is already used to in most cases.",

                "The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network).",
                "The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to.",

                "A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too.",
                "Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system.",

                "Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor.",
                "The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.).",
                "Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services.",
                "Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group.",
                "Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on.",
                "Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed.",
                "These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically.",
                "The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members.",
                "Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated.",
                "With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities.",
                "A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively.",
                "As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation.",
                "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
                "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",

                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",

                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",
                "Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen.",
                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "Users can move throughout an environment while carrying their computers with them and having remote access to information and services, anytime and anywhere.",
                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
                "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",
                "It supports group interaction in mobile distributed computing environments in a way that group members need not to at the same place any longer in order to interact with each other or just to be aware of the others situation.",

                "Chapter 2 presents the architecture of GISS, and chapter 3 and 4 discuss the location sensing and group interaction concepts of GISS in more detail.",
                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
                "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
                "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
                "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
                "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a <br>fifth contextdimension group-context</br>, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
                "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
                "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
                "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
                "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3.",
                "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
                "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
                "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
                "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
                "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
                "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
                "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
                "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
                "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
                "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
                "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
                "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
                "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
                "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
                "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
                "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
                "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
                "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
                "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
                "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
                "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
                "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
                "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
                "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
                "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",

                "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",
                "We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand.",

                "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",

                "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
                "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",
                "It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate.",
                "According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand.",
                "The fusion of symbolic locations as well as the fusion of spatial proximities operates on standardized information (cf.",
                "Figure 3).",
                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
                "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
                "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",

                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",

                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",

                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",

                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",

                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",

                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",

                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
                "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
                "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
                "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
                "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3.",
                "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
                "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
                "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
                "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
                "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
                "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
                "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
                "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
                "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
                "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
                "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
                "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
                "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
                "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
                "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
                "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
                "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
                "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
                "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
                "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
                "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
                "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
                "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
                "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
                "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",

                "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",
                "We have implemented two types of proximity-sensors, which are based on Bluetooth on the one hand and on fused symbolic locations (see chapter 3.3.1) on the other hand.",
                "The Bluetooth-implementation goes along with the implementation of the Bluetooth-based location sensor.",
                "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",
                "The second sensor is based on symbolic locations processed by Location Sensor Fusion, wherefore it does not need a client-side implementation.",
                "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
                "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",
                "It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate.",
                "According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand.",
                "The fusion of symbolic locations as well as the fusion of spatial proximities operates on standardized information (cf.",
                "Figure 3).",
                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
                "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
                "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",

                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",

                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
                "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",

                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",

                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",

                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (<br>event-condition-action</br>)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",

                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",

                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",

                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",

                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",

                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",

                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",

                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "New situations appear, where the users context - for example his current location or nearby people - is more dynamic; computation does not occur at a single location and in a single context any longer, but comprises a multitude of situations and locations.",
                "This development leads to a new class of applications, which are aware of the context in which they run in and thus bringing virtual and real worlds together.",
                "Motivated by this and the fact, that only a few studies have been done for supporting group communication in such computing environments [12], we have developed a system, which we refer to as Group Interaction Support System (GISS).",

                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",

                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",

                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",

                "In the contact list, the current symbolic location one level below the previously calculated common location is then displayed.",
                "If, for example, user A currently resides in room P121 at the first floor of a building and user B, which has to be displayed in the contact list of user A, is in room P304 at the third floor, the most accurate common location of these two users is the building they are in.",
                "For that reason, the floor (i.e. one level beyond the common location, namely the building) of user B is displayed in the contact list of user A.",
                "If both people reside on the same floor or even in the same room, the room would be taken.",
                "Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Simple Instant Messenger3 , where the current location of those people, whose location is known by GISS, is displayed in brackets right beside their name.",
                "On top of the image, the heightened, integrated GISS-toolbar is shown, which currently contains the following, implemented functionality (from left to right): Asynchronous communication for groups (see chapter 4.4.4), context-aware reminders (see chapter 4.4.6), two-dimensional visualisation of locationinformation, forming and managing groups (see chapter 4.4.2), context-aware availability-management (see chapter 4.4.5) and finally a button for terminating GISS.",
                "Figure 5.",
                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",
                "Figure 6).",
                "Due to lacks in navigational and usability issues, we decided to use a twodimensional view of the floor (it is referred to as level in the location hierarchy, cf.",
                "Figure 4).",
                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",

                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",

                "Chapter 5 gives a final summary of our work. 1.1 What is Context Computing?",
                "According to Merriam-Websters Online Dictionary1 , context is defined as the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.",
                "Because this definition is very general, many approaches have been made to define the notion of context with respect to computing environments.",
                "Most definitions of context are done by enumerating examples or by choosing synonyms for context.",
                "The term context-aware has been introduced first in [10] where context is referred to as location, identities of nearby people and objects, and changes to those objects.",
                "In [2], context is also defined by an enumeration of examples, namely location, identities of the people around the user, the time of the day, season, temperature etc. [9] defines context as the users location, environment, identity and time.",
                "Here we conform to a widely accepted and more formal definition, which defines context as any information than can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.",
                "An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves. [4] [4] identifies four primary types of context information (sometimes referred to as context dimensions), that are - with respect to characterizing the situation of an entity - more important than others.",
                "These are location, identity, time and activity, which can also be used to derive other sources of contextual information (secondary context types).",
                "For example, if we know a persons identity, we can easily derive related information about this person from several data sources (e.g. day of birth or e-mail address).",
                "According to this definition, [4] defines a system to be contextaware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the users task. [4] also gives a classification of features for context-aware applications, which comprises presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.",
                "Figure 1.",
                "Layers of a context-aware system Context computing is based on two major issues, namely identifying relevant context (identity, location, time, activity) and using obtained context (automatic execution, presentation, tagging).",
                "In order to do this, there are a few layers between (see Figure 1).",
                "First, the obtained low-level context information has to be transformed, aggregated and interpreted (context transformation) and represented in an abstract context world model (context representation), either centralized or decentralized.",
                "Finally, the stored context information is used to trigger certain context events (context triggering). [7] 1.2 Group Interaction in Context After these abstract and formal definitions about what context and context computing is, we will now focus on the main goal of this work, namely how the interaction of mobile group members can be supported by using context information.",
                "In [6] we have identified organizational systems to be crucial for supporting mobile groups (see Figure 2).",
                "First, there has to be an Information and Knowledge Management System, which is capable of supporting a team with its information processing- and knowledge gathering needs.",
                "The next part is the Awareness System, which is dedicated to the perceptualisation of the effects of team activity.",
                "It does this by communicating work context, agenda and workspace information to the users.",
                "The Interaction Systems provide support for the communication among team members, either synchronous or asynchronous, and for the shared access to artefacts, such as documents.",
                "Mobility Systems deploy mechanisms to enable any-place access to team memory as well as the capturing and delivery of awareness information from and to any places.",
                "Finally yet importantly, the organisational innovation system integrates aspects of the team itself, like roles, leadership and shared facilities.",
                "With respect to these five aspects of team support, we focus on interaction and partly cover mobility- and awareness-support.",
                "Group interaction includes all means that enable group members to communicate freely with all the other members.",
                "At this point, the question how context information can be used for supporting group interaction comes up.",
                "We believe that information about the current situation of a person provides a surplus value to existing group interaction systems.",
                "Context information facilitates group interaction by allowing each member to be aware of the availability status or the current location of each other group member, which again makes it possible to form groups dynamically, to place virtual post-its in the real world or to determine which people are around.",
                "Figure 2.",
                "Support for Mobile Groups [6] Most of todays context-aware applications use location and time only, and location is referred to as a crucial type of context information [3].",
                "We also see the importance of location information in mobile and ubiquitous environments, wherefore a main focus of our work is on the utilization of location information and information about users in spatial proximity.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that location, as the only used type of context information, is not sufficient to support group interaction, wherefore we also take advantage of the other three primary types, namely identity, time and activity.",
                "This provides a comprehensive description of a users current situation and thus enabling numerous means for supporting group interaction, which are described in detail in chapter 4.4.",
                "When we look at the types of context information stated above, we can see that all of them are single user-centred, taking into account only the context of the user itself.",
                "We believe, that for the support of group interaction, the status of the group itself has also be taken into account.",
                "Therefore, we have added a fifth contextdimension group-context, which comprises more than the sum of the individual members contexts.",
                "Group context includes any information about the situation of a whole group, for example how many members a group currently has or if a certain group meets right now. 1.3 Context Middleware The Group Interaction Support System (GISS) uses the softwareframework introduced in [1], which serves as a middleware for developing context-sensitive applications.",
                "This so-called Context Framework is based on a distributed communication architecture and it supports different kinds of transport protocols and message coding mechanisms. 89 A main feature of the framework is the abstraction of context information retrieval via various sensors and its delivery to a level where no difference appears, for the application designer, between these different kinds of context retrieval mechanisms; the information retrieval is hidden from the application developer.",
                "This is achieved by so-called entities, which describe objectse.g. a human user - that are important for a certain context scenario.",
                "Entities express their functionality by the use of so-called attributes, which can be loaded into the entity.",
                "These attributes are complex pieces of software, which are implemented as Java classes.",
                "Typical attributes are encapsulations of sensors, but they can also be used to implement context services, for example to notify other entities about location changes of users.",
                "Each entity can contain a collection of such attributes, where an entity itself is an attribute.",
                "The initial set of attributes an entity contains can change dynamically at runtime, if an entity loads or unloads attributes from the local storage or over the network.",
                "In order to load and deploy new attributes, an entity has to reference a class loader and a transport and lookup layer, which manages the lookup mechanism for discovering other entities and the transport.",
                "XML configuration files specify which initial set of entities should be loaded and which attributes these entities own.",
                "The communication between entities and attributes is based on context events.",
                "Each attribute is able to trigger events, which are addressed to other attributes and entities respectively, independently on which physical computer they are running.",
                "Among other things, and event contains the name of the event and a list of parameters delivering information about the event itself.",
                "Related with this event-based architecture is the use of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)-rules for defining the behaviour of the context system.",
                "Therefore, every entity has a rule-interpreter, which catches triggered events, checks conditions associated with them and causes certain actions.",
                "These rules are referenced by the entitys XML configuration.",
                "A rule itself is even able to trigger the insertion of new rules or the unloading of existing rules at runtime in order to change the behaviour of the context system dynamically.",
                "To sum up, the context framework provides a flexible, distributed architecture for hiding low-level sensor data from high-level applications and it hides external communication details from the application developer.",
                "Furthermore, it is able to adapt its behaviour dynamically by loading attributes, entities or ECArules at runtime. 2.",
                "ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW As GISS uses the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3 as middleware, every user is represented by an entity, as well as the central server, which is responsible for context transformation, context representation and context triggering (cf.",
                "Figure 1).",
                "A main part of our work is about the automated acquisition of position information and its sensor-independent provision at application level.",
                "We do not only sense the current location of users, but also determine spatial proximities between them.",
                "Developing the architecture, we focused on keeping the client as simple as possible and reducing the communication between client and server to a minimum.",
                "Each client may have various location and/or proximity sensors attached, which are encapsulated by respective Context Framework-attributes (Sensor Encapsulation).",
                "These attributes are responsible for integrating native sensor-implementations into the Context Framework and sending sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "We consider it very important to support different types of sensors even at the same time, in order to improve location accuracy on the one hand, while providing a pervasive location-sensing environment with seamless transition between different location sensing techniques on the other hand.",
                "All location- and proximity-sensors supported are represented by server-side context-attributes, which correspond to the client-side sensor encapsulation-attributes and abstract the sensor-dependent position information received from all users via the wireless network (sensor abstraction).",
                "This requires a context repository, where the mapping of diverse physical positions to standardized locations is stored.",
                "The standardized location- and proximity-information of each user is then passed to the so-called Sensor Fusion-attributes, one for symbolic locations and a second one for spatial proximities.",
                "Their job is to merge location- and proximityinformation of clients, respectively, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.3.",
                "Every time the symbolic location of a user or the spatial proximity between two users changes, the Sensor Fusion-attributes notify the GISS Core-attribute, which controls the application.",
                "Because of the abstraction of sensor-dependent position information, the system can easily be extended by additional sensors, just by implementing the (typically two) attributes for encapsulating sensors (some sensors may not need a client-side part), abstracting physical positions and observing the interface to GISS Core.",
                "Figure 3.",
                "Architecture of the Group Interaction Support System (GISS) The GISS Core-attribute is the central coordinator of the application as it shows to the user.",
                "It not only serves as an interface to the location-sensing subsystem, but also collects further context information in other dimensions (time, identity or activity). 90 Every time a change in the context of one or more users is detected, GISS Core evaluates the effect of these changes on the user, on the groups he belongs to and on the other members of these groups.",
                "Whenever necessary, events are thrown to the affected clients to trigger context-aware activities, like changing the presentation of awareness information or the execution of services.",
                "The client-side part of the application is kept as simple as possible.",
                "Furthermore, modular design was not only an issue on the sensor side but also when designing the user interface architecture.",
                "Thus, the complete user interface can be easily exchanged, if all of the defined events are taken into account and understood by the new interface-attribute.",
                "The currently implemented user interface is split up in two parts, which are also represented by two attributes.",
                "The central attribute on client-side is the so-called Instant Messenger Encapsulation, which on the one hand interacts with the server through events and on the other hand serves as a proxy for the external application the user interface is built on.",
                "As external application, we use an existing open source instant messenger - the ICQ2 -compliant Simple Instant Messenger (SIM)3 .",
                "We have chosen and instant messenger as front-end because it provides a well-known interface for most users and facilitates a seamless integration of group interaction support, thus increasing acceptance and ease of use.",
                "As the basic functionality of the instant messenger - to serve as a client in an instant messenger network - remains fully functional, our application is able to use the features already provided by the messenger.",
                "For example, the contexts activity and identity are derived from the messenger network as it is described later.",
                "The Instant Messenger Encapsulation is also responsible for supporting group communication.",
                "Through the interface of the messenger, it provides means of synchronous and asynchronous communication as well as a context-aware reminder system and tools for managing groups and the own availability status.",
                "The second part of the user interface is a visualisation of the users locations, which is implemented in the attribute Viewer.",
                "The current implementation provides a two-dimensional map of the campus, but it can easily be replaced by other visualisations, a three-dimensional VRML-model for example.",
                "Furthermore, this visualisation is used to show the artefacts for asynchronous communication.",
                "Based on a floor plan-view of the geographical area the user currently resides in, it gives a quick overview of which people are nearby, their state and provides means to interact with them.",
                "In the following chapters 3 and 4, we describe the location sensing-backend and the application front-end for supporting group interaction in more detail. 3.",
                "LOCATION SENSING In the following chapter, we will introduce a location model, which is used for representing locations; afterwards, we will describe the integration of location- and proximity-sensors in 2 http://www.icq.com/ 3 http://sim-icq.sourceforge.net more detail.",
                "Finally, we will have a closer look on the fusion of location- and proximity-information, acquired by various sensors. 3.1 Location Model A location model (i.e. a context representation for the contextinformation location) is needed to represent the locations of users, in order to be able to facilitate location-related queries like given a location, return a list of all the objects there or given an object, return its current location.",
                "In general, there are two approaches [3,5]: symbolic models, which represent location as abstract symbols, and a geometric model, which represent location as coordinates.",
                "We have chosen a symbolic location model, which refers to locations as abstract symbols like Room P111 or Physics Building, because we do not require geometric location data.",
                "Instead, abstract symbols are more convenient for human interaction at application level.",
                "Furthermore, we use a symbolic location containment hierarchy similar to the one introduced in [11], which consists of top-level regions, which contain buildings, which contain floors, and the floors again contain rooms.",
                "We also distinguish four types, namely region (e.g. a whole campus), section (e.g. a building or an outdoor section), level (e.g. a certain floor in a building) and area (e.g. a certain room).",
                "We introduce a fifth type of location, which we refer to as semantic.",
                "These socalled semantic locations can appear at any level in the hierarchy and they can be nested, but they do not necessarily have a geographic representation.",
                "Examples for such semantic locations are tagged objects within a room (e.g. a desk and a printer on this desk) or the name of a department, which contains certain rooms.",
                "Figure 4.",
                "Symbolic Location Containment Hierarchy The hierarchy of symbolic locations as well as the type of each position is stored in the context repository. 3.2 Sensors Our architecture supports two different kinds of sensors: location sensors, which acquire location information, and proximity sensors, which detect spatial proximities between users.",
                "As described above, each sensor has a server- and in most cases a corresponding client-side-implementation, too.",
                "While the clientattributes (Sensor Abstraction) are responsible for acquiring low-level sensor-data and transmitting it to the server, the corresponding Sensor Encapsulation-attributes transform them into a uniform and sensor-independent format, namely symbolic locations and IDs of users in spatial proximity, respectively. 91 Afterwards, the respective attribute Sensor Fusion is being triggered with this sensor-independent information of a certain user, detected by a particular sensor.",
                "Such notifications are performed every time the sensor acquired new information.",
                "Accordingly, Sensor Abstraction-attributes are responsible to detect when a certain sensor is no longer available on the client side (e.g. if it has been unplugged by the user) or when position respectively proximity could not be determined any longer (e.g.",
                "RFID reader cannot detect tags) and notify the corresponding sensor fusion about this. 3.2.1 Location Sensors In order to sense physical positions, the Sensor Encapsulationattributes asynchronously transmit sensor-dependent position information to the server.",
                "The corresponding location Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect these physical positions delivered by the sensors of all users, and perform a repository-lookup in order to get the associated symbolic location.",
                "This requires certain tables for each sensor, which map physical positions to symbolic locations.",
                "One physical position may have multiple symbolic locations at different accuracy-levels in the location hierarchy assigned to, for example if a sensor covers several rooms.",
                "If such a mapping could be found, an event is thrown in order to notify the attribute Location Sensor Fusion about the symbolic locations a certain sensor of a particular user determined.",
                "We have prototypically implemented three kinds of location sensors, which are based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification).",
                "We have chosen these three completely different sensors because of their differences concerning accuracy, coverage and administrative effort, in order to evaluate the flexibility of our system (see Table 1).",
                "The most accurate one is an RFID sensor, which is based on an active RFID-reader.",
                "As soon as the reader is plugged into the client, it scans for active RFID tags in range and transmits their serial numbers to the server, where they are mapped to symbolic locations.",
                "We also take into account RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Information), which provides position accuracy of few centimetres and thus enables us to determine which RFID-tag is nearest.",
                "Due to this high accuracy, RFID is used for locating users within rooms.",
                "The administration is quite simple; once a new RFID tag is placed, its serial number simply has to be assigned to a single symbolic location.",
                "A drawback is the poor availability, which can be traced back to the fact that RFID readers are still very expensive.",
                "The second one is an 802.11 WLAN sensor.",
                "Therefore, we integrated a purely software-based, commercial WLAN positioning system for tracking clients on the university campuswide WLAN infrastructure.",
                "The reached position accuracy is in the range of few meters and thus is suitable for location sensing at the granularity of rooms.",
                "A big disadvantage is that a map of the whole area has to be calibrated with measuring points at a distance of 5 meters each.",
                "Because most mobile computers are equipped with WLAN technology and the positioning-system is a software-only solution, nearly everyone is able to use this kind of sensor.",
                "Finally, we have implemented a Bluetooth sensor, which detects Bluetooth tags (i.e.",
                "Bluetooth-modules with known position) in range and transmits them to the server that maps to symbolic locations.",
                "Because of the fact that we do not use signal strengthinformation in the current implementation, the accuracy is above 10 meters and therefore a single Bluetooth MAC address is associated with several symbolic locations, according to the physical locations such a Bluetooth module covers.",
                "This leads to the disadvantage that the range of each Bluetooth-tag has to be determined and mapped to symbolic locations within this range.",

                "Similar to the location sensors, the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes collect physical proximity information of all users and transform them to mappings of user-IDs.",

                "The already determined Bluetooth MAC addresses in range of a certain client are being compared with those of all other clients, and each time the attribute Bluetooth Sensor Abstraction detects congruence, it notifies the proximity sensor fusion about this.",

                "Each time the fused symbolic location of a certain user changes, it checks whether he is at the same symbolic location like another user and again notifies the proximity sensor fusion about the proximity between these two users.",
                "The range can be restricted to any level of the location containment hierarchy, for example to room granularity.",
                "A currently unresolved issue is the incomparable granularity of different proximity sensors.",
                "For example, the symbolic locations at same level in the location hierarchy mostly do not cover the same geographic area. 3.3 Sensor Fusion Core of the location sensing subsystem is the sensor fusion.",
                "It merges data of various sensors, while coping with differences concerning accuracy, coverage and sample-rate.",
                "According to the two kinds of sensors described in chapter 3.2, we distinguish between fusion of location sensors on the one hand, and fusion of proximity sensors on the other hand.",

                "Figure 3).",
                "This has the advantage, that additional position- and proximitysensors can be added easily or the fusion algorithms can be replaced by ones that are more sophisticated. 92 Fusion is performed for each user separately and takes into account the measurements at a single point in time only (i.e. no history information is used for determining the current location of a certain user).",
                "The algorithm collects all events thrown by the Sensor Abstraction-attributes, performs fusion and triggers the GISS Core-attribute if the symbolic location of a certain user or the spatial proximity between users changed.",
                "An important feature is the persistent storage of location- and proximity-history in a database in order to allow future retrieval.",
                "This enables applications to visualize the movement of users for example. 3.3.1 Location Sensor Fusion Goal of the fusion of location information is to improve precision and accuracy by merging the set of symbolic locations supplied by various location sensors, in order to reduce the number of these locations to a minimum, ideally to a single symbolic location per user.",
                "This is quite difficult, because different sensors may differ in accuracy and sample rate as well.",
                "The Location Sensor Fusion-attribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Location Sensor Abstractionattributes.",
                "These events contain information about the identity of the user concerned, his current location and the sensor by which the location has been determined.",
                "If the attribute Location Sensor Fusion receives such an event, it checks if the amount of symbolic locations of the user concerned has changed (compared with the last event).",
                "If this is the case, it notifies the GISS Core-attribute about all symbolic locations this user is currently associated with.",
                "However, this information is not very useful on its own if a certain user is associated with several locations.",
                "As described in chapter 3.2.1, a single location sensor may deliver multiple symbolic locations.",
                "Moreover, a certain user may have several location sensors, which supply symbolic locations differing in accuracy (i.e. different levels in the location containment hierarchy).",
                "To cope with this challenge, we implemented a fusion algorithm in order to reduce the number of symbolic locations to a minimum (ideally to a single location).",
                "In a first step, each symbolic location is associated with its number of occurrences.",
                "A symbolic location may occur several times if it is referred to by more than one sensor or if a single sensor detects multiple tags, which again refer to several locations.",
                "Furthermore, this number is added to the previously calculated number of occurrences of each symbolic location, which is a child-location of the considered one in the location containment hierarchy.",
                "For example, if - in Figure 4 - room2 occurs two times and desk occurs a single time, the value 2 of room2 is added to the value 1 of desk, whereby desk finally gets the value 3.",
                "In a final step, only those symbolic locations are left which are assigned with the highest number of occurrences.",
                "A further reduction can be achieved by assigning priorities to sensors (based on accuracy and confidence) and cumulating these priorities for each symbolic location instead of just counting the number of occurrences.",
                "If the remaining fused locations have changed (i.e. if they differ from the fused locations the considered user is currently associated with), they are provided with the current timestamp, written to the database and the GISS-attribute is notified about where the user is probably located.",
                "Finally, the most accurate, common location in the location hierarchy is calculated (i.e. the least upper bound of these symbolic locations) in order to get a single symbolic location.",
                "If it changes, the GISS Core-attribute is triggered again. 3.3.2 Proximity Sensor Fusion Proximity sensor fusion is much simpler than the fusion of symbolic locations.",
                "The corresponding proximity sensor fusionattribute is triggered by events, which are thrown by the Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attributes.",
                "These special events contain information about the identity of the two users concerned, if they are currently in spatial proximity or if proximity no longer persists, and by which proximity-sensor this has been detected.",
                "If the sensor fusion-attribute is notified by a certain Proximity Sensor Abstraction-attribute about an existing spatial proximity, it first checks if these two users are already known to be in proximity (detected either by another user or by another proximity-sensor of the user, which caused the event).",
                "If not, this change in proximity is written to the context repository with current timestamp.",
                "Similarly, if the attribute Proximity Fusion is notified about an ended proximity, it checks if the users are still known to be in proximity, and writes this change to the repository if not.",
                "Finally, if spatial proximity between the two users actually changed, an event is thrown to notify the GISS Core-attribute about this. 4.",

                "In our approach, we use context information to enhance interaction and provide further services, which offer new possibilities to the user.",
                "Furthermore, we believe that interaction in groups also has to take into account the current context of the group itself and not only the context of individual group members.",
                "For this reason, we also retrieve information about the groups current context, derived from the contexts of the group members together with some sort of meta-information (see chapter 4.3).",

                "The chosen solution is based on an existing instant messenger, which offers several possibilities to integrate our system (see chapter 4.2).",
                "The biggest advantage of this approach is that the user is confronted with a graphical user interface he is already used to in most cases.",

                "The 4 http://sourceforge.net/ 5 http://www.aim.com/ 6 http://messenger.msn.com/ functionality of the plug-in was extended in several ways, for example to accept messages for an account (as if they would have been sent via the messenger network).",
                "The messenger, more exactly the contact list (i.e. a list of profiles of all people registered with the instant messenger, which is visualized by listing their names as it can be seen in Figure 5), is also used to display locations of other members of the groups a user belongs to.",

                "A more comprehensive description of these features is given in chapter 4.4. 4.3 Sources of Context Information While the location-context of a user is obtained from our location sensing subsystem described in chapter 3, we consider further types of context than location relevant for the support of group interaction, too.",
                "Local time as a very important context dimension can be easily retrieved from the real time clock of the users system.",

                "Other activities like making a phone call or something similar, cannot be recognized with the current implementation of the activity sensor.",
                "The only context-information used is the instant messengers availability state, thus only providing a very coarse classification of the users activity (online, offline, away, busy etc.).",
                "Although this may not seem to be very much information, it is surely relevant and can be used to improve or even enable several services.",
                "Having collected the context information from all available users, it is now possible to distil some information about the context of a certain group.",
                "Information about the context of a group includes how many members the group currently has, if the group meets right now, which members are participating at a meeting, how many members have read which of the available posts from other team members and so on.",
                "Therefore, some additional information like a list of members for each group is needed.",
                "These lists can be assembled manually (by users joining and leaving groups) or retrieved automatically.",
                "The context of a group is secondary context and is aggregated from the available contexts of the group members.",
                "Every time the context of a single group member changes, the context of the whole group is changing and has to be recalculated.",
                "With knowledge about a users context and the context of the groups he belongs to, we can provide several context-aware services to the user, which enhance his interaction abilities.",
                "A brief description of these services is given in chapter 4.4. 94 4.4 Group Interaction Support 4.4.1 Visualisation of Location Information An important feature is the visualisation of location information, thus allowing users to be aware of the location of other users and members of groups he joined, respectively.",
                "As already described in chapter 2, we use two different forms of visualisation.",
                "The maybe more important one is to display location information in the contact list of the instant messenger, right beside the name, thus being always visible while not drawing the users attention on it (compared with a twodimensional view for example, which requires a own window for displaying a map of the environment).",
                "Due to the restricted space in the contact list, it has been necessary to implement some sort of level-of-detail concept.",

                "GISS integration in Simple Instant Messenger3 As displaying just this short form of location may not be enough for the user, because he may want to see the most accurate position available, a fully qualified position is shown if a name in the contact-list is clicked (e.g. in the form of desk@room2@department1@1stfloor@building 1@campus).",
                "The second possible form of visualisation is a graphical one.",
                "We have evaluated a three-dimensional view, which was based on a VRML model of the respective area (cf.",

                "Other levels of granularity like section (e.g. building) and region (e.g. campus) are also provided.",
                "In this floor-plan-based view, the current locations are shown in the manner of ICQ2 contacts, which are placed at the currently sensed location of the respective person.",
                "The availability-status of a user, for example away if he is not on the computer right now, or busy if he does not want to be disturbed, is visualized by colour-coding the ICQ2 -flower left beside the name.",
                "Furthermore, the floor-plan-view shows so-called the virtual post-its, which are virtual counterparts of real-life post-its and serve as our means of asynchronous communication (more about virtual post-its can be found in chapter 4.4.4).",
                "Figure 6. 3D-view of the floor (VRML) Figure 7 shows the two-dimensional map of a certain floor, where several users are currently located (visualized by their name and the flower left beside).",
                "The location of the client, on which the map is displayed, is visualized by a green circle.",
                "Down to the right, two virtual post-its can be seen.",
                "Figure 7. 2D view of the floor Another feature of the 2D-view is the visualisation of locationhistory of users.",
                "As we store the complete history of a users locations together with a timestamp, we are able to provide information about the locations he has been back in time.",
                "When the mouse is moved over the name of a certain user in the 2Dview, footprints of a user, placed at the locations he has been, are faded out the stronger, the older the location information is. 95 4.4.2 Forming and Managing Groups To support interaction in groups, it is first necessary to form groups.",
                "As groups can have different purposes, we distinguish two types of groups.",
                "So-called static groups are groups, which are built up manually by people joining and leaving them.",
                "Static groups can be further divided into two subtypes.",
                "In open static groups, everybody can join and leave anytime, useful for example to form a group of lecture attendees of some sort of interest group.",
                "Closed static groups have an owner, who decides, which persons are allowed to join, although everybody could leave again at any time.",
                "Closed groups enable users for example to create a group of their friends, thus being able to communicate with them easily.",
                "In contrast to that, we also support the creation of dynamic groups.",
                "They are formed among persons, who are at the same location at the same time.",
                "The creation of dynamic groups is only performed at locations, where it makes sense to form groups, for example in lecture halls or meeting rooms, but not on corridors or outdoor.",
                "It would also be not very meaningful to form a group only of the people residing in the left front sector of a hall; instead, the complete hall should be considered.",
                "For these reasons, all the defined locations in the hierarchy are tagged, whether they allow the formation of groups or not.",
                "Dynamic groups are also not only formed granularity of rooms, but also on higher levels in the hierarchy, for example with the people currently residing in the area of a department.",
                "As the members of dynamic groups constantly change, it is possible to create an open static group out of them. 4.4.3 Synchronous Communication for Groups The most important form of synchronous communication on computers today is instant messaging; some people even see instant messaging to be the real killer application on the Internet.",
                "This has also motivated the decision to build GISS upon an instant messaging system.",
                "In todays messenger systems, peer-to-peer-communication is extensively supported.",
                "However, when it comes to communication in groups, the support is rather poor most of the time.",
                "Often, only sending a message to multiple recipients is supported, lacking means to take into account the current state of the recipients.",
                "Furthermore, groups can only be formed of members in ones contact list, thus being not able to send messages to a group, where not all of its members are known (which may be the case in settings, where the participants of a lecture form a group).",
                "Our approach does not have the mentioned restrictions.",
                "We introduce group-entries in the users contact list; enable him or his to send messages to this group easily, without knowing who exactly is currently a member of this group.",
                "Furthermore, group messages are only delivered to persons, who are currently not busy, thus preventing a disturbance by a message, which is possibly unimportant for the user.",
                "These features cannot be carried out in the messenger network itself, so whenever a message to a group account is sent, we intercept it and route it through our system to all the recipients, which are available at a certain time.",
                "Communication via a group account is also stored centrally, enabling people to query missed messages or simply viewing the message history. 4.4.4 Asynchronous Communication for Groups Asynchronous communication in groups is not a new idea.",
                "The goal of this approach is not to reinvent the wheel, as email is maybe the most widely used form of asynchronous communication on computers and is broadly accepted and standardized.",
                "In out work, we aim at the combination of asynchronous communication with location awareness.",
                "For this reason, we introduce the concept of so-called virtual postits (cp. [13]), which are messages that are bound to physical locations.",
                "These virtual post-its could be either visible for all users that are passing by or they can be restricted to be visible for certain groups of people only.",
                "Moreover, a virtual post-it can also have an expiry date after which it is dropped and not displayed anymore.",
                "Virtual post-its can also be commented by others, thus providing some from of forum-like interaction, where each post-it forms a thread.",
                "Virtual post-its are displayed automatically, whenever a user (available) passes by the first time.",
                "Afterwards, post-its can be accessed via the 2D-viewer, where all visible post-its are shown.",
                "All readers of a post-it are logged and displayed when viewing it, providing some sort of awareness about the group members activities in the past. 4.4.5 Context-aware Availability Management Instant messengers in general provide some kind of availability information about a user.",
                "Although this information can be only defined in a very coarse granularity, we have decided to use these means of gathering activity context, because the introduction of an additional one would strongly decrease the usability of the system.",
                "To support the user managing his availability, we provide an interface that lets the user define rules to adapt his availability to the current context.",
                "These rules follow the form on event (E) if condition (C) then action (A), which is directly supported by the ECA-rules of the Context Framework described in chapter 1.3.",
                "The testing of conditions is periodically triggered by throwing events (whenever the context of a user changes).",
                "The condition itself is defined by the user, who can demand the change of his availability status as the action in the rule.",
                "As a condition, the user can define his location, a certain time (also triggering daily, every week or every month) or any logical combination of these criteria. 4.4.6 Context-Aware Reminders Reminders [14] are used to give the user the opportunity of defining tasks and being reminded of those, when certain criteria are fulfilled.",
                "Thus, a reminder can be seen as a post-it to oneself, which is only visible in certain cases.",
                "Reminders can be bound to a certain place or time, but also to spatial proximity of users or groups.",
                "These criteria can be combined with Boolean operators, thus providing a powerful means to remind the user of tasks that he wants to carry out when a certain context occurs.",
                "A reminder will only pop up the first time the actual context meets the defined criterion.",
                "On showing up the reminder, the user has the chance to resubmit it to be reminded again, for example five minutes later or the next time a certain user is in spatial proximity. 96 4.4.7 Context-Aware Recognition and Notification of Group Meetings With the available context information, we try to recognize meetings of a group.",
                "The determination of the criteria, when the system recognizes a group having a meeting, is part of the ongoing work.",
                "In a first approach, we use the location- and activity-context of the group members to determine a meeting.",
                "Whenever more than 50 % of the members of a group are available at a location, where a meeting is considered to make sense (e.g. not on a corridor), a meeting minutes post-it is created at this location and all absent group members are notified of the meeting and the location it takes place.",
                "During the meeting, the comment-feature of virtual post-its provides a means to take notes for all of the participants.",
                "When members are joining or leaving the meeting, this is automatically added as a note to the list of comments.",
                "Like the recognition of the beginning of a meeting, the recognition of its end is still part of ongoing work.",
                "If the end of the meeting is recognized, all group members get the complete list of comments as a meeting protocol at the end of the meeting. 5.",
                "CONCLUSIONS This paper discussed the potentials of support for group interaction by using context information.",
                "First, we introduced the notions of context and context computing and motivated their value for supporting group interaction.",
                "An architecture is presented to support context-aware group interaction in mobile, distributed environments.",
                "It is built upon a flexible and extensible framework, thus enabling an easy adoption to available context sources (e.g. by adding additional sensors) as well as the required form of representation.",
                "We have prototypically developed a set of services, which enhance group interaction by taking into account the current context of the users as well as the context of groups itself.",
                "Important features are dynamic formation of groups, visualization of location on a two-dimensional map as well as unobtrusively integrated in an instant-messenger, asynchronous communication by virtual post-its, which are bound to certain locations, and a context-aware availability-management, which adapts the availability-status of a user to his current situation.",
                "To provide location information, we have implemented a subsystem for automated acquisition of location- and proximityinformation provided by various sensors, which provides a technology-independent presentation of locations and spatial proximities between users and merges this information using sensor-independent fusion algorithms.",
                "A history of locations as well as of spatial proximities is stored in a database, thus enabling context history-based services. 6.",
