However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents payments will sum to more than 0. If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer. However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents. In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property. In this paper, we extend this result in a restricted setting. We study allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].) Here we propose a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents. All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategyproof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit. The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case. We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program. We give both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). Finally, we prove that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.

INTRODUCTION Many important problems in computer science and electronic commerce can be modeled as resource allocation problems. In such problems, we want to allocate the resources (or items) to the agents that value them the most. Unfortunately, agents valuations are private knowledge, and self-interested agents will lie about their valuations if this is to their benefit. One solution is to auction off the items, possibly in a combinatorial auction where agents can bid on bundles of items. There exist ways of determining the payments that the agents make in such an auction that incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof. One very general way of doing so is to use the VCG mechanism [23, 4, 12]. (The VCG mechanism is also known as the Clarke mechanism or, in the specific context of auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction.) Besides strategy-proofness, the VCG mechanism has several other nice properties in the context of resource allocation problems. It is efficient: the chosen allocation always maximizes the sum of the agents valuations. It is also (expost) individually rational: participating in the mechanism never makes an agent worse off than not participating. Finally, it has a no-deficit property: the sum of the agents payments is always nonnegative. In many settings, another property that would be desirable is (strong) budget balance, meaning that the payments sum to exactly 0. Suppose the agents are trying to distribute some resources among themselves that do not have a previous owner. For example, the agents may be trying to allocate the right to use a shared good on a given day. Or, the agents may be trying to allocate a resource that they have collectively constructed, discovered, or otherwise obtained. If the agents use an auction to allocate these resources, and the sum of the agents payments in the auction is positive, then this surplus payment must leave the system 30 of the agents (for example, the agents must give the money to an outside party, or burn it). Na¨ıve redistribution of the surplus payment (e.g. each of the n agents receives 1/n of the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not strategy-proof (e.g. in a Vickrey auction, the second-highest bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger redistribution payment). Unfortunately, the VCG mechanism is not budget balanced: typically, there is surplus payment. Unfortunately, in general settings, it is in fact impossible to design mechanisms that satisfy budget balance in addition to the other desirable properties [16, 11, 21]. In light of this impossibility result, several authors have obtained budget balance by sacrificing some of the other desirable properties [2, 6, 22, 5]. Another approach that is perhaps preferable is to use a mechanism that is more budget balanced than the VCG mechanism, and maintains all the other desirable properties. One way of trying to design such a mechanism is to redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents in a way that will not affect the agents incentives (so that strategy-proofness is maintained), and that will maintain the other properties. In 2006, Cavallo [3] pursued exactly this idea, and designed a mechanism that redistributes a large amount of the total VCG payment while maintaining all of the other desirable properties of the VCG mechanism. For example, in a single-item auction (where the VCG mechanism coincides with the second-price sealed-bid auction), the amount redistributed to bidder i by Cavallos mechanism is 1/n times the second-highest bid among bids other than is bid. The total redistributed is at most the second-highest bid overall, and the redistribution to agent i does not affect is incentives because it does not depend on is own bid. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a limited setting, and in this setting we extend Cavallos result. We study allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and all agents have unit demand, i.e. they want only a single unit. For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2]. Here we propose the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms. All mechanisms in this family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit. The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case (with the caveat that we only study allocation settings with multiple indistinguishable units of a single good and unit demand, while Baileys and Cavallos mechanisms can be applied outside these settings as well). We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism inside the family, based on worst-case analysis. Both numerical and analytical solutions of this model are provided, and the resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the BaileyCavallo mechanism (in the worst case). For example, for the problem of allocating a single unit, when the number of agents is 10, our mechanism always redistributes more than 98% of the total VCG payment back to the agents (whereas the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism redistributes only 80% in the worst case). Finally, we prove that our mechanism is in fact optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms (even nonlinear ones) that satisfy the desirable properties. Around the same time, the same mechanism has been independently derived by Moulin [19].1 Moulin actually pursues a different objective (also based on worst-case analysis): whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of VCG payments that are redistributed, Moulin tries to minimize the overall payments from agents as a percentage of efficiency. It turns out that the resulting mechanisms are the same. Towards the end of this paper, we consider dropping the individual rationality requirement, and show that this does not change the optimal mechanism for our objective. For Moulins objective, dropping individual rationality does change the optimal mechanism (but only if there are multiple units). 2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Let n denote the number of agents, and let m denote the number of units. We only consider the case where m < n (otherwise the problem becomes trivial). We also assume that m and n are always known. (This assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.) Let the set of agents be {a1, a2, . . . , an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. Let vi denote the true value of ai. Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi. Under the VCG mechanism, each agent among a1, . . . , am wins a unit, and pays ˆvm+1 for this unit. Thus, the total VCG payment equals mˆvm+1. When m = 1, this is the second-price or Vickrey auction. We modify the mechanism as follows. After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ais redistribution payment. We do not allow zi to depend on ˆvi; because of this, ais incentives are unaffected by this redistribution payment, and the mechanism remains strategy-proof. 3. LINEAR VCG REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS We are now ready to introduce the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a vector of constants c0, c1, . . . , cn−1. The amount that the mechanism returns to agent ai is zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. That is, an agent receives c0, plus c1 times the highest bid other than the agents own bid, plus c2 times the second-highest other bid, etc. The mechanism is strategy-proof, because for all i, zi is independent of ˆvi. Also, the mechanism is anonymous. It is helpful to see the entire list of redistribution payments: z1 = c0 + c1ˆv2 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z3 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv4 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn z4 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn . . . zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn . . . zn−2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−1 + cn−1ˆvn zn−1 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn−1 1 We thank Rakesh Vohra for pointing us to Moulins working paper. 31 Not all choices of the constants c0, . . . , cn−1 produce a mechanism that is individually rational, and not all choices of the constants produce a mechanism that never incurs a deficit. Hence, to obtain these properties, we need to place some constraints on the constants. To satisfy the individual rationality criterion, each agents utility should always be non-negative. An agent that does not win a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agents redistribution payment. An agent that wins a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agents valuation for the unit, minus the VCG payment ˆvm+1, plus the agents redistribution payment. Consider agent an, the agent with the lowest bid. Since this agent does not win an item (m < n), her utility is just her redistribution payment zn. Hence, for the mechanism to be individually rational, the ci must be such that zn is always nonnegative. If the ci have this property, then it actually follows that zi is nonnegative for every i, for the following reason. Suppose there exists some i < n and some vector of bids ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 such that zi < 0. Then, consider the bid vector that results from replacing ˆvj by ˆvj+1 for all j ≥ i, and letting ˆvn = 0. If we omit ˆvn from this vector, the same vector results that results from omitting ˆvi from the original vector. Therefore, ans redistribution payment under the new vector should be the same as ais redistribution payment under the old vector-but this payment is negative. If all redistribution payments are always nonnegative, then the mechanism must be individually rational (because the VCG mechanism is individually rational, and the redistribution payment only increases an agents utility). Therefore, the mechanism is individually rational if and only if for any bid vector, zn ≥ 0. To satisfy the non-deficit criterion, the sum of the redistribution payments should be less than or equal to the total VCG payment. So for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0, the constants ci should make z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1. We define the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints (so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and have the no-deficit property). We now give two examples of mechanisms in this family. Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i. Under this mechanism, each agent receives a redistribution payment of m n times the (m+1)th highest bid from another agent. Hence, a1, . . . , am+1 receive a redistribution payment of m n ˆvm+2, and the others receive m n ˆvm+1. Thus, the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m− 1)m n ˆvm+1. This redistribution mechanism is individually rational, because all the redistribution payments are nonnegative, and never incurs a deficit, because (m + 1) m n ˆvm+2 + (n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1 ≤ nm n ˆvm+1 = mˆvm+1. (We note that for this mechanism to make sense, we need n ≥ m + 2.) Example 2: Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n−m−1 , cm+2 = − m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) , and ci = 0 for all other i. In this mechanism, each agent receives a redistribution payment of m n−m−1 times the (m + 1)th highest reported value from other agents, minus m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) times the (m+2)th highest reported value from other agents. Thus, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3. If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational. Also, the mechanism never incurs a deficit, because the total VCG payment is mˆvm+1, which is greater than the amount mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3 that is redistributed. Which of these two mechanisms is better? Is there another mechanism that is even better? This is what we study in the next section. 4. OPTIMAL REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS Among all linear VCG redistribution mechanisms, we would like to be able to identify the one that redistributes the greatest percentage of the total VCG payment.2 This is not a well-defined notion: it may be that one mechanism redistributes more on some bid vectors, and another more on other bid vectors. We emphasize that we do not assume that a prior distribution over bidders valuations is available, so we cannot compare them based on expected redistribution. Below, we study three well-defined ways of comparing redistribution mechanisms: best-case performance, dominance, and worst-case performance. Best-case performance. One way of evaluating a mechanism is by considering the highest redistribution percentage that it achieves. Consider the previous two examples. For the first example, the total redistribution payment is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1. When ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1, this is equal to the total VCG payment mˆvm+1. Thus, this mechanism redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case. For the second example, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3. When ˆvm+3 = 0, this is equal to the total VCG payment mˆvm+1. Thus, this mechanism also redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case. Moreover, there are actually infinitely many mechanisms that redistribute 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case-for example, any convex combination of the above two will redistribute 100% if both ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 and ˆvm+3 = 0. Dominance. Inside the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms, we say one mechanism dominates another mechanism if the first one redistributes at least as much as the other for any bid vector. For the previous two examples, neither dominates the other, because they each redistribute 100% in different cases. It turns out that there is no mechanism in the family that dominates all other mechanisms in the family. For suppose such a mechanism exists. Then, it should dominate both examples above. Consider the remaining VCG payment (the VCG payment failed to be redistributed). The remaining VCG payment of the dominant mechanism should be 0 whenever ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 or ˆvm+3 = 0. Now, the remaining VCG payment is a linear function of the ˆvi (linear redistribution), and therefore also a polynomial function. The above implies that this function can be written as (ˆvm+2 − ˆvm+1)(ˆvm+3)P(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn), where P is a 2 The percentage redistributed seems the natural criterion to use, among other things because it is scale-invariant: if we multiply all bids by the same positive constant (for example, if we change the units by re-expressing the bids in euros instead of dollars), we would not want the behavior of our mechanism to change. 32 polynomial function. But since the function must be linear (has degree at most 1), it follows that P = 0. Thus, a dominant mechanism would always redistribute all of the VCG payment, which is not possible. (If it were possible, then our worst-case optimal redistribution mechanism would also always redistribute all of the VCG payment, and we will see later that it does not.) Worst-case performance. Finally, we can evaluate a mechanism by considering the lowest redistribution percentage that it guarantees. For the first example, the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1, which is greater than or equal to (n−m−1) m n ˆvm+1. So in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+2 = 0, the percentage redistributed is n−m−1 n . For the second example, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3, which is greater than or equal to mˆvm+1(1− (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ). So in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+3 = ˆvm+1, the percentage redistributed is 1 − (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) . Since we assume that the number of agents n and the number of units m are known, we can determine which example mechanism has better worst-case performance by comparing the two quantities. When n = 6 and m = 1, for the first example (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism), the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 2 3 , and for the second example, this percentage is 1 2 , which implies that for this pair of n and m, the first mechanism has better worst-case performance. On the other hand, when n = 12 and m = 1, for the first example, the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 5 6 , and for the second example, this percentage is 14 15 , which implies that this time the second mechanism has better worst-case performance. Thus, it seems most natural to compare mechanisms by the percentage of total VCG payment that they redistribute in the worst case. This percentage is undefined when the total VCG payment is 0. To deal with this, technically, we define the worst-case redistribution percentage as the largest k so that the total amount redistributed is at least k times the total VCG payment, for all bid vectors. (Hence, as long as the total amount redistributed is at least 0 when the total VCG payment is 0, these cases do not affect the worst-case percentage.) This corresponds to the following optimization problem: Maximize k (the percentage redistributed in the worst case) Subject to: For every bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 zn ≥ 0 (individual rationality) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 (non-deficit) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≥ kmˆvm+1 (worst-case constraint) We recall that zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. 5. TRANSFORMATION TO LINEAR PROGRAMMING The optimization problem given in the previous section can be rewritten as a linear program, based on the following observations. Claim 1. If c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 satisfy both the individual rationality and the non-deficit constraints, then ci = 0 for i = 0, . . . , m. Proof. First, let us prove that c0 = 0. Consider the bid vector in which ˆvi = 0 for all i. To obtain individual rationality, we must have c0 ≥ 0. To satisfy the non-deficit constraint, we must have c0 ≤ 0. Thus we know c0 = 0. Now, if ci = 0 for all i, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, let j = min{i|ci = 0}. Assume that j ≤ m. We recall that we can write the individual rationality constraint as follows: zn = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +c3ˆv3 +. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2 +cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for any bid vector. Let us consider the bid vector in which ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for the rest. In this case zn = cj, so we must have cj ≥ 0. The non-deficit constraint can be written as follows: z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 for any bid vector. Consider the same bid vector as above. We have zi = 0 for i ≤ j, because for these bids, the jth highest other bid has value 0, so all the ci that are nonzero are multiplied by 0. For i > j, we have zi = cj, because the jth highest other bid has value 1, and all lower bids have value 0. So the non-deficit constraint tells us that cj(n − j) ≤ mˆvm+1. Because j ≤ m, ˆvm+1 = 0, so the right hand side is 0. We also have n − j > 0 because j ≤ m < n. So cj ≤ 0. Because we have already established that cj ≥ 0, it follows that cj = 0; but this is contrary to assumption. So j > m. Incidentally, this claim also shows that if m = n − 1, then ci = 0 for all i. Thus, we are stuck with the VCG mechanism. From here on, we only consider the case where m < n − 1. Claim 2. The individual rationality constraint can be written as follows: Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. Before proving this claim, we introduce the following lemma. Lemma 1. Given a positive integer k and a set of real constants s1, s2, . . . , sk, (s1t1 + s2t2 + . . . + sktk ≥ 0 for any t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tk ≥ 0) if and only if ( Pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k). Proof. Let di = ti −ti+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k−1, and dk = tk. Then (s1t1 +s2t2 +. . .+sktk ≥ 0 for any t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tk ≥ 0) is equivalent to (( P1 i=1 si)d1 + ( P2 i=1 si)d2 + . . . + ( Pk i=1 si)dk ≥ 0 for any set of arbitrary non-negative dj). When Pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, the above inequality is obviously true. If for some j, Pj i=1 si < 0, if we set dj > 0 and di = 0 for all i = j, then the above inequality becomes false. So Pj i=1 si ≥ 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k is both necessary and sufficient. We are now ready to present the proof of Claim 2. Proof. The individual rationality constraint can be written as zn = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 + . . . + cn−2ˆvn−2 + cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn−1 ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. We have already shown that ci = 0 for i ≤ m. Thus, the above can be simplified to zn = cm+1ˆvm+1 + cm+2ˆvm+2+. . .+cn−2ˆvn−2+cn−1ˆvn−1 ≥ 0 for any bid vector. By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. Claim 3. The non-deficit constraint and the worst-case constraint can also be written as linear inequalities involving only the ci and k. Proof. The non-deficit constraint requires that for any bid vector, z1 +z2 +. . .+zn ≤ mˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 + 33 c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 +ciˆvi+1 +. . .+cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to qm+1ˆvm+1 + qm+2ˆvm+2 + . . . + qnˆvn ≥ 0 qm+1 = m − (n − m − 1)cm+1 qi = −(i−1)ci−1 −(n−i)ci, for i = m+2, . . . , n−1 (when m + 2 > n − 1, this set of equalities is empty) qn = −(n − 1)cn−1 By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n. So, we can simplify further as follows: qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m qm+1 + . . . + qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n Pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 qm+1 + . . . + qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m So, the non-deficit constraint can be written as a set of linear inequalities involving only the ci. The worst-case constraint can be also written as a set of linear inequalities, by the following reasoning. The worstcase constraint requires that for any bid input z1 +z2 +. . .+ zn ≥ kmˆvm+1, where zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +. . .+ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Because ci = 0 for i ≤ m, we can simplify this inequality to Qm+1ˆvm+1 + Qm+2ˆvm+2 + . . . + Qnˆvn ≥ 0 Qm+1 = (n − m − 1)cm+1 − km Qi = (i − 1)ci−1 + (n − i)ci, for i = m + 2, . . . , n − 1 Qn = (n − 1)cn−1 By the above lemma, this is equivalent to Pj i=m+1 Qi ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n. So, we can simplify further as follows: Qm+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≥ km Qm+1 + . . . + Qm+i ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n Pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≥ km for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 Qm+1 + . . . + Qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≥ km So, the worst-case constraint can also be written as a set of linear inequalities involving only the ci and k. Combining all the claims, we see that the original optimization problem can be transformed into the following linear program. Variables: cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn−1, k Maximize k (the percentage redistributed in the worst case) Subject to:Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1 km ≤ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n Pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m 6. NUMERICAL RESULTS For selected values of n and m, we solved the linear program using Glpk (GNU Linear Programming Kit). In the table below, we present the results for a single unit (m = 1). We present 1−k (the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed by the worst-case optimal mechanism in the worst case) instead of k in the second column because writing k would require too many significant digits.

Perhaps more surprisingly, the worst-case optimal mechanism sometimes does better in the worst case than the BaileyCavallo mechanism does on average, as the following example shows. Recall that the total redistribution payment of the BaileyCavallo mechanism is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1. For the single-unit case, this simplifies to 2 n ˆv3 + n−2 n ˆv2. Hence the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is ˆv2− 2 n ˆv3− n−2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 , which has an expected value of E( 2 n − 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2 ) = 2 n − 2 n E ˆv3 ˆv2 . Suppose the bid values are drawn from a uniform distribution over [0, 1]. The theory of order statistics tells us that the 34 joint probability density function of ˆv2 and ˆv3 is f(ˆv3, ˆv2) = n(n − 1)(n − 2)ˆvn−3 3 (1 − ˆv2) for ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3. Now, E ˆv3 ˆv2 = R 1 0 R ˆv2 0 ˆv3 ˆv2 f(ˆv3, ˆv2)dˆv3dˆv2 = n−2 n−1 . So, the expected value of the remaining percentage is 2 n − 2 n n−2 n−1 = 2 n(n−1) . For n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case. Let us present the optimal solution for the case n = 5 in detail. By solving the above linear program, we find that the optimal values for the ci are c2 = 11 45 , c3 = −1 9 , and c4 = 1 15 . That is, the redistribution payment received by each agent is: 11 45 times the second highest bid among the other agents, minus 1 9 times the third highest bid among the other agents, plus 1 15 times the fourth highest bid among the other agents. The total amount redistributed is 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 − 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5; in the worst case, 11 15 ˆv2 is redistributed. Hence, the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is never more than 4 15 = 26.7%. Finally, we compare the worst-case optimal mechanism to the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, n = m + 2, . . . , 30. These results are in Figure 1. We see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the BaileyCavallo mechanism). When n > m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism outperforms the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). 7. ANALYTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE WORST-CASE OPTIMAL MECHANISM We recall that our linear program has the following form: Variables: cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn−1, k Maximize k (the percentage redistributed in the worst case) Subject to:Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1 km ≤ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n Pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m A linear program has no solution if and only if either the objective is unbounded, or the constraints are contradictory (there is no feasible solution). It is easy to see that k is bounded above by 1 (redistributing more than 100% violates the non-deficit constraint). Also, a feasible solution always exists, for example, k = 0 and ci = 0 for all i. So an optimal solution always exists. Observe that the linear program model depends only on the number of agents n and the number of units m. Hence the optimal solution is a function of n and m. It turns out that this optimal solution can be analytically characterized as follows. Theorem 1. For any m and n with n ≥ m+2, the worstcase optimal mechanism (among linear VCG redistribution mechanisms) is unique. For this mechanism, the percentage redistributed in the worst case is k∗ = 1 − `n−1 m ´ Pn−1 j=m `n−1 j ´ The worst-case optimal mechanism is characterized by the following values for the ci: c∗ i = (−1)i+m−1 (n − m) `n−1 m−1 ´ i Pn−1 j=m `n−1 j ´ 1 `n−1 i ´ n−1X j=i n − 1 j ! for i = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. It should be noted that we have proved ci = 0 for i ≤ m in Claim 1. Proof. We first rewrite the linear program as follows. We introduce new variables xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xn−1, defined by xj = Pj i=m+1 ci for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. The linear program then becomes: Variables: xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xn−1, k Maximize k Subject to: km ≤ (n − m − 1)xm+1 ≤ m km ≤ (m + i)xm+i−1 + (n − m − i)xm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ nxn−1 ≤ m xi ≥ 0 for i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 We will prove that for any optimal solution to this linear program, k = k∗ . Moreover, we will prove that when k = k∗ , xj = Pj i=m+1 c∗ i for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1. This will prove the theorem. We first make the following observations: (n − m − 1)c∗ m+1 = (n − m − 1) (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (m+1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 m+1) Pn−1 j=m+1 `n−1 j ´ = (n − m − 1) (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (m+1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 m+1) ( Pn−1 j=m `n−1 j ´ − `n−1 m ´ ) = (n − m − 1) m n−m−1 − (n − m − 1) m(n−1 m ) (n−m−1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) = m − (1 − k∗ )m = k∗ m For i = m + 1, . . . , n − 2, ic∗ i + (n − i − 1)c∗ i+1 = i (−1)i+m−1 (n−m)(n−1 m−1) i Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 i ) Pn−1 j=i `n−1 j ´ + (n − i − 1) (−1)i+m (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (i+1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 i+1 ) Pn−1 j=i+1 `n−1 j ´ = (−1)i+m−1 (n−m)(n−1 m−1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 i ) Pn−1 j=i `n−1 j ´ − (n − i − 1) (−1)i+m−1 (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (i+1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) i+1 (n−1 i )(n−i−1) Pn−1 j=i+1 `n−1 j ´ = (−1)i+m−1 (n−m)(n−1 m−1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) = (−1)i+m−1 m(1 − k∗ ) Finally, (n − 1)c∗ n−1 = (n − 1) (−1)n+m (n−m)(n−1 m−1) (n−1) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) 1 (n−1 n−1) Pn−1 j=n−1 `n−1 j ´ = (−1)m+n m(1 − k∗ ) Summarizing the above, we have: (n − m − 1)c∗ m+1 = k∗ m (m + 1)c∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)c∗ m+2 = m(1 − k∗ ) (m + 2)c∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)c∗ m+3 = −m(1 − k∗ ) (m + 3)c∗ m+3 + (n − m − 4)c∗ m+4 = m(1 − k∗ ) ... 35 (n − 3)c∗ n−3 + 2c∗ n−2 = (−1)m+n−2 m(1 − k∗ ) (n − 2)c∗ n−2 + c∗ n−1 = (−1)m+n−1 m(1 − k∗ ) (n − 1)c∗ n−1 = (−1)m+n m(1 − k∗ ) Let x∗ j = Pj i=m+1 c∗ i for j = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1, the first equation in the above tells us that (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1 = k∗ m. By adding the first two equations, we get (m + 2)x∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2 = m By adding the first three equations, we get (m + 3)x∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3 = k∗ m By adding the first i equations, where i = 2, . . . , n−m−1, we get (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = m if i is even (m + i)x∗ m+i−1 + (n − m − i)x∗ m+i = k∗ m if i is odd Finally by adding all the equations, we get nx∗ n−1 = m if n − m is even; nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m if n − m is odd. Thus, for all of the constraints other than the nonnegativity constraints, we have shown that they are satisfied by setting xj = x∗ j = Pj i=m+1 c∗ i and k = k∗ . We next show that the nonnegativity constraints are satisfied by these settings as well. For m + 1 ≤ i, i + 1 ≤ n − 1, we have 1 i Pn−1 j=i (n−1 j ) (n−1 i ) = 1 i Pn−1 j=i i!(n−1−i)! j!(n−1−j)! ≥ 1 i+1 Pn−2 j=i i!(n−1−i)! j!(n−1−j)! ≥ 1 i+1 Pn−2 j=i (i+1)!(n−1−i−1)! (j+1)!(n−1−j−1)! = 1 i+1 Pn−1 j=i+1 (n−1 j ) (n−1 i+1 ) This implies that the absolute value of c∗ i is decreasing as i increases (if the c∗ contains more than one number). We further observe that the sign of c∗ i alternates, with the first element c∗ m+1 positive. So x∗ j = Pj i=m+1 c∗ i ≥ 0 for all j. Thus, we have shown that these xi = x∗ i together with k = k∗ form a feasible solution of the linear program. We proceed to show that it is in fact the unique optimal solution. First we prove the following claim: Claim 4. If ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 satisfy the following inequalities: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)ˆxm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)ˆxm+i−1 + (n − m − i)ˆxm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 ˆkm ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ m ˆk ≥ k∗ Then we must have that ˆxi = ˆx∗ i and ˆk = k∗ . Proof of claim. Consider the first inequality. We know that (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1 = k∗ m, so (n − m − 1)ˆxm+1 ≥ ˆkm ≥ k∗ m = (n − m − 1)x∗ m+1. It follows that ˆxm+1 ≥ x∗ m+1 (n − m − 1 = 0). Now, consider the next inequality for i = 2. We know that (m + 2)x∗ m+1 + (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2 = m. It follows that (n−m−2)ˆxm+2 ≤ m−(m+2)ˆxm+1 ≤ m−(m+2)x∗ m+1 = (n − m − 2)x∗ m+2, so ˆxm+2 ≤ x∗ m+2 (i = 2 ≤ n − m − 1 ⇒ n − m − 2 = 0). Now consider the next inequality for i = 3. We know that (m + 3)x∗ m+2 + (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3 = m. It follows that (n−m−3)ˆxm+3 ≥ ˆkm−(m+3)ˆxm+2 ≥ k∗ m−(m+3)x∗ m+2 = (n − m − 3)x∗ m+3, so ˆxm+3 ≥ x∗ m+3 (i = 3 ≤ n − m − 1 ⇒ n − m − 3 = 0). Proceeding like this all the way up to i = n−m−1, we get that ˆxm+i ≥ x∗ m+i if i is odd and ˆxm+i ≤ x∗ m+i if i is even. Moreover, if one inequality is strict, then all subsequent inequalities are strict. Now, if we can prove ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1, it would follow that the x∗ i are equal to the ˆxi (which also implies that ˆk = k∗ ). We consider two cases: Case 1: n − m is even. We have: n − m even ⇒ n − m − 1 odd ⇒ ˆxn−1 ≥ x∗ n−1. We also have: n−m even ⇒ nx∗ n−1 = m. Combining these two, we get m = nx∗ n−1 ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ m ⇒ ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1. Case 2: n − m is odd. In this case, we have ˆxn−1 ≤ x∗ n−1, and nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m. Then, we have: k∗ m ≤ ˆkm ≤ nˆxn−1 ≤ nx∗ n−1 = k∗ m ⇒ ˆxn−1 = x∗ n−1. This completes the proof of the claim. It follows that if ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n − 1 is a feasible solution and ˆk ≥ k∗ , then since all the inequalities in Claim 4 are satisfied, we must have ˆxi = x∗ i and ˆk = k∗ . Hence no other feasible solution is as good as the one described in the theorem. Knowing the analytical characterization of the worst-case optimal mechanism provides us with at least two major benefits. First, using these formulas is computationally more efficient than solving the linear program using a generalpurpose solver. Second, we can derive the following corollary. Corollary 1. If the number of units m is fixed, then as the number of agents n increases, the worst-case percentage redistributed linearly converges to 1, with a rate of convergence 1 2 . (That is, limn→∞ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = 1 2 . That is, in the limit, the percentage that is not redistributed halves for every additional agent.) We note that this is consistent with the experimental data for the single-unit case, where the worst-case remaining percentage roughly halves each time we add another agent. The worst-case percentage that is redistributed under the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism also converges to 1 as the number of agents goes to infinity, but the convergence is much slower-it does not converge linearly (that is, letting kC n be the percentage redistributed by the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism in the worst case for n agents, limn→∞ 1−kC n+1 1−kC n = limn→∞ n n+1 = 1). We now present the proof of the corollary. Proof. When the number of agents is n, the worst-case percentage redistributed is k∗ n = 1 − (n−1 m ) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) . When the number of agents is n + 1, the percentage becomes k∗ n+1 = 1 − (n m) Pn j=m (n j ) . For n sufficiently large, we will have 2n − mnm−1 > 0, and hence 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = (n m) Pn−1 j=m (n−1 j ) (n−1 m ) Pn j=m (n j ) = n n−m 2n−1 − Pm−1 j=0 (n−1 j ) 2n− Pm−1 j=0 (n j ) , and n n−m 2n−1 −m(n−1)m−1 2n ≤ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n ≤ n n−m 2n−1 2n−mnm−1 (because `n j ´ ≤ ni if j ≤ i). Since we have limn→∞ n n−m 2n−1 −m(n−1)m−1 2n = 1 2 , and limn→∞ n n−m 2n−1 2n−mnm−1 = 1 2 , it follows that limn→∞ 1−k∗ n+1 1−k∗ n = 1 2 . 36 8. WORST-CASE OPTIMALITY OUTSIDE THE FAMILY In this section, we prove that the worst-case optimal redistribution mechanism among linear VCG redistribution mechanisms is in fact optimal (in the worst case) among all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint. Thus, restricting our attention to linear VCG redistribution mechanisms did not come at a loss. To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma. This lemma is not new: it was informally stated by Cavallo [3]. For completeness, we present it here with a detailed proof. Lemma 2. A VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic, anonymous and strategy-proof if and only if there exists a function f : Rn−1 → R, so that the redistribution payment zi received by ai satisfies zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vectors. Proof. First, let us prove the only if direction, that is, if a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic, anonymous and strategy-proof then there exists a deterministic function f : Rn−1 → R, which makes zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vectors. If a VCG redistribution mechanism is deterministic and anonymous, then for any bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn, the mechanism outputs a unique redistribution payment list: z1, z2, . . . , zn. Let G : Rn → Rn be the function that maps ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn to z1, z2, . . . , zn for all bid vectors. Let H(i, x1, x2, . . . , xn) be the ith element of G(x1, x2, . . . , xn), so that zi = H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) for all bid vectors and all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Because the mechanism is anonymous, two agents should receive the same redistribution payment if their bids are the same. So, if ˆvi = ˆvj, H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = H(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn). Hence, if we let j = min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, then H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = H(j, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn). Let us define K : Rn → N × Rn as follows: K(y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = [j, w1, w2, . . . , wn], where w1, w2, . . . , wn are y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 sorted in descending order, and j = min{t|wt = y}. ({t|wt = y} = ∅ because y ∈ {w1, w2, . . . , wn}). Also let us define F : Rn → R by F(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) = H ◦ K(ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) = H(min{t|ˆvt = ˆvi}, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = H(i, ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn) = zi. That is, F is the redistribution payment to an agent that bids ˆvi when the other bids are ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn. Since our mechanism is required to be strategy-proof, and the space of valuations is unrestricted, zi should be independent of ˆvi by Lemma 1 in Cavallo [3]. Hence, we can simply ignore the first variable input to F; let f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = F(0, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1). So, we have for all bid vectors and i, zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn). This completes the proof for the only if direction. For the if direction, if the redistribution payment received by ai satisfies zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all bid vectors and i, then this is clearly a deterministic and anonymous mechanism. To prove strategy-proofness, we observe that because an agents redistribution payment is not affected by her own bid, her incentives are the same as in the VCG mechanism, which is strategy-proof. Now we are ready to introduce the next theorem: Theorem 2. For any m and n with n ≥ m+2, the worstcase optimal mechanism among the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms is worst-case optimal among all mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint. While we needed individual rationality earlier in the paper, this theorem does not mention it, that is, we can not find a mechanism with better worst-case performance even if we sacrifice individual rationality. (The worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism is of course individually rational.) Proof. Suppose there is a redistribution mechanism (when the number of units is m and the number of agents is n) that satisfies all of the above properties and has a better worstcase performance than the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism, that is, its worst-case redistribution percentage ˆk is strictly greater than k∗ . By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f : Rn−1 → R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vectors. We first prove that f has the following properties. Claim 5. f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. Proof of claim. We assumed that for this mechanism, the worst-case redistribution percentage satisfies ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0. If the total VCG payment is x, the total redistribution payment should be in [ˆkx, x] (non-deficit criterion). Consider the case where all agents bid 0, so that the total VCG payment is also 0. Hence, the total redistribution payment should be in [ˆk · 0, 0]-that is, it should be 0. Hence every agents redistribution payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0) must be 0. Now, let ti = f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) where the number of 1s equals i. We proved t0 = 0. If tn−1 = 0, consider the bid vector where everyone bids 1. The total VCG payment is m and the total redistribution payment is nf(1, 1, . . . , 1) = ntn−1 = 0. This corresponds to 0% redistribution, which is contrary to our assumption that ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0. Now, consider j = min{i|ti = 0} (which is well-defined because tn−1 = 0). If j > m, the property is satisfied. If j ≤ m, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. Under this bid vector, the first j agents each get redistribution payment tj−1 = 0, and the remaining n − j agents each get tj. Thus, the total redistribution payment is (n − j)tj. Because the total VCG payment for this bid vector is 0, we must have (n − j)tj = 0. So tj = 0 (j ≤ m < n). But this is contrary to the definition of j. Hence f(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 if the number of 1s is less than or equal to m. Claim 6. f satisfies the following inequalities: ˆkm ≤ (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m + i)tm+i−1 + (n − m − i)tm+i ≤ m for i = 2, 3, . . . , n − m − 1 ˆkm ≤ ntn−1 ≤ m Here ti is defined as in the proof of Claim 5. 37 Proof of claim. For j = m + 1, . . . , n, consider the bid vectors where ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ j and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. These bid vectors together with the non-deficit constraint and worst-case constraint produce the above set of inequalities: for example, when j = m + 1, we consider the bid vector ˆvi = 1 for i ≤ m + 1 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. The first m+1 agents each receive a redistribution payment of tm = 0, and all other agents each receive tm+1. Thus, the total VCG redistribution is (n − m − 1)tm+1. The nondeficit constraint gives (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≤ m (because the total VCG payment is m). The worst-case constraint gives (n − m − 1)tm+1 ≥ ˆkm. Combining these two, we get the first inequality. The other inequalities can be obtained in the same way. We now observe that the inequalities in Claim 6, together with ˆk ≥ k∗ , are the same as those in Claim 4 (where the ti are replaced by the ˆxi). Thus, we can conclude that ˆk = k∗ , which is contrary to our assumption ˆk > k∗ . Hence no mechanism satisfying all the listed properties has a redistribution percentage greater than k∗ in the worst case. So far we have only talked about the case where n ≥ m+2. For the purpose of completeness, we provide the following claim for the n = m + 1 case. Claim 7. For any m and n with n = m + 1, the original VCG mechanism (that is, redistributing nothing) is (uniquely) worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that are deterministic, anonymous, strategy-proof, efficient and satisfy the non-deficit constraint. We recall that when n = m+1, Claim 1 tells us that the only mechanism inside the family of linear redistribution mechanisms is the original VCG mechanism, so that this mechanism is automatically worst-case optimal inside this family. However, to prove the above claim, we need to show that it is worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that have the desired properties. Proof. Suppose a redistribution mechanism exists that satisfies all of the above properties and has a worst-case performance as good as the original VCG mechanism, that is, its worst-case redistribution percentage is greater than or equal to 0. This implies that the total redistribution payment of this mechanism is always nonnegative. By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f : Rn−1 → R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vectors. We will prove that f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0. First, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 0 for all i. Here, each agent receives a redistribution payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0). The total redistribution payment is then nf(0, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0 (by the above observation) as well less than or equal to 0 (using the nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total VCG payment is 0). It follows that f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0. Now, let us consider the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i. For this bid vector, the agent with the highest bid receives a redistribution payment of f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, and the other n − 1 agents each receive f(x1, 0, . . . , 0). By the same reasoning as above, the total redistribution payment should be both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0, hence f(x1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ 0. Proceeding by induction, let us assume f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ 0, for some k < n − 1. Consider the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi are arbitrary numbers satisfying x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. For the agents with the highest k + 1 bids, their redistribution payment is specified by f acting on an input with only k non-zero variables. Hence they all receive 0 by induction assumption. The other n − k − 1 agents each receive f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0). The total redistribution payment is then (n−k−1)f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to the total VCG payment. Now, in this bid vector, the lowest bid is 0 because k + 1 < n. But since n = m + 1, the total VCG payment is mˆvn = 0. So we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. By induction, this statement holds for all k < n − 1; when k + 1 = n − 1, we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−2, xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−2 ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0. Hence, in this mechanism, the redistribution payment is always 0; that is, the mechanism is just the original VCG mechanism. Incidentally, we obtain the following corollary: Corollary 2. No VCG redistribution mechanism satisfies all of the following: determinism, anonymity, strategyproofness, efficiency, and (strong) budget balance. This holds for any n ≥ m + 1. Proof. For the case n ≥ m + 2: If such a mechanism exists, its worst-case performance would be better than that of the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism, which by Theorem 1 obtains a redistribution percentage strictly less than 1. But Theorem 2 shows that it is impossible to outperform this mechanism in the worst case. For the case n = m + 1: If such a mechanism exists, it would perform as well as the original VCG mechanism in the worst case, which implies that it is identical to the VCG mechanism by Claim 7. But the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced. 9. CONCLUSIONS For allocation problems with one or more items, the wellknown Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a deficit. However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents payments will sum to more than 0. If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer. However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents. In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property. In this paper, we extended this result in a restricted setting. We studied allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].) Here we proposed a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment 38 back to the agents. All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit. The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case. We then provided an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear program. We gave both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case). Finally, we proved that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties. One important direction for future research is to try to extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit demand. However, it turns out that in sufficiently general settings, the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage is 0. In such settings, the worst-case criterion provides no guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism (even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case percentage), so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria. Alternatively, one can try to identify other special settings in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible. Another direction for future research is to consider whether this mechanism has applications to collusion. For example, in a typical collusive scheme, there is a bidding ring consisting of a number of colluders, who submit only a single bid [10, 17]. If this bid wins, the colluders must allocate the item amongst themselves, perhaps using payments-but of course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring. This work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case. Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue). Some more recent papers have focused on designing mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive analysis (e.g. [9, 1, 15, 8]). There has also been growing interest in the design of online mechanisms [7] where the agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before all the agents have arrived. Such work often also takes a worst-case competitive analysis approach [14, 13]. It does not appear that there are direct connections between our work and these other works that focus on designing mechanisms that perform well in the worst case. Nevertheless, it seems likely that future research will continue to investigate mechanism design for the worst case, and hopefully a coherent framework will emerge. 10. REFERENCES [1] G. Aggarwal, A.

Mingyu@cs.duke.edu Vincent Conitzer Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación de la Universidad de Duke Durham, NC, EE. UU.Problemas de asignación con uno o más elementos, el conocido mecanismo de Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) es eficiente, a prueba de estrategias, individualmente racional y no incurre en un déficit. Sin embargo, el mecanismo VCG no está (fuertemente) el presupuesto equilibrado: en general, los pagos de los agentes sumarán más de 0. Si hay un subastador que está vendiendo los artículos, esto puede ser deseable, porque el pago excedente corresponde a los ingresos para el subastador. Sin embargo, si los artículos no tienen un propietario y los agentes simplemente están interesados en asignar los artículos de manera eficiente entre ellos, cualquier pago excedente es indeseable, ya que tendrá que fluir del sistema de agentes. En 2006, Cavallo [3] propuso un mecanismo que redistribuye parte del pago de VCG a los agentes, al tiempo que mantiene la eficiencia, la resistencia a la estrategia, la racionalidad individual y la propiedad no déficit. En este artículo, ampliamos este resultado en una configuración restringida. Estudiamos configuraciones de asignación donde hay múltiples unidades indistinguibles de un solo bien, y los agentes tienen demanda de unidades.(Para este entorno específico, el mecanismo de Cavallos coincide con un mecanismo propuesto por Bailey en 1997 [2]. Aquí proponemos una familia de mecanismos que redistribuyen parte del pago de VCG a los agentes. Todos los mecanismos de la familia son eficientes, a prueba de estrategias, individualmente racionales y nunca incurren en un déficit. La familia incluye el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo como un caso especial. Luego proporcionamos un modelo de optimización para encontrar el mecanismo óptimo, es decir, el mecanismo que maximiza la redistribución en el peor de los casos en la familia y muestra cómo lanzar este modelo como un programa lineal. Damos soluciones numéricas y analíticas de este programa lineal, y el mecanismo (único) resultante muestra una mejora significativa sobre el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo (en el peor de los casos). Finalmente, demostramos que el mecanismo obtenido es óptimo entre todos los mecanismos deterministas anónimos que satisfacen las propiedades anteriores.

Introducción Muchos problemas importantes en informática y comercio electrónico pueden modelarse como problemas de asignación de recursos. En tales problemas, queremos asignar los recursos (o elementos) a los agentes que más los valoran. Desafortunadamente, las valoraciones de los agentes son conocimientos privados, y los agentes interesados en sí mismos mentirán sobre sus valoraciones si esto es para su beneficio. Una solución es subastar los artículos, posiblemente en una subasta combinatoria donde los agentes pueden ofertar por paquetes de artículos. Existen formas de determinar los pagos que los agentes realizan en una subasta que incentiva a los agentes a informar sus verdaderas valoraciones, es decir, los pagos hacen que la estrategia de subasta sea a prueba de estrategias. Una forma muy general de hacerlo es usar el mecanismo VCG [23, 4, 12].(El mecanismo VCG también se conoce como mecanismo Clarke o, en el contexto específico de las subastas, la subasta generalizada de Vickrey). Además de la prueba de la estrategia, el mecanismo VCG tiene varias otras propiedades agradables en el contexto de problemas de asignación de recursos. Es eficiente: la asignación elegida siempre maximiza la suma de las valoraciones de los agentes. También es (expost) individualmente racional: participar en el mecanismo nunca empeora a un agente que no participando. Finalmente, tiene una propiedad sin déficit: la suma de los pagos de los agentes siempre es no negativa. En muchos entornos, otra propiedad que sería deseable es el saldo presupuestario (fuerte), lo que significa que los pagos suman exactamente 0. Supongamos que los agentes están tratando de distribuir algunos recursos entre ellos que no tienen un propietario anterior. Por ejemplo, los agentes pueden estar tratando de asignar el derecho de usar un bien compartido en un día determinado. O bien, los agentes pueden estar tratando de asignar un recurso que han construido, descubierto o obtenido colectivamente. Si los agentes usan una subasta para asignar estos recursos, y la suma de los pagos de los agentes en la subasta es positivo, entonces este pago excedente debe dejar el sistema 30 de los agentes (por ejemplo, los agentes deben dar el dinero a una parte externa, o quemarlo). La redistribución de Na¨ıve del pago excedente (por ejemplo, cada uno de los n agentes recibe 1/n del excedente) generalmente dará como resultado un mecanismo que no es a prueba de estrategias (por ejemplo, en una subasta de Vickrey, el segundo postor más alto querríaAumente su oferta para obtener un pago de redistribución mayor). Desafortunadamente, el mecanismo VCG no está equilibrado con el presupuesto: por lo general, hay un pago excedente. Desafortunadamente, en entornos generales, de hecho es imposible diseñar mecanismos que satisfagan el equilibrio presupuestario además de las otras propiedades deseables [16, 11, 21]. A la luz de este resultado de imposibilidad, varios autores han obtenido el equilibrio presupuestario al sacrificar algunas de las otras propiedades deseables [2, 6, 22, 5]. Otro enfoque que quizás sea preferible es utilizar un mecanismo que esté más equilibrado con el presupuesto que el mecanismo VCG, y mantiene todas las demás propiedades deseables. Una forma de tratar de diseñar dicho mecanismo es redistribuir parte del pago de VCG a los agentes de una manera que no afectará los incentivos de los agentes (de modo que se mantenga la prueba de la estrategia), y eso mantendrá las otras propiedades. En 2006, Cavallo [3] siguió exactamente esta idea y diseñó un mecanismo que redistribuye una gran cantidad del pago total de VCG mientras mantiene todas las otras propiedades deseables del mecanismo VCG. Por ejemplo, en una subasta de un solo elemento (donde el mecanismo de VCG coincide con la subasta de 50 precio), la cantidad redistribuida al postor I por mecanismo Cavallos es 1/n la segunda oferta más alta entre ofertas que no sean.licitación. El total redistribuido es como máximo la segunda oferta más alta en general, y la redistribución al agente I no afecta es incentivos porque no depende de su propia oferta. En este artículo, restringimos nuestra atención a una configuración limitada, y en este entorno extendemos el resultado de Cavallos. Estudiamos configuraciones de asignación en las que hay múltiples unidades indistinguibles de un solo bien, y todos los agentes tienen demanda de unidades, es decir, solo quieren una unidad. Para este entorno específico, el mecanismo de Cavallos coincide con un mecanismo propuesto por Bailey en 1997 [2]. Aquí proponemos la familia de mecanismos lineales de redistribución de VCG. Todos los mecanismos de esta familia son eficientes, a prueba de estrategias, individualmente racionales y nunca incurren en un déficit. La familia incluye el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo como un caso especial (con la advertencia de que solo estudiamos la configuración de asignación con múltiples unidades indistinguibles de una sola demanda de bien y unidades, mientras que los mecanismos de Baileys y Cavallos también se pueden aplicar fuera de estos entornos). Luego proporcionamos un modelo de optimización para encontrar el mecanismo óptimo dentro de la familia, basado en el análisis del peor de los casos. Se proporcionan soluciones numéricas y analíticas de este modelo, y el mecanismo resultante muestra una mejora significativa sobre el mecanismo de Baileycavallo (en el peor de los casos). Por ejemplo, para el problema de asignar una sola unidad, cuando el número de agentes es de 10, nuestro mecanismo siempre redistribuye más del 98% del pago total de VCG a los agentes (mientras que el mecanismo de Bailey-Cavallo redistribuye solo el 80% en elpeor de los casos). Finalmente, demostramos que nuestro mecanismo es de hecho óptimo entre todos los mecanismos deterministas anónimos (incluso los no lineales) que satisfacen las propiedades deseables. Casi al mismo tiempo, el mismo mecanismo ha sido derivado de forma independiente por Moulin [19] .1 Moulin en realidad persigue un objetivo diferente (también basado en el análisis del peor de los casos): mientras que nuestro objetivo es maximizar el porcentaje de pagos de VCG que se redistribuyen,Moulin intenta minimizar los pagos generales de los agentes como un porcentaje de eficiencia. Resulta que los mecanismos resultantes son los mismos. Hacia el final de este documento, consideramos dejar caer el requisito de racionalidad individual y mostrar que esto no cambia el mecanismo óptimo para nuestro objetivo. Para el objetivo de Moulins, la caída de la racionalidad individual cambia el mecanismo óptimo (pero solo si hay varias unidades).2. Descripción del problema Deja que n denote el número de agentes y deje que M denote el número de unidades. Solo consideramos el caso donde M <n (de lo contrario, el problema se vuelve trivial). También suponemos que M y N siempre son conocidos.(Esta suposición no es dañina: en entornos donde cualquiera puede unirse a la subasta, ejecutar un mecanismo de redistribución generalmente no es una buena idea de todos modos, porque todos querrían unirse para recolectar parte de la redistribución). Deje que el conjunto de agentes sea {A1, A2 ,..., un}, donde ai es el agente con el valor de informe más alto ˆvi-que es, tenemos ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. Deje que VI denote el verdadero valor de AI. Dado que el mecanismo es a prueba de estrategias, podemos asumir vi = ˆVI. Bajo el mecanismo VCG, cada agente entre A1 ,..., AM gana una unidad y paga ˆvm+1 por esta unidad. Por lo tanto, el pago total de VCG es igual a mˆvm+1. Cuando M = 1, esta es la subasta de segundo precio o Vickrey. Modificamos el mecanismo de la siguiente manera. Después de ejecutar el mecanismo VCG original, el centro regresa a cada agente ai cierta cantidad Zi, el pago de redistribución del agente AIS. No permitimos que Zi dependa de ˆVi;Debido a esto, los incentivos de AIS no se ven afectados por este pago de redistribución, y el mecanismo sigue siendo a prueba de estrategias.3. Mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales Ahora estamos listos para introducir la familia de mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales. Tal mecanismo está definido por un vector de constantes C0, C1 ,..., cn - 1. La cantidad que el mecanismo vuelve al agente ai es zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 +...+ Ci - 1ˆVi - 1 + Ciˆvi + 1 +...+ cn - 1ˆvn. Es decir, un agente recibe C0, más C1 veces la oferta más alta que no sea la oferta de los agentes, más C2 veces la segunda oferta más alta, etc. El mecanismo es a prueba de estrategias, porque para todo i, Zi es independiente de ˆVI. Además, el mecanismo es anónimo. Es útil ver la lista completa de pagos de redistribución: Z1 = C0 + C1ˆv2 + C2ˆv3 + C3ˆv4 +...+ cn - 2ˆvn - 1 + cn - 1ˆvn z2 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv3 + c3ˆv4 +...+ cn - 2ˆvn - 1 + cn - 1ˆvn z3 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv4 +...+ cn - 2ˆvn - 1 + cn - 1ˆvn z4 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 +...+ cn - 2ˆvn - 1 + cn - 1ˆvn...Zi = C0 + C1ˆv1 + C2ˆv2 +...+ Ci - 1ˆVi - 1 + Ciˆvi + 1 +...+ cn - 1ˆvn...Zn - 2 = C0 + C1ˆv1 + C2ˆv2 + C3ˆv3 +...+ cn - 2ˆvn - 1 + cn - 1ˆvn zn - 1 = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + c3ˆv3 +...+ Cn - 2ˆvn - 2 + Cn - 1ˆvn Zn = C0 + C1ˆv1 + C2ˆv2 + C3ˆv3 +...+ Cn - 2ˆvn - 2 + Cn - 1ˆvn - 1 1 Agradecemos a Rakesh Vohra por señalarnos al papel de trabajo Moulins.31 No todas las opciones de las constantes c0 ,..., CN - 1 produce un mecanismo que es individualmente racional, y no todas las opciones de las constantes producen un mecanismo que nunca incurre en un déficit. Por lo tanto, para obtener estas propiedades, necesitamos colocar algunas restricciones en las constantes. Para satisfacer el criterio de racionalidad individual, la utilidad de cada agente siempre debe ser no negativa. Un agente que no gana una unidad obtiene una utilidad que es igual al pago de redistribución de agentes. Un agente que gana una unidad obtiene una utilidad que es igual a la valoración de los agentes para la unidad, menos el pago de VCG ˆvm+1, más el pago de redistribución de los agentes. Considere el agente AN, el agente con la oferta más baja. Dado que este agente no gana un artículo (m <n), su utilidad es solo su pago de redistribución Zn. Por lo tanto, para que el mecanismo sea individualmente racional, el CI debe ser tal que Zn siempre sea no negativo. Si el CI tiene esta propiedad, entonces se deduce que Zi no es negativo por cada i, por la siguiente razón. Supongamos que existe algunos i <n y algún vector de ofertas ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 tal que zi <0. Luego, considere el vector de oferta que resulta de reemplazar ˆVj por ˆVJ+1 para todos J ≥ I, y dejar ˆVn = 0. Si omitimos ˆvn de este vector, el mismo vector resulta que resulta de omitir ˆvi del vector original. Por lo tanto, el pago de redistribución de ANS bajo el nuevo vector debe ser el mismo que el pago de redistribución de AIS bajo el antiguo vector, pero este pago es negativo. Si todos los pagos de redistribución siempre son no negativos, entonces el mecanismo debe ser racional individualmente (porque el mecanismo VCG es individualmente racional y el pago de redistribución solo aumenta la utilidad de los agentes). Por lo tanto, el mecanismo es individualmente racional si y solo si es para algún vector de oferta, Zn ≥ 0. Para satisfacer el criterio no débil, la suma de los pagos de redistribución debe ser menor o igual al pago total de VCG. Entonces, para cualquier vector de oferta ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆvn ≥ 0, las constantes CI deben hacer Z1 + Z2 +...+ Zn ≤ mˆvm+ 1. Definimos que la familia de mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales es el conjunto de todos los mecanismos de redistribución correspondientes a constantes CI que satisfacen las restricciones anteriores (de modo que los mecanismos sean individualmente racionales y tengan la propiedad sin déficit). Ahora damos dos ejemplos de mecanismos en esta familia. Ejemplo 1 (mecanismo de Bailey-Cavallo): considere el mecanismo correspondiente a CM+1 = M n y Ci = 0 para todos los demás i. Según este mecanismo, cada agente recibe un pago de redistribución de m n veces la (m+1) la más alta oferta de otro agente. Por lo tanto, A1 ,..., AM+1 recibe un pago de redistribución de m n ˆvm+2, y los otros reciben m n ˆvm+1. Por lo tanto, el pago de redistribución total es (m+1) m n ˆvm+2+(n - m− 1) m n ˆvm+1. Este mecanismo de redistribución es individualmente racional, porque todos los pagos de redistribución no son negativos y nunca incurre en un déficit, porque (m+1) m n ˆvm+2+(n - m - 1) m n ˆvm+1 ≤ nm n ˆvm+1 =mˆvm+1.(Observamos que para que este mecanismo tenga sentido, necesitamos n ≥ m + 2.) Ejemplo 2: Considere el mecanismo correspondiente a CM+1 = M N - M - 1, CM+2 = - M (M+1) (N - M - 1) (N - M - 2) y CI = 0 para todosOtros i. En este mecanismo, cada agente recibe un pago de redistribución de M N - M - 1 veces el (m + 1) el valor más alto reportado de otros agentes, menos m (m + 1) (n - m - 1) (n - m−2) veces el (m+2) el valor más alto reportado de otros agentes. Por lo tanto, el pago de redistribución total es mˆvm+1 - m (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2) ˆvm+3. Si n ≥ 2m+3 (que es equivalente a m n - m - 1 ≥ m (m+1) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2)), entonces cada agente siempre recibe un pago de redistribución no negativa, por lo tanto,El mecanismo es individualmente racional. Además, el mecanismo nunca incurre en un déficit, porque el pago total de VCG es mˆvm+1, que es mayor que la cantidad mˆvm+1 - m (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n−m - 2) ˆvm+3 que se redistribuye. ¿Cuál de estos dos mecanismos es mejor? ¿Hay otro mecanismo que sea aún mejor? Esto es lo que estudiamos en la siguiente sección.4. Mecanismos de redistribución óptimos Entre todos los mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales, nos gustaría poder identificar el que redistribuye el mayor porcentaje del pago total de VCG.2 Esta no es una noción bien definida: puede ser que un mecanismo redistribuya másAlgunos vectores de oferta y otro más sobre otros vectores de ofertas. Hacemos hincapié en que no asumimos que una distribución previa sobre las valoraciones de los licitantes está disponible, por lo que no podemos compararlas en función de la redistribución esperada. A continuación, estudiamos tres formas bien definidas de comparar los mecanismos de redistribución: el mejor rendimiento de los casos, el dominio y el peor desempeño. El mejor rendimiento de los casos. Una forma de evaluar un mecanismo es considerar el mayor porcentaje de redistribución que logra. Considere los dos ejemplos anteriores. Para el primer ejemplo, el pago de redistribución total es (m + 1) m n ˆvm + 2 + (n - m - 1) m n ˆvm + 1. Cuando ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1, esto es igual al pago total de VCG mˆvm+1. Por lo tanto, este mecanismo redistribuye el 100% del pago total de VCG en el mejor de los mejores casos. Para el segundo ejemplo, el pago de redistribución total es mˆvm+1 - m (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2) ˆvm+3. Cuando ˆvm+3 = 0, esto es igual al pago total de VCG mˆvm+1. Por lo tanto, este mecanismo también redistribuye el 100% del pago total de VCG en el mejor caso. Además, en realidad hay infinitamente muchos mecanismos que redistribuyen el 100% del pago total de VCG en el mejor caso, por ejemplo, cualquier combinación convexa de los dos anteriores redistribuirá el 100% si ambos ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 y ˆvm+3 =0. Dominio. Dentro de la familia de mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales, decimos que un mecanismo domina otro mecanismo si el primero redistribuye al menos tanto como al otro para cualquier vector de oferta. Para los dos ejemplos anteriores, ninguno domina al otro, porque cada uno redistribuye el 100% en diferentes casos. Resulta que no hay un mecanismo en la familia que domine todos los demás mecanismos de la familia. Para suponer que existe tal mecanismo. Luego, debería dominar ambos ejemplos anteriores. Considere el pago VCG restante (el pago de VCG no se redistribuyó). El pago VCG restante del mecanismo dominante debe ser 0 siempre que ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 o ˆvm+3 = 0. Ahora, el pago VCG restante es una función lineal de ˆVI (redistribución lineal) y, por lo tanto, también una función polinomial. Lo anterior implica que esta función se puede escribir como (ˆvm+2 - ˆvm+1) (ˆvm+3) P (ˆv1, ˆv2, ...Use, entre otras cosas porque es invariante a escala: si multiplicamos todas las ofertas por la misma constante positiva (por ejemplo, si cambiamos las unidades reexpresando las ofertas en euros en lugar de dólares), no queremos el comportamientode nuestro mecanismo para cambiar.32 Función polinómica. Pero dado que la función debe ser lineal (tiene un grado como máximo 1), se deduce que p = 0. Por lo tanto, un mecanismo dominante siempre redistribuiría todo el pago de VCG, lo cual no es posible.(Si fuera posible, entonces nuestro peor mecanismo de redistribución óptimo también siempre redistribuiría todo el pago de VCG, y veremos más tarde que no lo hace). El peor rendimiento de los casos. Finalmente, podemos evaluar un mecanismo considerando el porcentaje de redistribución más bajo que garantiza. Para el primer ejemplo, el pago de redistribución total es (m+1) m n ˆvm+2+(n - m - 1) m n ˆvm+1, que es mayor o igual a (n - m - 1) m n ˆvm+1. Entonces, en el peor de los casos, que es cuando ˆvm+2 = 0, el porcentaje redistribuido es n - m - 1 n. Para el segundo ejemplo, el pago de redistribución total es mˆvm+1 - m (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2) ˆvm+3, que es mayor o igual amˆvm+1 (1− (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2)). Entonces, en el peor de los casos, que es cuando ˆvm+3 = ˆvm+1, el porcentaje redistribuido es 1 - (m+1) (m+2) (n - m - 1) (n - m - 2). Dado que suponemos que el número de agentes N y el número de unidades M son conocidos, podemos determinar qué mecanismo de ejemplo tiene el mejor rendimiento del peor de los casos al comparar las dos cantidades. Cuando n = 6 y M = 1, para el primer ejemplo (mecanismo de Bailey-Cavallo), el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos es 2 3, y para el segundo ejemplo, este porcentaje es 1 2, lo que implica que para este par deN y M, el primer mecanismo tiene un mejor rendimiento en el peor de los casos. Por otro lado, cuando n = 12 y M = 1, para el primer ejemplo, el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos es 5 6, y para el segundo ejemplo, este porcentaje es 14 15, lo que implica que esta vez el segundo mecanismotiene un mejor rendimiento del peor de los casos. Por lo tanto, parece más natural comparar mecanismos por el porcentaje del pago total de VCG que redistribuyen en el peor de los casos. Este porcentaje no está definido cuando el pago total de VCG es 0. Para lidiar con esto, técnicamente, definimos el porcentaje de redistribución del peor de los casos como la K más grande para que el monto total redistribuido sea al menos K veces el pago total de VCG, para todos los vectores de ofertas.(Por lo tanto, siempre que el monto total redistribuido sea al menos 0 cuando el pago total de VCG es 0, estos casos no afectan el peor porcentaje de casos). Esto corresponde al siguiente problema de optimización: maximice K (el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos) sujeto a: para cada vector de oferta ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆVn ≥ 0 Zn ≥ 0 (racionalidad individual) Z1 + Z2 +...+ Zn ≤ mˆvm + 1 (no déficit) Z1 + Z2 +...+ Zn ≥ kmˆvm + 1 (restricción en el peor de los casos) Recordamos que zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 +...+ Ci - 1ˆVi - 1 + Ciˆvi + 1 +...+ cn - 1ˆvn.5. Transformación a la programación lineal El problema de optimización dado en la sección anterior puede reescribirse como un programa lineal, basado en las siguientes observaciones. Reclamación 1. Si C0, C1 ,..., CN-1 satisface tanto la racionalidad individual como las restricciones no déficit, luego Ci = 0 para i = 0 ,..., m.Prueba. Primero, demostremos que C0 = 0. Considere el vector de oferta en el que ˆvi = 0 para todo i. Para obtener racionalidad individual, debemos tener C0 ≥ 0. Para satisfacer la restricción de no déficit, debemos tener C0 ≤ 0. Así sabemos C0 = 0. Ahora, si Ci = 0 para todo i, no hay nada que demostrar. De lo contrario, deje j = min {i | ci = 0}. Suponga que j ≤ m.Recordamos que podemos escribir la restricción de racionalidad individual de la siguiente manera: Zn = C0 +C1ˆv1 +C2ˆv2 +C3ˆv3 +... +Cn - 2ˆvn - 2 +Cn - 1ˆvn - 1 ≥ 0 para cualquier vector de oferta. Consideremos el vector de oferta en el que ˆvi = 1 para i ≤ j y ˆvi = 0 para el resto. En este caso Zn = CJ, por lo que debemos tener CJ ≥ 0. La restricción de no déficit se puede escribir de la siguiente manera: Z1 + Z2 +...+ Zn ≤ mˆvm+ 1 para cualquier vector de oferta. Considere el mismo vector de oferta que anteriormente. Tenemos zi = 0 para i ≤ j, porque para estas ofertas, la otra oferta más alta tiene valor 0, por lo que todos los CI que no son cero se multiplican por 0. Para i> j, tenemos zi = cj, porque la otra oferta más alta tiene valor 1, y todas las ofertas inferiores tienen valor 0. Entonces, la restricción de no déficit nos dice que CJ (N-J) ≤ Mˆvm+1. Porque j ≤ m, ˆvm+1 = 0, entonces el lado derecho es 0. También tenemos n - j> 0 porque j ≤ m <n.Entonces CJ ≤ 0. Debido a que ya hemos establecido que CJ ≥ 0, se deduce que CJ = 0;Pero esto es contrario a la suposición. Entonces j> m.Por cierto, esta afirmación también muestra que si M = N - 1, entonces Ci = 0 para todo i. Por lo tanto, estamos atascados con el mecanismo VCG. De aquí en adelante, solo consideramos el caso donde m <n - 1. Reclamación 2. La restricción de racionalidad individual se puede escribir de la siguiente manera: Pj I = M + 1 Ci ≥ 0 para J = M + 1 ,..., n - 1. Antes de probar este reclamo, presentamos el siguiente lema. Lema 1. Dado un entero positivo K y un conjunto de constantes reales S1, S2 ,..., SK, (S1T1 + S2T2 + ... + SKTK ≥ 0 para cualquier T1 ≥ T2 ≥ ... ≥ Tk ≥ 0) si y solo si (PJ I = 1 Si ≥ 0 para J = 1, 2, .. .. ..., k). Prueba. Deje di = ti −ti+1 para i = 1, 2 ,..., k - 1, y dk = tk. Entonces (s1t1 +s2t2 +... +sktk ≥ 0 para cualquier t1 ≥ t2 ≥ ... ≥ tk ≥ 0) es equivalente a ((p1 i = 1 si) d1 +(p2 i = 1 si) d2 +.. Cuando Pj I = 1 Si ≥ 0 para J = 1, 2 ,..., K, la desigualdad anterior es obviamente cierta. Si para algunos j, pj i = 1 si <0, si establecemos dj> 0 y di = 0 para todo i = j, entonces la desigualdad anterior se vuelve falsa. Entonces Pj I = 1 Si ≥ 0 para J = 1, 2 ,..., K es necesario y suficiente. Ahora estamos listos para presentar la prueba de reclamo 2. Prueba. La restricción de racionalidad individual se puede escribir como Zn = C0 + C1ˆv1 + C2ˆv2 + C3ˆv3 +...+ Cn - 2ˆvn - 2 + Cn - 1ˆvn - 1 ≥ 0 para cualquier vector BID ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆvn - 1 ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0. Ya hemos demostrado que Ci = 0 para i ≤ m.Por lo tanto, lo anterior se puede simplificar a Zn = cm+1ˆvm+1+cm+2ˆvm+2+...+Cn - 2ˆvn - 2+Cn - 1ˆvn - 1 ≥ 0 para cualquier vector de oferta. Por el lema anterior, esto es equivalente a PJ I = M + 1 CI ≥ 0 para J = M + 1 ,..., n - 1. Reclamación 3. La restricción no déficit y la restricción del peor de los casos también se pueden escribir como desigualdades lineales que involucran solo el CI y K.Prueba. La restricción de no déficit requiere que para cualquier vector de oferta, Z1 +Z2 +... +Zn ≤ mˆvm +1, donde zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +33 c2ˆv2 +... +Ci - 1ˆVi - 1 +Ciˆvi +1 +...+Cn - 1ˆvn para i = 1, 2 ,..., n.Porque Ci = 0 para i ≤ m, podemos simplificar esta desigualdad a QM+1ˆvm+1+QM+2ˆvm+2+...+qnˆvn ≥ 0 qm+1 = m - (n - m - 1) cm+1 qi = - (i - 1) ci - 1 - (n - i) Ci, para i = m+2 ,..., n - 1 (cuando m + 2> n - 1, este conjunto de igualdades está vacío) qn = - (n - 1) Cn - 1 por el lema anterior, esto es equivalente a pj i = m + 1 qi ≥ 0para j = m + 1 ,..., n.Por lo tanto, podemos simplificar aún más de la siguiente manera: QM+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (N - M - 1) CM+1 ≤ M QM+1+...+QM+I ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ N PJ = M+I - 1 J = M+1 CJ+(N - M - I) CM+I ≤ M para i = 2 ,..., N - M - 1 QM + 1 +...+ qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj = n-1 j = m+ 1 cj ≤ m Entonces, la restricción no déficit puede escribirse como un conjunto de desigualdades lineales que involucran solo el CI. La peor restricción de casos también se puede escribir como un conjunto de desigualdades lineales, por el siguiente razonamiento. La restricción del peor de los casos requiere que para cualquier entrada de oferta Z1 +Z2 +... +Zn ≥ kmˆvm +1, donde zi = c0 +c1ˆv1 +c2ˆv2 +... + Ci - 1ˆVi - 1 + Ciˆvi + 1 +...+ cn - 1ˆvn para i = 1, 2 ,..., n.Porque Ci = 0 para i ≤ m, podemos simplificar esta desigualdad a QM+1ˆvm+1+QM+2ˆvm+2+...+ Qnˆvn ≥ 0 qm + 1 = (n - m - 1) cm + 1 - km qi = (i - 1) ci - 1 + (n - i) Ci, para i = m + 2 ,..., n - 1 qn = (n - 1) Cn - 1 por el lema anterior, esto es equivalente a pj i = m + 1 qi ≥ 0 para j = m + 1 ,..., n.Por lo tanto, podemos simplificar aún más de la siguiente manera: QM+1 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (N - M - 1) cm+1 ≥ km QM+1+...+QM+I ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ N PJ = M+I - 1 J = M+1 CJ+(N - M - I) CM+I ≥ Km para i = 2 ,..., N - M - 1 QM + 1 +...+ Qn ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ n pj = n-1 j = m+ 1 cj ≥ km Por lo tanto, la restricción de peor caso también puede escribirse como un conjunto de desigualdades lineales que involucran solo el CI y K.Combinando todas las afirmaciones, vemos que el problema de optimización original puede transformarse en el siguiente programa lineal. Variables: CM+1, CM+2 ,..., Cn - 1, k maximizar k (el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos) sujeto a: PJ I = M + 1 IC ≥ 0 para J = M + 1 ,..., n - 1 km ≤ (n - m - 1) cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n pj = m+i - 1 j = m+1 cj+(n - m - i) cm+i ≤ m para i =2 ,..., n - m - 1 km ≤ n pj = n - 1 j = m+1 cj ≤ m 6. Resultados numéricos para valores seleccionados de N y M, resolvimos el programa lineal utilizando GLPK (Kit de programación lineal GNU). En la tabla a continuación, presentamos los resultados para una sola unidad (M = 1). Presentamos 1-K (el porcentaje del pago total de VCG que no se redistribuye por el peor mecanismo óptimo en el peor de los casos) en lugar de K en la segunda columna porque la escritura K requeriría demasiados dígitos significativos. En consecuencia, la tercera columna muestra el porcentaje 5 10 15 20 25 30 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Número de agentes Worst - Casado Centimiento 1 Unidad WO 1 Unidad BC 2 UNITS WO 2 UNITS BC 3 UNIDAD4 unidades BC Figura 1: Una comparación del peor mecanismo óptimo (WO) y el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo (BC).del pago total de VCG que no es redistribuido por el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo en el peor de los casos (que es igual a 2 N).N 1 - K Bailey - Cavallo Mecanismo 3 66.7% 66.7% 4 42.9% 50.0% 5 26.7% 40.0% 6 16.1% 33.3% 7 9.52% 28.6% 8 5.51% 25.0% 9 3.14% 22.2% 10 1.76% 20.0% 20 3.6222E-5 10.0% 30 5.40e-8 6.67e-2 40 7.09e-11 5.00E-2 El mejor mecanismo óptimo supera significativamente el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo en el peor de los peores. Quizás más sorprendentemente, el peor mecanismo óptimo de casos a veces es mejor en el peor de los casos que el mecanismo de Baileycavallo en promedio, como muestra el siguiente ejemplo. Recuerde que el pago de redistribución total del mecanismo de Baileycavallo es (m + 1) m n ˆvm + 2 + (n - m - 1) m n ˆvm + 1. Para el caso de una sola unidad, esto se simplifica a 2 n ˆv3 + n-2 n ˆv2. Por lo tanto, el porcentaje del pago VCG total que no se redistribuye es ˆV2− 2 N ˆv3− n - 2 n ˆv2 ˆv2 = 2 n - 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2, que tiene un valor esperado de e (2 n - 2 n ˆv3 ˆv2)= 2 n - 2 n e ˆv3 ˆv2. Supongamos que los valores de BID se extraen de una distribución uniforme sobre [0, 1]. La teoría de las estadísticas de orden nos dice que la función de densidad de probabilidad conjunta 34 de ˆv2 y ˆv3 es f (ˆv3, ˆv2) = n (n - 1) (n - 2) ˆvn - 3 3 (1 - ˆv2) para ˆv2 ≥ ˆv3. Ahora, E ˆV3 ˆV2 = R 1 0 R ˆV2 0 ˆV3 ˆV2 F (ˆV3, ˆV2) dˆv3dˆv2 = n --2 n - 1. Entonces, el valor esperado del porcentaje restante es 2 N - 2 N N - 2 N - 1 = 2 N (N - 1). Para n = 20, esto es 5.26E-3, mientras que el porcentaje restante para el peor mecanismo óptimo es 3.62E-5 en el peor de los casos. Presentemos la solución óptima para el caso n = 5 en detalle. Al resolver el programa lineal anterior, encontramos que los valores óptimos para el CI son C2 = 11 45, C3 = −1 9 y C4 = 1 15. Es decir, el pago de redistribución recibido por cada agente es: 11 45 veces la segunda oferta más alta entre los otros agentes, menos 1 9 veces la tercera oferta más alta entre los otros agentes, más 1 15 veces la cuarta oferta más alta entre los otros agentes. La cantidad total redistribuida es 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 - 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5;En el peor de los casos, se redistribuye 11 15 ˆv2. Por lo tanto, el porcentaje del pago total de VCG que no se redistribuye nunca es más de 4 15 = 26.7%. Finalmente, comparamos el mejor mecanismo óptimo con el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo para M = 1, 2, 3, 4, N = M + 2 ,..., 30. Estos resultados están en la Figura 1. Vemos que para cualquier m, cuando n = m + 2, el peor mecanismo óptimo tiene el mismo rendimiento del peor de los casos que el mecanismo Bailey-cavallo (en realidad, en este caso, el peor mecanismo óptimo es idéntico alMecanismo de Baileycavallo). Cuando n> m + 2, el peor mecanismo óptimo supera al mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo (en el peor de los casos).7. Caracterización analítica del peor mecanismo óptimo, recordamos que nuestro programa lineal tiene la siguiente forma: Variables: CM+1, CM+2 ,..., Cn - 1, k maximizar k (el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos) sujeto a: PJ I = M + 1 IC ≥ 0 para J = M + 1 ,..., n - 1 km ≤ (n - m - 1) cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n pj = m+i - 1 j = m+1 cj+(n - m - i) cm+i ≤ m para i =2 ,..., n - m - 1 km ≤ n pj = n - 1 j = m+1 cj ≤ m Un programa lineal no tiene ninguna solución si y solo si el objetivo es ilimitado o las restricciones son contradictorias (no hay una solución factible). Es fácil ver que K está limitado por encima de 1 (redistribuir más del 100% viola la restricción no déficit). Además, siempre existe una solución factible, por ejemplo, k = 0 y CI = 0 para todo i. Por lo tanto, siempre existe una solución óptima. Observe que el modelo de programa lineal depende solo del número de agentes n y el número de unidades m.Por lo tanto, la solución óptima es una función de N y M.Resulta que esta solución óptima se puede caracterizar analíticamente de la siguiente manera. Teorema 1. Para cualquier M y N con n ≥ m+2, el mecanismo óptimo del peorcoque (entre los mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales) es único. Para este mecanismo, el porcentaje redistribuido en el peor de los casos es k ∗ = 1-`n-1 m ´ pn-1 j = m` n-1 j ´ el peor mecanismo óptimo se caracteriza por los siguientes valores para el CI: c ∗ i = (−1) i+m - 1 (n - m) `n - 1 m - 1 ´ i pn - 1 j = m` n - 1 j ´ 1 `n - 1 i ´ n - 1xJ = I N - 1 J!para i = m + 1 ,..., n - 1. Cabe señalar que hemos demostrado CI = 0 para i ≤ m en la reclamación 1. Prueba. Primero reescribimos el programa lineal de la siguiente manera. Introducimos nuevas variables xm+1, xm+2 ,..., xn - 1, definido por xj = pj i = m + 1 ci para j = m + 1 ,..., n - 1. El programa lineal se convierte en: Variables: XM+1, XM+2 ,..., xn - 1, k maximice k sujeto a: km ≤ (n - m - 1) xm+1 ≤ m km ≤ (m+i) xm+i - 1+(n - m - i) xm+i ≤ mpara i = 2 ,..., n - m - 1 km ≤ nxn - 1 ≤ m xi ≥ 0 para i = m + 1, m + 2 ,..., n - 1 demostraremos que para cualquier solución óptima a este programa lineal, k = k ∗. Además, demostraremos que cuando k = k ∗, xj = pj i = m + 1 c ∗ i para j = m + 1 ,..., n - 1. Esto demostrará el teorema. Primero hacemos las siguientes observaciones: (n - m - 1) c ∗ m+1 = (n - m - 1) (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) (m+1) pn - 1 j =m (n - 1 j) 1 (n - 1 m+1) pn - 1 j = m+1 `n - 1 j ´ = (n - m - 1) (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) (M+1) Pn - 1 J = M (N - 1 J) 1 (N - 1 M+1) (Pn - 1 J = M `N - 1 J ´ -` N - 1 M ´) = ((N - M - 1) M N - M - 1 - (N - M - 1) M (N - 1 M) (N - M - 1) Pn - 1 J = M (N - 1 J) = M - (1- k ∗) m = k ∗ m para i = m + 1 ,..., n - 2, ic ∗ i+(n - i - 1) c ∗ i+1 = i (−1) i+m - 1 (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) i pn - 1 j= m (n - 1 j) 1 (n - 1 i) pn - 1 j = i `n - 1 j ´ + (n - i - 1) (−1) i + m (n - m) (n−1 m - 1) (i+1) pn - 1 j = m (n - 1 j) 1 (n - 1 i+1) pn - 1 j = i+1 `n - 1 j ´ = (−1)i+m - 1 (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) pn - 1 j = m (n - 1 j) 1 (n - 1 i) pn - 1 j = i `n - 1 j ´ - -(n - i - 1) (−1) i+m - 1 (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) (i+1) pn - 1 j = m (n - 1 j) i+1 (n - 1 i) (n - i - 1) pn - 1 j = i+1 `n - 1 j ´ = (−1) i+m - 1 (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) PN−1 j = m (n - 1 j) = (−1) i+m - 1 m (1 - k ∗) finalmente, (n - 1) c ∗ n - 1 = (n - 1) (−1)n+m (n - m) (n - 1 m - 1) (n - 1) pn - 1 j = m (n - 1 j) 1 (n - 1 n - 1) pn - 1 j = n - 1`n - 1 j ´ = (−1) m+n m (1 - k ∗) resumiendo lo anterior, tenemos: (n - m - 1) c ∗ m+1 = k ∗ m (m+1) c ∗m+1+(n - m - 2) c ∗ m+2 = m (1 - k ∗) (m+2) c ∗ m+2+(n - m - 3) c ∗ m+3 = −m(1 - k ∗) (m + 3) c ∗ m + 3 + (n - m - 4) c ∗ m + 4 = m (1 - k ∗) ... 35 (n - 3) c ∗ n−3 + 2c ∗ n - 2 = (−1) m + n - 2 m (1 - k ∗) (n - 2) c ∗ n - 2 + c ∗ n - 1 = (−1) m + n - 1m (1 - k ∗) (n - 1) c ∗ n - 1 = (−1) m+n m (1 - k ∗) Sea x ∗ j = pj i = m+1 c ∗ i para j = m+1, m + 2 ,..., n - 1, la primera ecuación en la anterior nos dice que (n - m - 1) x ∗ m+1 = k ∗ m.Al agregar las dos primeras ecuaciones, obtenemos (m + 2) x ∗ m + 1 + (n - m - 2) x ∗ m + 2 = m agregando las tres primeras ecuaciones, obtenemos (m + 3) x ∗m+2+(n - m - 3) x ∗ m+3 = k ∗ m agregando las primeras ecuaciones I, donde i = 2 ,..., n - m - 1, obtenemos (m + i) x ∗ m + i - 1 + (n - m - i) x ∗ m + i = m si i es par (m + i) x ∗ m + i−1 + (n - m - i) x ∗ m + i = k ∗ m Si i es impar finalmente al agregar todas las ecuaciones, obtenemos nx ∗ n - 1 si n - m es par;nx ∗ n - 1 = k ∗ m si n - m es impar. Por lo tanto, para todas las restricciones que no sean las restricciones de no negatividad, hemos demostrado que se satisfacen estableciendo xj = x ∗ j = pj i = m+1 c ∗ i y k = k ∗. A continuación, mostramos que las limitaciones de no negatividad también están satisfechas por estas configuraciones. Para m + 1 ≤ i, i + 1 ≤ n - 1, tenemos 1 i pn - 1 j = i (n - 1 j) (n - 1 i) = 1 i pn - 1 j = i i! (N−1 - i)!J! (N - 1 - J)!≥ 1 i+1 pn - 2 j = i i! (N - 1 - i)!J! (N - 1 - J)!≥ 1 i+1 pn - 2 j = i (i+1)! (N - 1 - i - 1)!(J+1)! (N - 1 - J - 1)!= 1 i+1 pn - 1 j = i+1 (n - 1 j) (n - 1 i+1) Esto implica que el valor absoluto de c ∗ i está disminuyendo a medida que aumenta (si el c ∗ contiene más deun número). Observamos además que el signo de C ∗ i alterna, con el primer elemento C ∗ m+1 positivo. Entonces x ∗ j = pj i = m+1 c ∗ i ≥ 0 para todos j. Por lo tanto, hemos demostrado que estos xi = x ∗ i junto con k = k ∗ forman una solución factible del programa lineal. Procedemos a mostrar que, de hecho, es la solución óptima única. Primero probamos el siguiente reclamo: Reclamación 4. Si ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2 ,..., N - 1 satisface las siguientes desigualdades: ˆkm ≤ (n - m - 1) ˆxm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m+i) ˆxmm+i - 1+(n - m - i) ˆxm+i ≤ m para i= 2 ,..., n - m - 1 ˆkm ≤ nˆxn - 1 ≤ m ˆk ≥ k ∗ entonces debemos tener que ˆxi = ˆx ∗ i y ˆk = k ∗. Prueba de reclamo. Considere la primera desigualdad. Sabemos que (n - m - 1) x ∗ m+1 = k ∗ m, entonces (n - m - 1) ˆxm+1 ≥ ˆkm ≥ k ∗ m = (n - m - 1) x ∗ m+1. Se deduce que ˆxm+1 ≥ x ∗ m+1 (n - m - 1 = 0). Ahora, considere la próxima desigualdad para i = 2. Sabemos que (m + 2) x ∗ m + 1 + (n - m - 2) x ∗ m + 2 = m.Se deduce que (n - m - 2) ˆxm+2 ≤ m− (m+2) ˆxm+1 ≤ m− (m+2) x ∗ m+1 = (n - m - 2) x ∗ m+2, entonces ˆxm+2 ≤ x ∗ m+2 (i = 2 ≤ n - m - 1 ⇒ n - m - 2 = 0). Ahora considere la próxima desigualdad para i = 3. Sabemos que (m + 3) x ∗ m + 2 + (n - m - 3) x ∗ m + 3 = m.Se deduce que (n - m - 3) ˆxm+3 ≥ ˆkm− (m+3) ˆxm+2 ≥ k ∗ m− (m+3) x ∗ m+2 = (n - m - 3) x ∗ m+3, entonces ˆxm+3 ≥ x ∗ m+3 (i = 3 ≤ n - m - 1 ⇒ n - m - 3 = 0). Procediendo así hasta este camino hasta i = n - m - 1, obtenemos que ˆxm+i ≥ x ∗ m+i si i es impar y ˆxm+i ≤ x ∗ m+i si es par. Además, si una desigualdad es estricta, entonces todas las desigualdades posteriores son estrictas. Ahora, si podemos probar ˆxn - 1 = x ∗ n - 1, seguiría que el x ∗ i es igual al ˆxi (lo que también implica que ˆk = k ∗). Consideramos dos casos: el caso 1: n - m es par. Tenemos: n - m incluso ⇒ n - m - 1 impar ⇒ ˆxn - 1 ≥ x ∗ n - 1. También tenemos: n - m incluso ⇒ nx ∗ n - 1 = m.Combinando estos dos, obtenemos m = nx ∗ n - 1 ≤ nˆxn - 1 ≤ m ⇒ ˆxn - 1 = x ∗ n - 1. Caso 2: N - M es impar. En este caso, tenemos ˆxn - 1 ≤ x ∗ n - 1, y nx ∗ n - 1 = k ∗ m.Luego, tenemos: k ∗ m ≤ ˆkm ≤ nˆxn - 1 ≤ nx ∗ n - 1 = k ∗ m ⇒ ˆxn - 1 = x ∗ n - 1. Esto completa la prueba del reclamo. Se deduce que si ˆk, ˆxi, i = m + 1, m + 2 ,..., N - 1 es una solución factible y ˆk ≥ k ∗, luego, dado que todas las desigualdades en el reclamo 4 están satisfechas, debemos tener ˆxi = x ∗ i y ˆk = k ∗. Por lo tanto, ninguna otra solución factible es tan buena como la descrita en el teorema. Conocer la caracterización analítica del peor mecanismo óptimo nos proporciona al menos dos beneficios importantes. Primero, el uso de estas fórmulas es computacionalmente más eficiente que resolver el programa lineal utilizando un solucionador GeneralPurpose. En segundo lugar, podemos derivar el siguiente corolario. Corolario 1. Si el número de unidades M se fija, entonces a medida que aumenta el número de agentes n, el porcentaje de peor casco redistribuido converge linealmente a 1, con una tasa de convergencia 1 2.(Es decir, limn → ∞ 1 - k ∗ n+1 1 - k ∗ n = 1 2. Es decir, en el límite, el porcentaje que no se redistribuye en las mitades para cada agente adicional). Observamos que esto es consistente con los datos experimentales para el caso de una sola unidad, donde el porcentaje restante del peor de los casos se mitadan aproximadamente cada vez que agregamos otro agente. El peor porcentaje de casos que se redistribuye bajo el mecanismo de Bailey-Cavallo también converge a 1 ya que el número de agentes va al infinito, pero la convergencia es mucho más lenta, no converge linealmente (es decir, permitiendo que KC N sea el porcentaje redistribuidoPor el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo en el peor de los agentes de N, Limn → ∞ 1-kc n+1 1-kc n = limn → ∞ n n+1 = 1). Ahora presentamos la prueba del corolario. Prueba. Cuando el número de agentes es N, el porcentaje de peor caso redistribuido es k ∗ n = 1-(n-1 m) pn-1 j = m (n-1 j). Cuando el número de agentes es n + 1, el porcentaje se convierte en k ∗ n + 1 = 1 - (n m) pn j = m (n j). Para n suficientemente grande, tendremos 2n - mnm - 1> 0 y, por lo tanto, 1 - k ∗ n+1 1 - k ∗ n = (n m) pn - 1 j = m (n - 1 j) (n - 1m) pn j = m (n j) = n n - m 2n - 1 - pm - 1 j = 0 (n - 1 j) 2n− pm - 1 j = 0 (n j), y n n - m 2n - 1 −m(n - 1) m - 1 2n ≤ 1 - k ∗ n+1 1 - k ∗ n ≤ n n - m 2n - 1 2n - mnm - 1 (porque `n j ´ ≤ ni si j ≤ i). Dado que tenemos limn → ∞ n n n - m 2n - 1 −m (n - 1) m - 1 2n = 1 2, y limn → ∞ n n - m 2n - 1 2n - mnm - 1 = 1 2, se deduce que Limn→ ∞ 1 - k ∗ n+1 1 - k ∗ n = 1 2.36 8. La optimización del peor de los casos fuera de la familia en esta sección, demostramos que el peor mecanismo de redistribución óptimo entre los mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales es de hecho óptimo (en el peor de los casos) entre todos los mecanismos de redistribución que son deterministas, anónimos, a prueba de estrategias,eficiente y satisfacer la restricción no déficit. Por lo tanto, restringir nuestra atención a los mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales no se perdió. Para probar este teorema, necesitamos el siguiente lema. Este lema no es nuevo: fue declarado informalmente por Cavallo [3]. Para completar, lo presentamos aquí con una prueba detallada. Lema 2. Un mecanismo de redistribución de VCG es determinista, anónimo y a prueba de estrategias si y solo si existe una función f: rn-1 → r, de modo que el pago de redistribución zi recibido por ai satisface zi = f (ˆv1, ˆv2, .., ...ˆVi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) para todos los vectores I y todos los vectores de oferta. Prueba. Primero, demostremos la única dirección if, es decir, si un mecanismo de redistribución de VCG es determinista, anónimo y a prueba de estrategias, entonces existe una función determinista F: Rn-1 → R, que hace zi = f (ˆv1, ˆv2,.., ˆVi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) para todos los vectores de I y todos los vectores de oferta. Si un mecanismo de redistribución de VCG es determinista y anónimo, entonces para cualquier vector de oferta ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥...≥ ˆvn, el mecanismo genera una lista de pago de redistribución única: Z1, Z2 ,..., Zn. Sea G: Rn → Rn la función que mapea ˆv1, ˆv2 ,..., ˆVn a Z1, Z2 ,..., Zn para todos los vectores de ofertas. Sea h (i, x1, x2, ..., xn) el elemento ésimo de g (x1, x2, ..., xn), de modo que zi = h (i, ˆv1, ˆv2, .., ˆvn) para todos los vectores de oferta y todos 1 ≤ i ≤ n.Debido a que el mecanismo es anónimo, dos agentes deben recibir el mismo pago de redistribución si sus ofertas son las mismas. Entonces, si ˆvi = ˆvj, H (i, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn) = H (j, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn). Por lo tanto, si dejamos j = min {t | ˆvt = ˆvi}, entonces h (i, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn) = h (j, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn). Definamos k: rn → n × rn de la siguiente manera: k (y, x1, x2, ..., xn - 1) = [j, w1, w2 ,..., wn], donde w1, w2 ,..., wn son y, x1, x2 ,..., xn - 1 ordenado en orden descendente, y j = min {t | wt = y}.({t | wt = y} = ∅ porque y ∈ {w1, w2, ..., wn}). También definamos f: rn → r por f (ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) = h ◦ k (ˆvi, ˆv1, ˆv2, .. .. ..., ˆVi - 1, ˆVi+1, ..., ˆvn) = h (min {t | ˆvt = ˆvi}, ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆVn) = h (i, ˆv1, ˆv2, ...ˆVn) = Zi. Es decir, F es el pago de redistribución a un agente que ofrece ˆvi cuando las otras ofertas son ˆv1, ˆv2 ,..., ˆVi - 1, ˆVi+1 ,..., ˆVn. Dado que nuestro mecanismo se requiere para ser a prueba de estrategias, y el espacio de las valoraciones no tiene restricciones, Zi debe ser independiente de ˆVi por Lemma 1 en Cavallo [3]. Por lo tanto, simplemente podemos ignorar la primera entrada variable a F;Sea f (x1, x2, ..., xn - 1) = f (0, x1, x2, ..., xn - 1). Entonces, tenemos para todos los vectores BID e I, Zi = F (ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆVi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn). Esto completa la prueba de la única dirección IF. Para la dirección if, si el pago de redistribución recibido por ai satisface zi = f (ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) para todos los vectores de oferta e i, entonces esto es claramenteun mecanismo determinista y anónimo. Para demostrar a prueba de la estrategia, observamos que debido a que el pago de la redistribución de los agentes no se ve afectado por su propia oferta, sus incentivos son los mismos que en el mecanismo VCG, que es a prueba de estrategias. Ahora estamos listos para presentar el próximo teorema: Teorema 2. Para cualquier M y N con n ≥ m+2, el mecanismo óptimo del peor de los casos entre la familia de mecanismos de redistribución de VCG lineales es el peor de los casos entre todos los mecanismos que son deterministas, anónimos, a prueba de estrategias, eficientes y satisfacen la restricción no débil.. Si bien necesitábamos racionalidad individual antes en el documento, este teorema no lo menciona, es decir, no podemos encontrar un mecanismo con un mejor rendimiento en el peor de los casos, incluso si sacrificamos la racionalidad individual.(El peor mecanismo óptimo de redistribución de VCG lineal óptimo es, por supuesto, individualmente racional). Prueba. Supongamos que hay un mecanismo de redistribución (cuando el número de unidades es M y el número de agentes es n) que satisface todas las propiedades anteriores y tiene un mejor rendimiento del peor de los casos que el peor mecanismo de redistribución de VCG lineal óptimo, es decir, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es, es.El porcentaje de redistribución del peor de los casos ˆk es estrictamente mayor que K ∗. Por Lemma 2, para este mecanismo, hay una función F: Rn - 1 → R de modo que zi = f (ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) para todos iy todos los vectores de oferta. Primero demostramos que F tiene las siguientes propiedades. Reclamación 5. f (1, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0) = 0 Si el número de 1 es menor o igual a m.Prueba de reclamo. Asumimos que para este mecanismo, el porcentaje de redistribución del peor de los casos satisface ˆk> k ∗ ≥ 0. Si el pago total de VCG es x, el pago de redistribución total debe estar en [ˆkx, x] (criterio no débil). Considere el caso en el que todos los agentes ofertan 0, de modo que el pago total de VCG también sea 0. Por lo tanto, el pago de redistribución total debe estar en [ˆk · 0, 0], es decir, debe ser 0. Por lo tanto, todos los agentes redistribución del pago F (0, 0, ..., 0) deben ser 0. Ahora, deje que ti = f (1, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0) donde el número de 1 es igual a i. Probamos T0 = 0. Si tn - 1 = 0, considere el vector de oferta donde todos ofertan 1. El pago total de VCG es M y el pago de redistribución total es NF (1, 1, ..., 1) = NTN - 1 = 0. Esto corresponde a una redistribución del 0%, lo cual es contrario a nuestra suposición de que ˆk> k ∗ ≥ 0. Ahora, considere j = min {i | ti = 0} (que está bien definido porque tn-1 = 0). Si j> m, la propiedad está satisfecha. Si j ≤ m, considere el vector de oferta donde ˆvi = 1 para i ≤ j y ˆvi = 0 para todos los demás i. Según este vector de oferta, los primeros agentes J obtienen cada uno el pago de redistribución tj - 1 = 0, y los agentes n - j restantes obtienen cada uno TJ. Por lo tanto, el pago de redistribución total es (N - J) TJ. Debido a que el pago total de VCG para este vector de oferta es 0, debemos tener (n - j) tj = 0. Entonces tj = 0 (j ≤ m <n). Pero esto es contrario a la definición de j. Por lo tanto, f (1, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0) = 0 si el número de 1 es menor o igual a m.Reclamación 6. F satisface las siguientes desigualdades: ˆkm ≤ (n - m - 1) tm+1 ≤ m ˆkm ≤ (m+i) tm+i - 1+(n - m - i) tm+i ≤ m para i= 2, 3 ,..., n - m - 1 ˆkm ≤ ntn - 1 ≤ m Aquí Ti se define como en la prueba de reclamo 5. 37 Prueba de reclamo. Para j = m + 1 ,..., n, considere los vectores de oferta donde ˆvi = 1 para i ≤ j y ˆvi = 0 para todos los demás i. Estos vectores de oferta junto con la restricción no déficit y la restricción del peor de los casos producen el conjunto de desigualdades anteriores: por ejemplo, cuando j = m + 1, consideramos el vector de oferta ˆvi = 1 para i ≤ m + 1 y ˆvi = 0para todos los demás i. Los primeros agentes M+1 reciben un pago de redistribución de tm = 0, y todos los demás agentes reciben tm+1. Por lo tanto, la redistribución total de VCG es (n - m - 1) tm+1. La restricción no porficiente proporciona (n - m - 1) tm+1 ≤ m (porque el pago total de VCG es m). La restricción del peor de los casos da (n-m-1) tm+1 ≥ ˆkm. Combinando estos dos, obtenemos la primera desigualdad. Las otras desigualdades se pueden obtener de la misma manera. Ahora observamos que las desigualdades en la reivindicación 6, junto con ˆk ≥ k ∗, son las mismas que las de la afirmación 4 (donde los Ti son reemplazados por el ˆxi). Por lo tanto, podemos concluir que ˆk = k ∗, que es contrario a nuestra suposición ˆk> k ∗. Por lo tanto, ningún mecanismo que satisfaga todas las propiedades enumeradas tiene un porcentaje de redistribución mayor que K ∗ en el peor de los casos. Hasta ahora solo hemos hablado sobre el caso donde n ≥ m+2. A los fines de la integridad, proporcionamos el siguiente reclamo para el caso n = m + 1. Reclamación 7. Para cualquier M y N con N = M + 1, el mecanismo VCG original (es decir, redistribuir nada) es (exclusivamente) lo peor óptimo entre todos los mecanismos de redistribución que son deterministas, anónimos, a prueba de estrategias, eficientes y satisfacen a los no-Vestricción del Deficit. Recordamos que cuando n = m+1, la afirmación 1 nos dice que el único mecanismo dentro de la familia de mecanismos de redistribución lineal es el mecanismo VCG original, por lo que este mecanismo es automáticamente el peor de los casos óptimo dentro de esta familia. Sin embargo, para probar la afirmación anterior, debemos demostrar que es el peor de los casos óptimo entre todos los mecanismos de redistribución que tienen las propiedades deseadas. Prueba. Supongamos que existe un mecanismo de redistribución que satisface todas las propiedades anteriores y tiene un rendimiento en el peor de los casos tan bueno como el mecanismo VCG original, es decir, su peor porcentaje de redistribución es mayor o igual a 0. Esto implica que el pago total de redistribución de este mecanismo siempre es no negativo. Por Lemma 2, para este mecanismo, hay una función F: Rn - 1 → R de modo que zi = f (ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvi - 1, ˆvi+1, ..., ˆvn) para todos iy todos los vectores de oferta. Probaremos que F (x1, x2, ..., xn - 1) = 0 para todos x1 ≥ x2 ≥...≥ xn - 1 ≥ 0. Primero, considere el vector de oferta donde ˆvi = 0 para todo i. Aquí, cada agente recibe un pago de redistribución f (0, 0, ..., 0). El pago de redistribución total es entonces NF (0, 0, ..., 0), que debe ser mayor o igual a 0 (por la observación anterior), así como menos o igual a 0 (usando el criterio no deficital y elhecho de que el pago total de VCG es 0). Se deduce que F (0, 0, ..., 0) = 0. Ahora, consideremos el vector de oferta donde ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 y ˆvi = 0 para todos los demás i. Para este vector de oferta, el agente con la oferta más alta recibe un pago de redistribución de F (0, 0, ..., 0) = 0, y los otros agentes n - 1 reciben F (x1, 0, ..,.,,.0). Por el mismo razonamiento que anteriormente, el pago de redistribución total debe ser mayor o igual a 0 y menor o igual a 0, por lo tanto F (x1, 0, ..., 0) = 0 para todos x1 ≥ 0. Procediendo por inducción, supongamos f (x1, x2, ..., xk, 0, ..., 0) = 0 para todos x1 ≥ x2 ≥...≥ xk ≥ 0, para algunos k <n - 1. Considere el vector de oferta donde ˆVi = xi para i ≤ k + 1, y ˆvi = 0 para todas las demás i, donde los Xi son números arbitrarios que satisfacen x1 ≥ x2 ≥...≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. Para los agentes con las ofertas más altas de K + 1, su pago de redistribución se especifica mediante F actuando en una entrada con solo k variables distintas de cero. Por lo tanto, todos reciben 0 por suposición de inducción. Los otros agentes n - k - 1 reciben cada uno F (x1, x2, ..., xk, xk+1, 0, ..., 0). El pago de redistribución total es entonces (n - k - 1) f (x1, x2, .., xk, xk+1, 0, .., 0), que debería ser mayor o igual a 0, ymenor o igual al pago total de VCG. Ahora, en este vector de oferta, la oferta más baja es 0 porque K + 1 <n.Pero como n = m + 1, el pago total de VCG es mˆvn = 0. Entonces tenemos f (x1, x2, ..., xk, xk+1, 0, ..., 0) = 0 para todos x1 ≥ x2 ≥...≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0. Por inducción, esta declaración es válida para todos los k <n - 1;Cuando k + 1 = n - 1, tenemos F (x1, x2, ..., xn - 2, xn - 1) = 0 para todos x1 ≥ x2 ≥...≥ xn - 2 ≥ xn - 1 ≥ 0. Por lo tanto, en este mecanismo, el pago de redistribución es siempre 0;Es decir, el mecanismo es solo el mecanismo VCG original. Por cierto, obtenemos el siguiente corolario: Corolario 2. Ningún mecanismo de redistribución de VCG satisface todo lo siguiente: determinismo, anonimato, a prueba de estrategias, eficiencia y equilibrio presupuestario (fuerte). Esto es válido para cualquier n ≥ m + 1. Prueba. Para el caso n ≥ m + 2: si tal mecanismo existe, su peor rendimiento sería mejor que el de los peores casos de redistribución de VCG lineal óptimo, que por el Teorema 1 obtiene un porcentaje de redistribución estrictamente menos de 1. Pero el Teorema 2 muestra que es imposible superar este mecanismo en el peor de los casos. Para el caso n = m + 1: si tal mecanismo existe, funcionaría tan bien como el mecanismo VCG original en el peor de los casos, lo que implica que es idéntico al mecanismo VCG por reclamo 7. Pero el mecanismo VCG no está (fuertemente) el presupuesto equilibrado.9. Conclusiones Para los problemas de asignación con uno o más elementos, el conocido mecanismo de Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) es eficiente, a prueba de estrategias, individualmente racional y no incurre en un déficit. Sin embargo, el mecanismo VCG no está (fuertemente) el presupuesto equilibrado: en general, los pagos de los agentes sumarán más de 0. Si hay un subastador que está vendiendo los artículos, esto puede ser deseable, porque el pago excedente corresponde a los ingresos para el subastador. Sin embargo, si los artículos no tienen un propietario y los agentes simplemente están interesados en asignar los artículos de manera eficiente entre ellos, cualquier pago excedente es indeseable, ya que tendrá que fluir del sistema de agentes. En 2006, Cavallo [3] propuso un mecanismo que redistribuye parte del pago de VCG a los agentes, al tiempo que mantiene la eficiencia, la resistencia a la estrategia, la racionalidad individual y la propiedad no déficit. En este artículo, ampliamos este resultado en una configuración restringida. Estudiamos configuraciones de asignación donde hay múltiples unidades indistinguibles de un solo bien, y los agentes tienen demanda de unidades.(Para este entorno específico, el mecanismo de Cavallos coincide con un mecanismo propuesto por Bailey en 1997 [2]. Aquí propusimos una familia de mecanismos que redistribuyen parte del pago VCG 38 a los agentes. Todos los mecanismos de la familia son eficientes, a prueba de estrategias, individualmente racionales y nunca incurren en un déficit. La familia incluye el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo como un caso especial. Luego proporcionamos un modelo de optimización para encontrar el mecanismo óptimo, es decir, el mecanismo que maximiza la redistribución en el peor de los casos en la familia, y mostró cómo lanzar este modelo como un programa lineal. Dimos soluciones numéricas y analíticas de este programa lineal, y el mecanismo (único) resultante muestra una mejora significativa sobre el mecanismo Bailey-Cavallo (en el peor de los casos). Finalmente, demostramos que el mecanismo obtenido es óptimo entre todos los mecanismos deterministas anónimos que satisfacen las propiedades anteriores. Una dirección importante para futuras investigaciones es tratar de extender estos resultados más allá de las subastas de unidades múltiples con la demanda de la unidad. Sin embargo, resulta que en entornos suficientemente generales, el peor porcentaje de redistribución óptima es 0. En tales entornos, el criterio del peor de los casos no proporciona orientación para determinar un buen mecanismo de redistribución (incluso redistribuir nada logra el porcentaje óptimo del peor de los casos), por lo que se hace necesario perseguir otros criterios. Alternativamente, uno puede intentar identificar otras configuraciones especiales en las que es posible la redistribución positiva en el peor de los casos. Otra dirección para futuras investigaciones es considerar si este mecanismo tiene aplicaciones para la colusión. Por ejemplo, en un esquema colusivo típico, hay un anillo de licitación que consta de una serie de coluders, que presentan solo una oferta [10, 17]. Si esta oferta gana, los Colluders deben asignar el artículo entre ellos, tal vez usando pagos, pero por supuesto que no quieren que los pagos fluyan fuera del ring. Este trabajo es parte de una creciente literatura sobre el diseño de mecanismos que obtienen buenos resultados en el peor de los casos. Tradicionalmente, los economistas se han centrado principalmente en el diseño de mecanismos que siempre obtienen ciertas propiedades (como el mecanismo VCG), o en el diseño de mecanismos que son óptimos con respecto a alguna distribución previa sobre las preferencias de los agentes (como la subasta Myerson [20] yLa subasta de Maskin-Riley [18] para maximizar los ingresos esperados). Algunos documentos más recientes se han centrado en diseñar mecanismos para la maximización de las ganancias utilizando un análisis competitivo en el peor de los casos (por ejemplo, [9, 1, 15, 8]). También ha habido un creciente interés en el diseño de mecanismos en línea [7] donde los agentes llegan con el tiempo y las decisiones deben tomarse antes de que todos los agentes hayan llegado. Tal trabajo a menudo también adopta un enfoque de análisis competitivo en el peor de los casos [14, 13]. No parece que haya conexiones directas entre nuestro trabajo y estos otros trabajos que se centran en el diseño de mecanismos que funcionan bien en el peor de los casos. Sin embargo, parece probable que la investigación futura continúe investigando el diseño del mecanismo para el peor de los casos, y es de esperar que surja un marco coherente.10. Referencias [1] G.

        "There exist ways of determining the payments that the agents make in such an auction that incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof.",
        "One very general way of doing so is to use the VCG mechanism [23, 4, 12]. (The VCG mechanism is also known as the Clarke mechanism or, in the specific context of auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction.)",
        "Besides strategy-proofness, the VCG mechanism has several other nice properties in the context of resource allocation problems.",
        "It is efficient: the chosen allocation always maximizes the sum of the agents valuations.",
        "It is also (expost) individually rational: participating in the mechanism never makes an agent worse off than not participating.",
        "Finally, it has a no-deficit property: the sum of the agents payments is always nonnegative.",

        "If the agents use an auction to allocate these resources, and the sum of the agents payments in the auction is positive, then this surplus payment must leave the system 30 of the agents (for example, the agents must give the money to an outside party, or burn it).",
        "Na¨ıve redistribution of the surplus payment (e.g. each of the n agents receives 1/n of the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not strategy-proof (e.g. in a Vickrey auction, the second-highest bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger redistribution payment).",
        "Unfortunately, the VCG mechanism is not budget balanced: typically, there is surplus payment.",

        "In light of this impossibility result, several authors have obtained budget balance by sacrificing some of the other desirable properties [2, 6, 22, 5].",
        "Another approach that is perhaps preferable is to use a mechanism that is more budget balanced than the VCG mechanism, and maintains all the other desirable properties.",

        "Both numerical and analytical solutions of this model are provided, and the resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the BaileyCavallo mechanism (in the worst case).",
        "For example, for the problem of allocating a single unit, when the number of agents is 10, our mechanism always redistributes more than 98% of the total VCG payment back to the agents (whereas the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism redistributes only 80% in the worst case).",
        "Finally, we prove that our mechanism is in fact optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms (even nonlinear ones) that satisfy the desirable properties.",
        "Around the same time, the same mechanism has been independently derived by Moulin [19].1 Moulin actually pursues a different objective (also based on worst-case analysis): whereas our objective is to maximize the percentage of VCG payments that are redistributed, Moulin tries to minimize the overall payments from agents as a percentage of efficiency.",
        "It turns out that the resulting mechanisms are the same.",
        "Towards the end of this paper, we consider dropping the individual rationality requirement, and show that this does not change the optimal mechanism for our objective.",

        "We only consider the case where m < n (otherwise the problem becomes trivial).",
        "We also assume that m and n are always known. (This assumption is not harmful: in environments where anyone can join the auction, running a redistribution mechanism is typically not a good idea anyway, because everyone would want to join to collect part of the redistribution.)",
        "Let the set of agents be {a1, a2, . . . , an}, where ai is the agent with ith highest report value ˆvi-that is, we have ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0.",

        "Given that the mechanism is strategy-proof, we can assume vi = ˆvi.",
        "Under the VCG mechanism, each agent among a1, . . . , am wins a unit, and pays ˆvm+1 for this unit.",

        "After running the original VCG mechanism, the center returns to each agent ai some amount zi, agent ais redistribution payment.",

        "LINEAR VCG REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS We are now ready to introduce the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms.",
        "Such a mechanism is defined by a vector of constants c0, c1, . . . , cn−1.",
        "The amount that the mechanism returns to agent ai is zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn.",

        "Hence, to obtain these properties, we need to place some constraints on the constants.",
        "To satisfy the individual rationality criterion, each agents utility should always be non-negative.",
        "An agent that does not win a unit obtains a utility that is equal to the agents redistribution payment.",

        "Consider agent an, the agent with the lowest bid.",
        "Since this agent does not win an item (m < n), her utility is just her redistribution payment zn.",

        "To satisfy the non-deficit criterion, the sum of the redistribution payments should be less than or equal to the total VCG payment.",

        "We define the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms to be the set of all redistribution mechanisms corresponding to constants ci that satisfy the above constraints (so that the mechanisms will be individually rational and have the no-deficit property).",

        "Example 1 (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism): Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n and ci = 0 for all other i.",
        "Under this mechanism, each agent receives a redistribution payment of m n times the (m+1)th highest bid from another agent.",
        "Hence, a1, . . . , am+1 receive a redistribution payment of m n ˆvm+2, and the others receive m n ˆvm+1.",
        "Thus, the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m− 1)m n ˆvm+1.",
        "This redistribution mechanism is individually rational, because all the redistribution payments are nonnegative, and never incurs a deficit, because (m + 1) m n ˆvm+2 + (n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1 ≤ nm n ˆvm+1 = mˆvm+1. (We note that for this mechanism to make sense, we need n ≥ m + 2.)",
        "Example 2: Consider the mechanism corresponding to cm+1 = m n−m−1 , cm+2 = − m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) , and ci = 0 for all other i.",
        "In this mechanism, each agent receives a redistribution payment of m n−m−1 times the (m + 1)th highest reported value from other agents, minus m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) times the (m+2)th highest reported value from other agents.",
        "Thus, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3.",
        "If n ≥ 2m+3 (which is equivalent to m n−m−1 ≥ m(m+1) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ), then each agent always receives a nonnegative redistribution payment, thus the mechanism is individually rational.",

        "Which of these two mechanisms is better?",
        "Is there another mechanism that is even better?",
        "This is what we study in the next section. 4.",
        "OPTIMAL REDISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS Among all linear VCG redistribution mechanisms, we would like to be able to identify the one that redistributes the greatest percentage of the total VCG payment.2 This is not a well-defined notion: it may be that one mechanism redistributes more on some bid vectors, and another more on other bid vectors.",
        "We emphasize that we do not assume that a prior distribution over bidders valuations is available, so we cannot compare them based on expected redistribution.",
        "Below, we study three well-defined ways of comparing redistribution mechanisms: best-case performance, dominance, and worst-case performance.",
        "Best-case performance.",
        "One way of evaluating a mechanism is by considering the highest redistribution percentage that it achieves.",
        "Consider the previous two examples.",
        "For the first example, the total redistribution payment is (m + 1)m n ˆvm+2 + (n − m − 1)m n ˆvm+1.",
        "When ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1, this is equal to the total VCG payment mˆvm+1.",
        "Thus, this mechanism redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case.",

        "When ˆvm+3 = 0, this is equal to the total VCG payment mˆvm+1.",
        "Thus, this mechanism also redistributes 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case.",
        "Moreover, there are actually infinitely many mechanisms that redistribute 100% of the total VCG payment in the best case-for example, any convex combination of the above two will redistribute 100% if both ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 and ˆvm+3 = 0.",
        "Dominance.",
        "Inside the family of linear VCG redistribution mechanisms, we say one mechanism dominates another mechanism if the first one redistributes at least as much as the other for any bid vector.",
        "For the previous two examples, neither dominates the other, because they each redistribute 100% in different cases.",
        "It turns out that there is no mechanism in the family that dominates all other mechanisms in the family.",
        "For suppose such a mechanism exists.",
        "Then, it should dominate both examples above.",
        "Consider the remaining VCG payment (the VCG payment failed to be redistributed).",
        "The remaining VCG payment of the dominant mechanism should be 0 whenever ˆvm+2 = ˆvm+1 or ˆvm+3 = 0.",
        "Now, the remaining VCG payment is a linear function of the ˆvi (linear redistribution), and therefore also a polynomial function.",
        "The above implies that this function can be written as (ˆvm+2 − ˆvm+1)(ˆvm+3)P(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvn), where P is a 2 The percentage redistributed seems the natural criterion to use, among other things because it is scale-invariant: if we multiply all bids by the same positive constant (for example, if we change the units by re-expressing the bids in euros instead of dollars), we would not want the behavior of our mechanism to change. 32 polynomial function.",
        "But since the function must be linear (has degree at most 1), it follows that P = 0.",
        "Thus, a dominant mechanism would always redistribute all of the VCG payment, which is not possible. (If it were possible, then our worst-case optimal redistribution mechanism would also always redistribute all of the VCG payment, and we will see later that it does not.)",
        "Worst-case performance.",
        "Finally, we can evaluate a mechanism by considering the lowest redistribution percentage that it guarantees.",
        "For the first example, the total redistribution payment is (m+1)m n ˆvm+2 +(n−m−1)m n ˆvm+1, which is greater than or equal to (n−m−1) m n ˆvm+1.",
        "So in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+2 = 0, the percentage redistributed is n−m−1 n .",
        "For the second example, the total redistribution payment is mˆvm+1 − m(m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ˆvm+3, which is greater than or equal to mˆvm+1(1− (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) ).",
        "So in the worst case, which is when ˆvm+3 = ˆvm+1, the percentage redistributed is 1 − (m+1)(m+2) (n−m−1)(n−m−2) .",
        "Since we assume that the number of agents n and the number of units m are known, we can determine which example mechanism has better worst-case performance by comparing the two quantities.",
        "When n = 6 and m = 1, for the first example (Bailey-Cavallo mechanism), the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 2 3 , and for the second example, this percentage is 1 2 , which implies that for this pair of n and m, the first mechanism has better worst-case performance.",
        "On the other hand, when n = 12 and m = 1, for the first example, the percentage redistributed in the worst case is 5 6 , and for the second example, this percentage is 14 15 , which implies that this time the second mechanism has better worst-case performance.",
        "Thus, it seems most natural to compare mechanisms by the percentage of total VCG payment that they redistribute in the worst case.",
        "This percentage is undefined when the total VCG payment is 0.",
        "To deal with this, technically, we define the worst-case redistribution percentage as the largest k so that the total amount redistributed is at least k times the total VCG payment, for all bid vectors. (Hence, as long as the total amount redistributed is at least 0 when the total VCG payment is 0, these cases do not affect the worst-case percentage.)",
        "This corresponds to the following optimization problem: Maximize k (the percentage redistributed in the worst case) Subject to: For every bid vector ˆv1 ≥ ˆv2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˆvn ≥ 0 zn ≥ 0 (individual rationality) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≤ mˆvm+1 (non-deficit) z1 + z2 + . . . + zn ≥ kmˆvm+1 (worst-case constraint) We recall that zi = c0 + c1ˆv1 + c2ˆv2 + . . . + ci−1ˆvi−1 + ciˆvi+1 + . . . + cn−1ˆvn. 5.",

        "For n = 20, this is 5.26e − 3, whereas the remaining percentage for the worst-case optimal mechanism is 3.62e−5 in the worst case.",
        "Let us present the optimal solution for the case n = 5 in detail.",
        "By solving the above linear program, we find that the optimal values for the ci are c2 = 11 45 , c3 = −1 9 , and c4 = 1 15 .",
        "That is, the redistribution payment received by each agent is: 11 45 times the second highest bid among the other agents, minus 1 9 times the third highest bid among the other agents, plus 1 15 times the fourth highest bid among the other agents.",
        "The total amount redistributed is 11 15 ˆv2 + 4 15 ˆv3 − 4 15 ˆv4 + 4 15 ˆv5; in the worst case, 11 15 ˆv2 is redistributed.",
        "Hence, the percentage of the total VCG payment that is not redistributed is never more than 4 15 = 26.7%.",

        "These results are in Figure 1.",
        "We see that for any m, when n = m + 2, the worst-case optimal mechanism has the same worst-case performance as the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (actually, in this case, the worst-case optimal mechanism is identical to the BaileyCavallo mechanism).",

        "ANALYTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE WORST-CASE OPTIMAL MECHANISM We recall that our linear program has the following form: Variables: cm+1, cm+2, . . . , cn−1, k Maximize k (the percentage redistributed in the worst case) Subject to:Pj i=m+1 ci ≥ 0 for j = m + 1, . . . , n − 1 km ≤ (n − m − 1)cm+1 ≤ m km ≤ n Pj=m+i−1 j=m+1 cj + (n − m − i)cm+i ≤ m for i = 2, . . . , n − m − 1 km ≤ n Pj=n−1 j=m+1 cj ≤ m A linear program has no solution if and only if either the objective is unbounded, or the constraints are contradictory (there is no feasible solution).",
        "It is easy to see that k is bounded above by 1 (redistributing more than 100% violates the non-deficit constraint).",
        "Also, a feasible solution always exists, for example, k = 0 and ci = 0 for all i.",
        "So an optimal solution always exists.",
        "Observe that the linear program model depends only on the number of agents n and the number of units m. Hence the optimal solution is a function of n and m. It turns out that this optimal solution can be analytically characterized as follows.",

        "This completes the proof of the claim.",

        "That is, in the limit, the percentage that is not redistributed halves for every additional agent.)",

        "Let us define K : Rn → N × Rn as follows: K(y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = [j, w1, w2, . . . , wn], where w1, w2, . . . , wn are y, x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 sorted in descending order, and j = min{t|wt = y}. ({t|wt = y} = ∅ because y ∈ {w1, w2, . . . , wn}).",

        "This corresponds to 0% redistribution, which is contrary to our assumption that ˆk > k∗ ≥ 0.",

        "The first m+1 agents each receive a redistribution payment of tm = 0, and all other agents each receive tm+1.",

        "However, to prove the above claim, we need to show that it is worst-case optimal among all redistribution mechanisms that have the desired properties.",
        "Proof.",
        "Suppose a redistribution mechanism exists that satisfies all of the above properties and has a worst-case performance as good as the original VCG mechanism, that is, its worst-case redistribution percentage is greater than or equal to 0.",
        "This implies that the total redistribution payment of this mechanism is always nonnegative.",
        "By Lemma 2, for this mechanism, there is a function f : Rn−1 → R so that zi = f(ˆv1, ˆv2, . . . , ˆvi−1, ˆvi+1, . . . , ˆvn) for all i and all bid vectors.",
        "We will prove that f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0.",
        "First, consider the bid vector where ˆvi = 0 for all i.",
        "Here, each agent receives a redistribution payment f(0, 0, . . . , 0).",
        "The total redistribution payment is then nf(0, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0 (by the above observation) as well less than or equal to 0 (using the nondeficit criterion and the fact that the total VCG payment is 0).",
        "It follows that f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0.",
        "Now, let us consider the bid vector where ˆv1 = x1 ≥ 0 and ˆvi = 0 for all other i.",
        "For this bid vector, the agent with the highest bid receives a redistribution payment of f(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, and the other n − 1 agents each receive f(x1, 0, . . . , 0).",
        "By the same reasoning as above, the total redistribution payment should be both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0, hence f(x1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ 0.",
        "Proceeding by induction, let us assume f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ 0, for some k < n − 1.",
        "Consider the bid vector where ˆvi = xi for i ≤ k + 1, and ˆvi = 0 for all other i, where the xi are arbitrary numbers satisfying x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0.",
        "For the agents with the highest k + 1 bids, their redistribution payment is specified by f acting on an input with only k non-zero variables.",
        "Hence they all receive 0 by induction assumption.",
        "The other n − k − 1 agents each receive f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0).",
        "The total redistribution payment is then (n−k−1)f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0), which should be both greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to the total VCG payment.",
        "Now, in this bid vector, the lowest bid is 0 because k + 1 < n. But since n = m + 1, the total VCG payment is mˆvn = 0.",
        "So we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xk, xk+1, 0, . . . , 0) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xk ≥ xk+1 ≥ 0.",
        "By induction, this statement holds for all k < n − 1; when k + 1 = n − 1, we have f(x1, x2, . . . , xn−2, xn−1) = 0 for all x1 ≥ x2 ≥ . . . ≥ xn−2 ≥ xn−1 ≥ 0.",
        "Hence, in this mechanism, the redistribution payment is always 0; that is, the mechanism is just the original VCG mechanism.",
        "Incidentally, we obtain the following corollary: Corollary 2.",
        "No VCG redistribution mechanism satisfies all of the following: determinism, anonymity, strategyproofness, efficiency, and (strong) budget balance.",
        "This holds for any n ≥ m + 1.",
        "Proof.",
        "For the case n ≥ m + 2: If such a mechanism exists, its worst-case performance would be better than that of the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism, which by Theorem 1 obtains a redistribution percentage strictly less than 1.",
        "But Theorem 2 shows that it is impossible to outperform this mechanism in the worst case.",
        "For the case n = m + 1: If such a mechanism exists, it would perform as well as the original VCG mechanism in the worst case, which implies that it is identical to the VCG mechanism by Claim 7.",
        "But the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced. 9.",
        "CONCLUSIONS For allocation problems with one or more items, the wellknown Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a deficit.",
        "However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents payments will sum to more than 0.",
        "If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer.",
        "However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.",
        "In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property.",
        "In this paper, we extended this result in a restricted setting.",
        "We studied allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].)",
        "Here we proposed a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment 38 back to the agents.",
        "All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit.",
        "The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case.",
        "We then provided an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear program.",
        "We gave both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case).",
        "Finally, we proved that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.",
        "One important direction for future research is to try to extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit demand.",
        "However, it turns out that in sufficiently general settings, the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage is 0.",
        "In such settings, the worst-case criterion provides no guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism (even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case percentage), so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria.",
        "Alternatively, one can try to identify other special settings in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible.",
        "Another direction for future research is to consider whether this mechanism has applications to collusion.",
        "For example, in a typical collusive scheme, there is a bidding ring consisting of a number of colluders, who submit only a single bid [10, 17].",
        "If this bid wins, the colluders must allocate the item amongst themselves, perhaps using payments-but of course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring.",
        "This work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case.",
        "Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).",
        "Some more recent papers have focused on designing mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive analysis (e.g. [9, 1, 15, 8]).",
        "There has also been growing interest in the design of online mechanisms [7] where the agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before all the agents have arrived.",
        "Such work often also takes a worst-case competitive analysis approach [14, 13].",
        "It does not appear that there are direct connections between our work and these other works that focus on designing mechanisms that perform well in the worst case.",
        "Nevertheless, it seems likely that future research will continue to investigate mechanism design for the worst case, and hopefully a coherent framework will emerge. 10.",

                "However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents payments will sum to more than 0.",
                "If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer.",
                "However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.",
                "In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property.",
                "In this paper, we extend this result in a restricted setting.",
                "We study allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].)",
                "Here we propose a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment back to the agents.",
                "All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategyproof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit.",
                "The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case.",
                "We then provide an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and show how to cast this model as a linear program.",
                "We give both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case).",
                "Finally, we prove that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics; I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Multiagent Systems General Terms Algorithms, Economics, Theory 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Many important problems in computer science and electronic commerce can be modeled as resource allocation problems.",
                "In such problems, we want to allocate the resources (or items) to the agents that value them the most.",
                "Unfortunately, agents valuations are private knowledge, and self-interested agents will lie about their valuations if this is to their benefit.",
                "One solution is to auction off the items, possibly in a combinatorial auction where agents can bid on bundles of items.",
                "There exist ways of determining the payments that the agents make in such an auction that incentivizes the agents to report their true valuations-that is, the payments make the auction strategy-proof.",
                "One very general way of doing so is to use the VCG mechanism [23, 4, 12]. (The VCG mechanism is also known as the Clarke mechanism or, in the specific context of auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction.)",
                "Besides strategy-proofness, the VCG mechanism has several other nice properties in the context of resource allocation problems.",
                "It is efficient: the chosen allocation always maximizes the sum of the agents valuations.",
                "It is also (expost) individually rational: participating in the mechanism never makes an agent worse off than not participating.",
                "Finally, it has a no-deficit property: the sum of the agents payments is always nonnegative.",
                "In many settings, another property that would be desirable is (strong) budget balance, meaning that the payments sum to exactly 0.",
                "Suppose the agents are trying to distribute some resources among themselves that do not have a previous owner.",
                "For example, the agents may be trying to allocate the right to use a shared good on a given day.",
                "Or, the agents may be trying to allocate a resource that they have collectively constructed, discovered, or otherwise obtained.",
                "If the agents use an auction to allocate these resources, and the sum of the agents payments in the auction is positive, then this surplus payment must leave the system 30 of the agents (for example, the agents must give the money to an outside party, or burn it).",
                "Na¨ıve redistribution of the surplus payment (e.g. each of the n agents receives 1/n of the surplus) will generally result in a mechanism that is not strategy-proof (e.g. in a Vickrey auction, the second-highest bidder would want to increase her bid to obtain a larger redistribution payment).",
                "Unfortunately, the VCG mechanism is not budget balanced: typically, there is surplus payment.",

                "However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.",

                "For the case n ≥ m + 2: If such a mechanism exists, its worst-case performance would be better than that of the worst-case optimal linear VCG redistribution mechanism, which by Theorem 1 obtains a redistribution percentage strictly less than 1.",
                "But Theorem 2 shows that it is impossible to outperform this mechanism in the worst case.",
                "For the case n = m + 1: If such a mechanism exists, it would perform as well as the original VCG mechanism in the worst case, which implies that it is identical to the VCG mechanism by Claim 7.",
                "But the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced. 9.",
                "CONCLUSIONS For allocation problems with one or more items, the wellknown Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and does not incur a deficit.",
                "However, the VCG mechanism is not (strongly) budget balanced: generally, the agents payments will sum to more than 0.",
                "If there is an auctioneer who is selling the items, this may be desirable, because the surplus payment corresponds to revenue for the auctioneer.",
                "However, if the items do not have an owner and the agents are merely interested in allocating the items efficiently among themselves, any surplus payment is undesirable, because it will have to flow out of the system of agents.",
                "In 2006, Cavallo [3] proposed a mechanism that redistributes some of the VCG payment back to the agents, while maintaining efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and the non-deficit property.",
                "In this paper, we extended this result in a restricted setting.",
                "We studied allocation settings where there are multiple indistinguishable units of a single good, and agents have unit demand. (For this specific setting, Cavallos mechanism coincides with a mechanism proposed by Bailey in 1997 [2].)",
                "Here we proposed a family of mechanisms that redistribute some of the VCG payment 38 back to the agents.",
                "All mechanisms in the family are efficient, strategy-proof, individually rational, and never incur a deficit.",
                "The family includes the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism as a special case.",
                "We then provided an optimization model for finding the optimal mechanism-that is, the mechanism that maximizes redistribution in the worst case-inside the family, and showed how to cast this model as a linear program.",
                "We gave both numerical and analytical solutions of this linear program, and the (unique) resulting mechanism shows significant improvement over the Bailey-Cavallo mechanism (in the worst case).",
                "Finally, we proved that the obtained mechanism is optimal among all anonymous deterministic mechanisms that satisfy the above properties.",
                "One important direction for future research is to try to extend these results beyond multi-unit auctions with unit demand.",
                "However, it turns out that in sufficiently general settings, the worst-case optimal redistribution percentage is 0.",
                "In such settings, the worst-case criterion provides no guidance in determining a good redistribution mechanism (even redistributing nothing achieves the optimal worst-case percentage), so it becomes necessary to pursue other criteria.",
                "Alternatively, one can try to identify other special settings in which positive redistribution in the worst case is possible.",
                "Another direction for future research is to consider whether this mechanism has applications to collusion.",
                "For example, in a typical collusive scheme, there is a bidding ring consisting of a number of colluders, who submit only a single bid [10, 17].",
                "If this bid wins, the colluders must allocate the item amongst themselves, perhaps using payments-but of course they do not want payments to flow out of the ring.",
                "This work is part of a growing literature on designing mechanisms that obtain good results in the worst case.",
                "Traditionally, economists have mostly focused either on designing mechanisms that always obtain certain properties (such as the VCG mechanism), or on designing mechanisms that are optimal with respect to some prior distribution over the agents preferences (such as the Myerson auction [20] and the Maskin-Riley auction [18] for maximizing expected revenue).",
                "Some more recent papers have focused on designing mechanisms for profit maximization using worst-case competitive analysis (e.g. [9, 1, 15, 8]).",
                "There has also been growing interest in the design of online mechanisms [7] where the agents arrive over time and decisions must be taken before all the agents have arrived.",
                "Such work often also takes a worst-case competitive analysis approach [14, 13].",
                "It does not appear that there are direct connections between our work and these other works that focus on designing mechanisms that perform well in the worst case.",
                "Nevertheless, it seems likely that future research will continue to investigate mechanism design for the worst case, and hopefully a coherent framework will emerge. 10.",
