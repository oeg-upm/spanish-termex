Nowadays there are dozens of academic and commercial products that allow execution of isolated tasks on grids, but few products support the enactment of long-running processes in a distributed fashion. In order to address such subject, this paper presents a programming model and an infrastructure that hierarchically schedules process activities using available nodes in a wide grid environment. Their advantages are automatic and structured distribution of activities and easy process monitoring and steering.

INTRODUCTION Grid computing is a model for wide-area distributed and parallel computing across heterogeneous networks in multiple administrative domains. This research field aims to promote sharing of resources and provides breakthrough computing power over this wide network of virtual organizations in a seamless manner [8]. Traditionally, as in Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10], there is a minimal infrastructure that provides data resource sharing, computational resource utilization management, and distributed execution. Specifically, considering distributed execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12]. This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery. There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid. In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies. Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks. However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13]. In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure. The programming model employs structured control flow to promote controlled and contextualized activity execution. Complementary, the support infrastructure, which executes a process specification, takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a specified process in order to distribute and schedule strong dependent activities as a unit, allowing a better execution performance and fault-tolerance and providing localized communication. The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled, structured and localized way. Next Section describes the programming model, and Section 3, the support infrastructure for the proposed grid computing model. Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities. Related works are presented and compared to the proposed model in Section 5. The last Section concludes this paper encompassing the advantages of the proposed hierarchical process execution support for the grid computing area and lists some future works. 87 Middleware 2004 Companion ProcessElement Process Activity Controller 1 * 1 * Figure 1: High-level framework of the programming model 2. PROGRAMMING MODEL The programming model designed for the grid computing architecture is very similar to the specified to the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) [2]. Both describe processes in XML [4] documents, but the former specifies processes strictly synchronous and structured, and has more constructs for structured parallel control. The rationale behind of its design is the possibility of hierarchically distribute the process control and coordination based on structured constructs, differently from BPEL, which does not allow hierarchical composition of processes. In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem. In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1). Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses. Like structured languages, controllers can be nested and then determine the execution order of other controllers. Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters. They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process. External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes. There are sequential and parallel controllers. The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while. The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs. Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile. They extend the respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements. All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish. Indeed, they contain a fork and a join of execution. Aiming to implement a conditional join, all parallel controller types contain an exit condition, evaluated all time that an element execution finishes, in order to determine when the controller must end. The parfor and parwhile are the iterative versions of the parallel controller types. Both fork executions while the iteration condition is true. This provides flexibility to determine, at run-time, the number of process elements to execute simultaneously. When compared to workflow languages, the parallel controller types represent structured versions of the workflow control constructors, because they can nest other controllers and also can express fixed and conditional forks and joins, present in such languages. 2.2 Process Example This section presents an example of a prime number search application that receives a certain range of integers and returns a set of primes contained in this range. The whole computation is made by a process, which uses a parallel controller to start and dispatch several concurrent activities of the same type, in order to find prime numbers. The portion of the XML document that describes the process and activity types is shown below. <PROCESS_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <BODY> <PRE_CODE> setPrimes(new RemoteHashSet()); parfor.setMin(getMin()); parfor.setMax(getMax()); parfor.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); parfor.setNumActs(getNumActs()); parfor.setPrimes(getPrimes()); parfor.setCounterBegin(0); parfor.setCounterEnd(getNumActs()-1); </PRE_CODE> <PARFOR NAME=parfor> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numActs/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <ITERATE> <PRE_CODE> int range= (getMax()-getMin()+1)/getNumActs(); int minNum = range*getCounter()+getMin(); int maxNum = minNum+range-1; if (getCounter() == getNumActs()-1) maxNum = getMax(); findPrimes.setMin(minNum); findPrimes.setMax(maxNum); findPrimes.setNumPrimes(getNumPrimes()); findPrimes.setPrimes(getPrimes()); </PRE_CODE> <ACTIVITY TYPE=FindPrimes NAME=findPrimes/> </ITERATE> </PARFOR> </BODY> <OUT_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> </PROCESS_TYPE> Middleware for Grid Computing 88 <ACTIVITY_TYPE NAME=FindPrimes> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=min/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=max/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=int NAME=numPrimes/> <IN_PARAMETER TYPE=RemoteCollection NAME=primes/> <CODE> for (int num=getMin(); num<=getMax(); num++) { // stop, required number of primes was found if (primes.size() >= getNumPrimes()) break; boolean prime = true; for (int i=2; i<num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { prime = false; break; } } if (prime) { primes.add(new Integer(num)); } } </CODE> </ACTIVITY_TYPE> Firstly, a process type that finds prime numbers, named FindPrimes, is defined. It receives, through its input parameters, a range of integers in which prime numbers have to be found, the number of primes to be returned, and the number of activities to be executed in order to perform this work. At the end, the found prime numbers are returned as a collection through its output parameter. This process contains a PARFOR controller aiming to execute a determined number of parallel activities. It iterates from 0 to getNumActs() - 1, which determines the number of activities, starting a parallel activity in each iteration. In such case, the controller divides the whole range of numbers in subranges of the same size, and, in each iteration, starts a parallel activity that finds prime numbers in a specific subrange. These activities receive a shared object by reference in order to store the prime numbers just found and control if the required number of primes has been reached. Finally, it is defined the activity type, FindPrimes, used to find prime numbers in each subrange. It receives, through its input parameters, the range of numbers in which it has to find prime numbers, the total number of prime numbers to be found by the whole process, and, passed by reference, a collection object to store the found prime numbers. Between its CODE markers, there is a simple code to find prime numbers, which iterates over the specified range and verifies if the current integer is a prime. Additionally, in each iteration, the code verifies if the required number of primes, inserted in the primes collection by all concurrent activities, has been reached, and exits if true. The advantage of using controllers is the possibility of the support infrastructure determines the point of execution the process is in, allowing automatic recovery and monitoring, and also the capability of instantiating and dispatching process elements only when there are enough computing resources available, reducing unnecessary overhead. Besides, due to its structured nature, they can be easily composed and the support infrastructure can take advantage of this in order to distribute hierarchically the nested controllers to Group Server Group Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Group Manager Process Server Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Process Coordinator Worker Java Virtual Machine RMI Activity Manager Repository Figure 2: Infrastructure architecture different machines over the grid, allowing enhanced scalability and fault-tolerance. 3. SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE The support infrastructure comprises tools for specification, and services for execution and monitoring of structured processes in highly distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous grid environments. It has services to monitor availability of resources in the grid, to interpret processes and schedule activities and controllers, and to execute activities. 3.1 Infrastructure Architecture The support infrastructure architecture is composed of groups of machines and data repositories, which preserves its administrative autonomy. Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group. Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM). This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2). In a group there are one or more group managers, but only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas. They are responsible to maintain availability information of group machines. Moreover, group managers maintain references to data resources of the group. They use group repositories to persist and recover the location of nodes and their availability. To control process execution, there are one or more process coordinators per group. They are responsible to instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources, and schedule and dispatch activities to workers. In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories. Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager. It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers. They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does. Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3). Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability. Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups. Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information. In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4. PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow. After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types. At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group. Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started. The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially. If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available. Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine. Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element. Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid. It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group. Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers. Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process. Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources. The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups. Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers. In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller. Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers. Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure. A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller. In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity. If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution. Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created. In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller. Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends. At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5. RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks. Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known. Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined. The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones. However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order. They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms. Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment. Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution. The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination. In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment. In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable. It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local. In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration. Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources. The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant. But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery. Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next. This makes easier to monitor and control processes. Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one. This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups. This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing. There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks. In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner. This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller. These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid. Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes. The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution. After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance. Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.

Para abordar dicho tema, este documento presenta un modelo de programación y una infraestructura que programa jerárquicamente las actividades de procesos utilizando nodos disponibles en un entorno de cuadrícula amplio. Sus ventajas son la distribución automática y estructurada de las actividades y el fácil monitoreo y dirección de procesos.

Introducción La computación de la cuadrícula es un modelo para la computación distribuida y paralela de área amplia a través de redes heterogéneas en múltiples dominios administrativos. Este campo de investigación tiene como objetivo promover el intercambio de recursos y proporciona poder informático innovador sobre esta amplia red de organizaciones virtuales de manera perfecta [8]. Tradicionalmente, como en Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10], existe una infraestructura mínima que proporciona intercambio de recursos de datos, gestión de utilización de recursos computacionales y ejecución distribuida. Específicamente, considerando la ejecución distribuida, la mayoría de las infraestructuras de cuadrícula existentes admiten la ejecución de tareas aisladas, pero no consideran las interdependencias de sus tareas como en los procesos (flujos de trabajo) [12]. Esta deficiencia restringe mejores algoritmos de programación, coordinación de ejecución distribuida y recuperación de ejecución automática. Hay pocas infraestructuras de middleware propuestas que admiten la ejecución del proceso a través de la cuadrícula. En general, modelan procesos interconectando sus actividades a través de control y dependencias de datos. Entre ellos, Webflow [1] enfatiza una arquitectura para construir procesos distribuidos;Opera-G [3] proporciona recuperación de ejecución y dirección, Gridflow [5] se centra en los algoritmos de programación mejorados que aprovechan las dependencias de actividades, y Swindew [13] admite la ejecución totalmente distribuida en redes entre pares. Sin embargo, tales infraestructuras contienen algoritmos de programación que están centralizados por el proceso [1, 3, 5] o completamente distribuidas, pero difíciles de monitorear y controlar [13]. Para abordar tales restricciones, este documento propone un modelo de programación estructurado para la descripción del proceso y una infraestructura jerárquica de ejecución del proceso. El modelo de programación emplea un flujo de control estructurado para promover la ejecución de la actividad controlada y contextualizada. Complementaria, la infraestructura de soporte, que ejecuta una especificación de proceso, aprovecha la estructura jerárquica de un proceso específico para distribuir y programar actividades dependientes fuertes como una unidad, lo que permite un mejor rendimiento de ejecución y tolerancia a fallas y proporcionar comunicación localizada. El modelo de programación y la infraestructura de soporte, llamada X Avantes, están en implementación para mostrar la viabilidad del modelo propuesto y demostrar sus dos ventajas principales: promover la ejecución y programación de procesos ampliamente distribuidas, pero en una programación controlada, estructurada y localizada.forma. La siguiente sección describe el modelo de programación y la Sección 3, la infraestructura de soporte para el modelo de computación de la cuadrícula propuesto. La Sección 4 demuestra cómo la infraestructura de soporte ejecuta procesos y distribuye actividades. Los trabajos relacionados se presentan y se comparan con el modelo propuesto en la Sección 5. La última sección concluye este documento que abarca las ventajas del soporte de ejecución de procesos jerárquicos propuesto para el área informática de la red y enumera algunos trabajos futuros.87 Middleware 2004 Controlador de actividades de procesamiento de procesamiento complementario 1 * 1 * Figura 1: Marco de alto nivel del modelo de programación 2. Modelo de programación El modelo de programación diseñado para la arquitectura informática de la cuadrícula es muy similar al especificado al lenguaje de ejecución de procesos de negocios (BPEL) [2]. Ambos describen procesos en documentos XML [4], pero el primero especifica procesos estrictamente sincrónicos y estructurados, y tiene más construcciones para el control paralelo estructurado. La razón detrás de su diseño es la posibilidad de distribuir jerárquicamente el control y la coordinación del proceso basado en construcciones estructuradas, de manera diferente a BPEL, que no permite la composición jerárquica de los procesos. En el modelo de programación propuesto, un proceso es un conjunto de actividades interdependientes organizadas para resolver un cierto problema. En detalle, un proceso está compuesto por actividades, subprocesos y controladores (ver Figura 1). Las actividades representan tareas simples que se ejecutan en nombre de un proceso;Los subprocesos son procesos ejecutados en el contexto de un proceso principal;y los controladores son elementos de control utilizados para especificar la orden de ejecución de estas actividades y subprocesos. Al igual que los lenguajes estructurados, los controladores pueden anidarse y luego determinar la orden de ejecución de otros controladores. Los datos se intercambian entre los elementos de proceso a través de los parámetros. Se pasan por valor, en caso de objetos simples, o por referencia, si son objetos remotos compartidos entre elementos del mismo controlador o proceso. Se puede acceder a datos externos a través de fuentes de datos, como bases de datos relacionales o objetos distribuidos.2.1 Controladores Los controladores son construcciones de control estructuradas utilizadas para definir el flujo de control de los procesos. Hay controladores secuenciales y paralelos. Los tipos de controlador secuencial son: bloque, interruptor, para y mientras. El controlador de bloque es una construcción secuencial simple, y los otros imitan construcciones de lenguaje de programación estructurado equivalente. Del mismo modo, los tipos paralelos son: PAR, Parswitch, Parfor y Parver. Extienden las contrapartes secuenciales respectivas para permitir la ejecución paralela de elementos de proceso. Todos los tipos de controlador paralelo desembolsan la ejecución de uno o más elementos de proceso, y luego, espere a que finalice cada ejecución. De hecho, contienen un tenedor y una unión de ejecución. Con el objetivo de implementar una unión condicional, todos los tipos de controlador paralelo contienen una condición de salida, evaluada todo el tiempo que termina una ejecución de elementos, para determinar cuándo debe terminar el controlador. El Parfor y Parwhile son las versiones iterativas de los tipos de controlador paralelo. Ambas ejecuciones de bifurcación, mientras que la condición de iteración es verdadera. Esto proporciona flexibilidad para determinar, en tiempo de ejecución, el número de elementos de proceso para ejecutar simultáneamente. En comparación con los idiomas de flujo de trabajo, los tipos de controlador paralelo representan versiones estructuradas de los constructores de control del flujo de trabajo, ya que pueden anidar otros controladores y también pueden expresar horquillas y uniones fijas y condicionales, presentes en tales idiomas.2.2 Ejemplo del proceso Esta sección presenta un ejemplo de una aplicación de búsqueda de números primos que recibe una cierta gama de enteros y devuelve un conjunto de primos contenidos en este rango. Todo el cálculo se realiza mediante un proceso, que utiliza un controlador paralelo para comenzar y enviar varias actividades concurrentes del mismo tipo, para encontrar números primos. La parte del documento XML que describe el proceso y los tipos de actividad se muestra a continuación.<Process_type name = findPrimes> <in_parameter type = int name = min/> <in_parameter type = int name = max/> <in_parameter type = int name = numPrimes/> <in_parameter type = int name = numacts/> <body> <body> <body>Pre_code> setPrimes (new RemoteHashSet ());parfor.setmin (getmin ());parfor.setMax (getMax ());parfor.setNumPrimes (getNumPrimes ());parfor.setNumacts (getNumacts ());parfor.setPrimes (getPrimes ());parfor.setCounterbegin (0);parfor.setCounterend (getNumacts ()-1);</Pre_code> <parfor name = parfor> <in_parameter type = int name = min/> <in_parameter type = int name = max/> <in_parameter type = int name = numPrimes/> <in_parameter type = int name = numacts/><In_parameter type = remotecollection name = primes/> <iterate> <pre_code> int range = (getMax ()-getmin ()+1)/getNumacts ();int minnum = range*getCounter ()+getmin ();int maxnum = minnum+range-1;if (getCounter () == getNumacts ()-1) maxnum = getmax ();findpimes.setmin (minnum);findpimes.setMax (maxnum);findprimes.setNumPrimes (getNumPrimes ());findpimes.setPrimes (getPrimes ());</Pre_code> <Activity type = findPrimes name = findPrimes/> </terate> </pfor> </body> <ut_parameter type = remotecollection name = primes/> </oCESS_TYPE> Middleware para la reducción de la red 88 <Activity_Type name = findPrimes> <In_parameter type = int name = min/> <in_parameter type = int name = max/> <in_parameter type = int name = numPrimes/> <in_parameter type = remotecollection name = primes/> <code> for (int num = getmins(); num <= getMax (); num ++) {// detener, el número de primos requerido se encontró si (primos.size ()> = getNumPrimes ()) break;boolean prime = verdadero;for (int i = 2; i <num; i ++) {if (num % i == 0) {prime = false;romper;}} if (prime) {primes.add (nuevo entero (num));}} </code> </activity_type> En primer lugar, se define un tipo de proceso que encuentra números primos, llamado FindPrimes. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, una gama de enteros en los que se deben encontrar números primos, el número de primos que se devolverán y el número de actividades que se ejecutarán para realizar este trabajo. Al final, los números primos encontrados se devuelven como una colección a través de su parámetro de salida. Este proceso contiene un controlador PARFOR con el objetivo de ejecutar un número determinado de actividades paralelas. Se itera de 0 a getNumacts () - 1, que determina el número de actividades, comenzando una actividad paralela en cada iteración. En tal caso, el controlador divide todo el rango de números en subranges del mismo tamaño y, en cada iteración, comienza una actividad paralela que encuentra números primos en un subrangule específico. Estas actividades reciben un objeto compartido por referencia para almacenar los números primos que se acaba de encontrar y controlar si se ha alcanzado el número de números primos requeridos. Finalmente, se define el tipo de actividad, FindPrimes, utilizado para encontrar números primos en cada subrangule. Recibe, a través de sus parámetros de entrada, el rango de números en los que tiene que encontrar números primos, el número total de números primos que se encuentran por todo el proceso y, aprobado por referencia, un objeto de colección para almacenar los números primos encontrados.. Entre sus marcadores de código, hay un código simple para encontrar números primos, que itera sobre el rango especificado y verifica si el entero actual es un primo. Además, en cada iteración, el código verifica si el número requerido de primos, insertado en la colección de primos por todas las actividades concurrentes, se ha alcanzado y sale si es cierto. La ventaja de usar controladores es la posibilidad de que la infraestructura de soporte determine el punto de ejecución en el que se encuentra el proceso, permitiendo la recuperación y el monitoreo automáticos, y también la capacidad de instanciar y enviar elementos del proceso solo cuando hay suficientes recursos informáticos disponibles, reduciendo la sobrecarga innecesaria. Además, debido a su naturaleza estructurada, se pueden componer fácilmente y la infraestructura de soporte puede aprovechar esto para distribuir jerárquicamente los controladores anidados al grupo Group Group Java Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Group Manager Process Server Java Virtual Machine Virtual Machine RMI JDBC Process CoordinatorWorker Java Virtual Machine RMI Activity Manager Repositorio Figura 2: Arquitectura de infraestructura Diferentes máquinas sobre la red, lo que permite una mayor escalabilidad y tolerancia a fallas.3. Infraestructura de soporte La infraestructura de soporte comprende herramientas para especificaciones y servicios para la ejecución y monitoreo de procesos estructurados en entornos de cuadrícula altamente distribuidos, heterogéneos y autónomos. Tiene servicios para monitorear la disponibilidad de recursos en la red, interpretar procesos y actividades y controladores de programación, y para ejecutar actividades.3.1 Arquitectura de infraestructura La arquitectura de infraestructura de soporte está compuesta por grupos de máquinas y repositorios de datos, lo que preserva su autonomía administrativa. En general, las máquinas y repositorios localizados, como en las redes o grupos locales, forman un grupo. Cada máquina en un grupo debe tener una máquina virtual Java (JVM) [11], y una biblioteca de tiempo de ejecución de Java, además de una combinación de los siguientes servicios de soporte de cuadrícula: gerente de grupo (GM), coordinador de procesos (PC) y gerente de actividades (AM AM). Esta combinación determina qué tipo de nodo de grupo representa: un servidor de grupo, un servidor de procesos o simplemente un trabajador (ver Figura 2). En un grupo hay uno o más gerentes grupales, pero solo uno actúa como primario y los demás, como réplicas. Son responsables de mantener la información de disponibilidad de las máquinas grupales. Además, los gerentes grupales mantienen referencias a los recursos de datos del grupo. Utilizan repositorios grupales para persistir y recuperar la ubicación de los nodos y su disponibilidad. Para controlar la ejecución del proceso, hay uno o más coordinadores de procesos por grupo. Son responsables de instanciar y ejecutar procesos y controladores, seleccionar recursos y programar y enviar actividades a los trabajadores. Para persistir y recuperar la ejecución y los datos del proceso, y también cargar la especificación del proceso, utilizan repositorios de grupos. Finalmente, en varios nodos grupales hay un gerente de actividades. Es responsable de ejecutar actividades en la máquina alojada en nombre de los coordinadores de procesos grupales e informar la disponibilidad actual de la máquina asociada a los gerentes de grupo. También tienen colas de actividad colgantes, que contienen actividades que se ejecutarán.3.2 Relaciones entre grupos Para modelar la arquitectura de la red real, la infraestructura debe comprender varias redes locales, potencialmente todas, como lo hacen Internet. Con el objetivo de satisfacer esta intención, los grupos locales son 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM GM Figura 3: Relaciones entre grupos conectadas a otros, directa o indirectamente, a través de sus gerentes grupales (ver Figura 3). Cada gerente de grupo se ocupa de las solicitudes de su grupo (representado por elipses discontinuos), para registrar máquinas locales y mantener la disponibilidad de corresponsales. Además, los gerentes grupales se comunican con los gerentes grupales de otros grupos. Cada gerente de grupo exporta información de disponibilidad gruesa a gerentes grupales de grupos adyacentes y también recibe solicitudes de otros servicios externos para proporcionar información detallada de disponibilidad. De esta manera, si hay recursos disponibles en grupos externos, es posible enviar procesos, controladores y actividades a estos grupos para ejecutarlos en coordinadores de procesos externos y gerentes de actividades, respectivamente.4. Ejecución del proceso En la arquitectura de la red propuesta, se especifica un proceso en XML, utilizando controladores para determinar el flujo de control;hacer referencia a otros procesos y actividades;y pasar objetos a sus parámetros para definir el flujo de datos. Después de especificado, el proceso se compila en un conjunto de clases, que representan tipos de proceso, actividad y controlador específicos. En este momento, puede ser instanciado y ejecutado por un coordinador de proceso.4.1 Modelo dinámico Para ejecutar un proceso especificado, debe instanciarse haciendo referencia a su tipo en un servicio de coordinador de proceso de un grupo específico. Además, los parámetros iniciales deben pasarse a él, y luego se puede iniciar. El coordinador del proceso lleva a cabo el proceso ejecutando los elementos del proceso incluidos en su cuerpo secuencialmente. Si el elemento es un proceso o un controlador, el coordinador del proceso puede optar por ejecutarlo en la misma máquina o pasarlo a otro coordinador de proceso en una máquina remota, si está disponible. De lo contrario, si el elemento es una actividad, pasa a un administrador de actividades de una máquina disponible. Los coordinadores de procesos solicitan al gerente de grupo local que encuentre máquinas disponibles que contengan el servicio requerido, el coordinador de procesos o el administrador de actividades, para ejecutar un elemento de proceso. Luego, puede devolver una máquina local, una máquina en otro grupo o ninguno, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de dicho recurso en la red. Devuelve un trabajador externo (máquina del gerente de actividades) si no hay trabajadores disponibles en el grupo local;Y devuelve un servidor de procesos externo (máquina coordinadora de procesos), si no hay servidores de procesos disponibles o trabajadores en el grupo local. Obedeciendo esta regla, los gerentes de grupos intentan encontrar servidores de procesos en el mismo grupo de los trabajadores disponibles. Dicho procedimiento es seguido de manera recursiva por todos los procesos COGM Find -Primes Activity Am Find Primes Activity Am FindPrimes Activity Am FindPrimes Process PC Figura 4: Find Primess Process Execution Ordinators que ejecutan subprocesos o controladores de un proceso. Por lo tanto, debido a que los procesos están estructurados por elementos del proceso de anidación, la ejecución del proceso se distribuye automáticamente jerárquicamente a través de uno o más grupos de cuadrícula de acuerdo con la disponibilidad y localidad de los recursos informáticos. La ventaja de este modelo de distribución es la amplia ejecución del área, lo que aprovecha potencialmente todos los recursos de la cuadrícula;y la comunicación localizada de los elementos del proceso, porque los elementos dependientes fuertes, que están bajo el mismo controlador, se colocan en los mismos grupos o cercanos. Además, admite un fácil monitoreo y dirección, debido a sus controladores estructurados, que mantienen el estado y el control sobre sus elementos internos.4.2 Ejemplo de ejecución del proceso revisando el ejemplo que se muestra en la Sección 2.2, se especifica un tipo de proceso para encontrar números primos en un cierto rango de números. Para resolver este problema, crea una serie de actividades utilizando el controlador PARFOR. Cada actividad, entonces, encuentra primos en una parte determinada del rango de números. La Figura 4 muestra una instancia de este tipo de proceso que se ejecuta sobre la infraestructura propuesta. Se crea una instancia de proceso FindPrimes en un coordinador de proceso disponible (PC), que comienza a ejecutar el controlador PARFOR. En cada iteración de este controlador, el coordinador del proceso solicita al gerente del grupo (GM) un administrador de actividades disponible (AM) para ejecutar una nueva instancia de la actividad de FindPrimes. Si hay algún AM disponible en este grupo o en uno externo, el Coordinador del proceso envía la clase de actividad y los parámetros iniciales a este administrador de actividades y solicita su ejecución. De lo contrario, si no hay administrador de actividades disponible, el controlador ingresa en un estado de espera hasta que se ponga a disposición un administrador de actividades o se cree. Paralelamente, cada vez que termina una actividad, su resultado se envía de regreso al Coordinador del proceso, que lo registra en el controlador PARFOR. Luego, el controlador espera hasta que todas las actividades que se hayan iniciado se terminen, y termina. En este punto, el coordinador del proceso verifica que no hay otro elemento de proceso para ejecutar y finalizar el proceso.5. Trabajo relacionado Hay varios productos académicos y comerciales que prometen admitir la informática de la red, con el objetivo de proporcionar interfaces, protocolos y servicios para aprovechar el uso de un ampliamente middleware para la computación de la red 90 recursos distribuidos en redes heterogéneas y autónomas. Entre ellos, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] y Legion [10] son ampliamente conocidos. Con el objetivo de estandarizar las interfaces y servicios a la red, se ha definido la arquitectura de servicios de cuadrícula abierta (OGSA) [7]. Las arquitecturas de la red generalmente tienen servicios que administran recursos informáticos y distribuyen la ejecución de tareas independientes en las disponibles. Sin embargo, las arquitecturas emergentes mantienen dependencias de tareas y ejecutan automáticamente las tareas en un orden correcto. Aprovechan estas dependencias para proporcionar una recuperación automática y una mejor distribución y algoritmos de programación. Siguiendo dicho modelo, WebFlow [1] es una herramienta de especificación de proceso y un entorno de ejecución construido sobre CORBA que permite la composición gráfica de las actividades y su ejecución distribuida en un entorno de cuadrícula. Opera-G [3], como WebFlow, utiliza un lenguaje de especificación de proceso similar al diagrama de flujo de datos y los idiomas de flujo de trabajo, pero proporciona la recuperación de ejecución automática y la dirección limitada de la ejecución del proceso. Las arquitecturas previamente referidas y otros que promulgan procesos sobre la red tienen una coordinación centralizada. Para superar esta limitación, sistemas como Swindew [13] propusieron una ejecución de procesos ampliamente distribuida, en la que cada nodo sabe dónde ejecutar la próxima actividad o unir actividades en un entorno entre pares. En el área específica de distribución y programación de la actividad, enfatizado en este trabajo, el flujo de grid [5] es notable. Utiliza una programación de dos niveles: global y local. En el nivel local, tiene servicios que predicen la utilización de recursos informáticos y la duración de la actividad. Según esta información, GridFlow emplea una técnica pertinente que intenta pronosticar la hora y duración de la ejecución de la actividad para programarlos mejor los recursos disponibles. La arquitectura propuesta en este documento, que abarca un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte de ejecución, está ampliamente descentralizada, de manera diferente al flujo web y la ópera-G, es más escalable y tolerante a fallas. Pero, como este último, está diseñado para admitir la recuperación de la ejecución. En comparación con Swindew, la arquitectura propuesta contiene coordinadores de procesos ampliamente distribuidos, que coordinan los procesos o partes de ellos, de manera diferente a Swindew donde cada nodo tiene una visión limitada del proceso: solo la actividad que comienza a continuación. Esto hace que sea más fácil monitorear y controlar procesos. Finalmente, la infraestructura de soporte rompe el proceso y sus subprocesos para la ejecución de la red, lo que permite que un grupo requiera otro grupo para la coordinación y ejecución de los elementos del proceso en nombre del primero. Esto es diferente de GridFlow, que puede ejecutar un proceso en la mayoría de los dos niveles, con el nivel global como el único responsable de programar subprocesos en otros grupos. Esto puede limitar el rendimiento general de los procesos y hacer que el sistema sea menos escalable.6. La conclusión y la computación de la red de trabajo futura es un campo de investigación emergente que tiene la intención de promover la computación distribuida y paralela a través de la amplia red de dominios administrativos heterogéneos y autónomos de una manera perfecta, similar a lo que Internet hace al intercambio de datos. Existen varios productos que admiten la ejecución de tareas independientes sobre la red, pero solo unos pocos admiten la ejecución de procesos con tareas interdependientes. Para abordar dicho tema, este documento propone un modelo de programación y una infraestructura de soporte que permita la ejecución de procesos estructurados de una manera ampliamente distribuida y jerárquica. Esta infraestructura de soporte proporciona una distribución automática, estructurada y recursiva de los elementos de proceso sobre grupos de máquinas disponibles;mejor uso de recursos, debido a su creación a demanda de elementos de proceso;Monitoreo y dirección de proceso fácil, debido a su naturaleza estructurada;y comunicación localizada entre los elementos de proceso dependientes fuertes, que se colocan bajo el mismo controlador. Estas características contribuyen a una mejor escalabilidad, tolerancia a fallas y control para la ejecución de los procesos a través de la red. Además, abre puertas para mejores algoritmos de programación, mecanismos de recuperación y también esquemas de modificación dinámica. El próximo trabajo será la implementación de un mecanismo de recuperación que utiliza el estado de ejecución y datos de los procesos y controladores para recuperar la ejecución del proceso. Después de eso, es deseable avanzar en el algoritmo de programación para pronosticar el uso de la máquina en el mismo u otros grupos y prever la hora de inicio de los elementos del proceso, a fin de usar esta información para asignar recursos y, luego, obtener una mejor ejecución del procesoactuación. Finalmente, es interesante investigar esquemas de modificación dinámica de procesos a través de la red, para evolucionar y adaptar procesos a largo plazo al entorno de la red cambiante continuamente.7.

        "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
        "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
        "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
        "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
        "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
        "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
        "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
        "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
        "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
        "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
        "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
        "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
        "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
        "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
        "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
        "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
        "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
        "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",
        "Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known.",
        "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
        "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
        "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
        "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
        "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
        "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
        "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
        "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
        "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
        "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
        "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
        "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
        "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
        "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
        "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
        "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
        "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
        "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
        "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
        "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
        "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
        "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
        "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
        "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
        "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
        "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
        "Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.",

                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",

                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",

                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",

                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK <br>grid computing</br> is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "Traditionally, as in Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10], there is a minimal infrastructure that provides data resource sharing, computational resource utilization management, and distributed execution.",
                "Specifically, considering distributed execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12].",
                "This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery.",
                "There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.",
                "In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies.",
                "Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.",
                "However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].",
                "In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.",
                "The programming model employs structured control flow to promote controlled and contextualized activity execution.",
                "Complementary, the support infrastructure, which executes a process specification, takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of a specified process in order to distribute and schedule strong dependent activities as a unit, allowing a better execution performance and fault-tolerance and providing localized communication.",
                "The programming model and the support infrastructure, named X avantes, are under implementation in order to show the feasibility of the proposed model and to demonstrate its two major advantages: to promote widely distributed process execution and scheduling, but in a controlled, structured and localized way.",
                "Next Section describes the programming model, and Section 3, the support infrastructure for the proposed grid computing model.",
                "Section 4 demonstrates how the support infrastructure executes processes and distributes activities.",
                "Related works are presented and compared to the proposed model in Section 5.",

                "PROGRAMMING MODEL The programming model designed for the grid computing architecture is very similar to the specified to the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) [2].",
                "Both describe processes in XML [4] documents, but the former specifies processes strictly synchronous and structured, and has more constructs for structured parallel control.",
                "The rationale behind of its design is the possibility of hierarchically distribute the process control and coordination based on structured constructs, differently from BPEL, which does not allow hierarchical composition of processes.",
                "In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem.",
                "In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1).",
                "Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses.",
                "Like structured languages, controllers can be nested and then determine the execution order of other controllers.",
                "Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters.",
                "They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process.",
                "External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes.",
                "There are sequential and parallel controllers.",
                "The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while.",
                "The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs.",
                "Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile.",
                "They extend the respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements.",
                "All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish.",
                "Indeed, they contain a fork and a join of execution.",
                "Aiming to implement a conditional join, all parallel controller types contain an exit condition, evaluated all time that an element execution finishes, in order to determine when the controller must end.",
                "The parfor and parwhile are the iterative versions of the parallel controller types.",
                "Both fork executions while the iteration condition is true.",
                "This provides flexibility to determine, at run-time, the number of process elements to execute simultaneously.",
                "When compared to workflow languages, the parallel controller types represent structured versions of the workflow control constructors, because they can nest other controllers and also can express fixed and conditional forks and joins, present in such languages. 2.2 Process Example This section presents an example of a prime number search application that receives a certain range of integers and returns a set of primes contained in this range.",

                "Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group.",
                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",

                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",
                "In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4.",
                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",

                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",

                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "Traditionally, as in Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10], there is a minimal infrastructure that provides data resource sharing, computational resource utilization management, and distributed execution.",
                "Specifically, considering distributed execution, most of the existing grid infrastructures supports execution of isolated tasks, but they do not consider their task interdependencies as in processes (workflows) [12].",
                "This deficiency restricts better scheduling algorithms, distributed execution coordination and automatic execution recovery.",
                "There are few proposed middleware infrastructures that support process execution over the grid.",
                "In general, they model processes by interconnecting their activities through control and data dependencies.",
                "Among them, WebFlow [1] emphasizes an architecture to construct distributed processes; Opera-G [3] provides execution recovering and steering, GridFlow [5] focuses on improved scheduling algorithms that take advantage of activity dependencies, and SwinDew [13] supports totally distributed execution on peer-to-peer networks.",
                "However, such infrastructures contain scheduling algorithms that are centralized by process [1, 3, 5], or completely distributed, but difficult to monitor and control [13].",
                "In order to address such constraints, this paper proposes a structured programming model for process description and a hierarchical process execution infrastructure.",

                "In the proposed programming model, a process is a set of interdependent activities arranged to solve a certain problem.",
                "In detail, a process is composed of activities, subprocesses, and controllers (see Figure 1).",
                "Activities represent simple tasks that are executed on behalf of a process; subprocesses are processes executed in the context of a parent process; and controllers are control elements used to specify the execution order of these activities and subprocesses.",
                "Like structured languages, controllers can be nested and then determine the execution order of other controllers.",
                "Data are exchanged among process elements through parameters.",
                "They are passed by value, in case of simple objects, or by reference, if they are remote objects shared among elements of the same controller or process.",
                "External data can be accessed through data sources, such as relational databases or distributed objects. 2.1 Controllers Controllers are structured control constructs used to define the control flow of processes.",
                "There are sequential and parallel controllers.",
                "The sequential controller types are: block, switch, for and while.",
                "The block controller is a simple sequential construct, and the others mimic equivalent structured programming language constructs.",
                "Similarly, the parallel types are: par, parswitch, parfor and parwhile.",
                "They extend the respective sequential counterparts to allow parallel execution of process elements.",
                "All parallel controller types fork the execution of one or more process elements, and then, wait for each execution to finish.",
                "Indeed, they contain a fork and a join of execution.",
                "Aiming to implement a conditional join, all parallel controller types contain an exit condition, evaluated all time that an element execution finishes, in order to determine when the controller must end.",

                "Generally, localized machines and repositories, such as in local networks or clusters, form a group.",
                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",
                "This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2).",

                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",
                "In this way, if there are resources available in external groups, it is possible to send processes, controllers and activities to these groups in order to execute them in external process coordinators and activity managers, respectively. 4.",
                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",
                "Such procedure is followed recursively by all process coGM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Activity AM FindPrimes Process PC Figure 4: FindPrimes process execution ordinators that execute subprocesses or controllers of a process.",
                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",
                "Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known.",
                "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
                "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
                "Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.",

                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",

                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",

                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",

                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely <br>distributed process</br> execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",

                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely <br>distributed process</br> coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",

                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",

                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",

                "Each machine in a group must have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [11], and a Java Runtime Library, besides a combination of the following grid support services: group manager (GM), process coordinator (PC) and activity manager (AM).",
                "This combination determines what kind of group node it represents: a group server, a process server, or simply a worker (see Figure 2).",
                "In a group there are one or more group managers, but only one acts as primary and the others, as replicas.",
                "They are responsible to maintain availability information of group machines.",
                "Moreover, group managers maintain references to data resources of the group.",
                "They use group repositories to persist and recover the location of nodes and their availability.",
                "To control process execution, there are one or more process coordinators per group.",
                "They are responsible to instantiate and execute processes and controllers, select resources, and schedule and dispatch activities to workers.",
                "In order to persist and recover process execution and data, and also load process specification, they use group repositories.",
                "Finally, in several group nodes there is an activity manager.",
                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real grid architecture, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",
                "Each group manager deals with requests of its group (represented by dashed ellipses), in order to register local machines and maintain correspondent availability.",
                "Additionally, group managers communicate to group managers of other groups.",
                "Each group manager exports coarse availability information to group managers of adjacent groups and also receives requests from other external services to furnish detailed availability information.",

                "PROCESS EXECUTION In the proposed grid architecture, a process is specified in XML, using controllers to determine control flow; referencing other processes and activities; and passing objects to their parameters in order to define data flow.",
                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",
                "Also, the initial parameters must be passed to it, and then it can be started.",
                "The process coordinator carries out the process by executing the process elements included in its body sequentially.",
                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",

                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
                "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",

                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",

                "It is responsible to execute activities in the hosted machine on behalf of the group process coordinators, and to inform the current availability of the associated machine to group managers.",
                "They also have pendent activity queues, containing activities to be executed. 3.2 Inter-group Relationships In order to model real <br>grid architecture</br>, the infrastructure must comprise several, potentially all, local networks, like Internet does.",
                "Aiming to satisfy this intent, local groups are 89 Middleware 2004 Companion GM GM GM GM Figure 3: Inter-group relationships connected to others, directly or indirectly, through its group managers (see Figure 3).",

                "After specified, the process is compiled in a set of classes, which represent specific process, activity and controller types.",
                "At this time, it can be instantiated and executed by a process coordinator. 4.1 Dynamic Model To execute a specified process, it must be instantiated by referencing its type on a process coordinator service of a specific group.",

                "If the element is a process or a controller, the process coordinator can choose to execute it in the same machine or to pass it to another process coordinator in a remote machine, if available.",
                "Else, if the element is an activity, it passes to an activity manager of an available machine.",
                "Process coordinators request the local group manager to find available machines that contain the required service, process coordinator or activity manager, in order to execute a process element.",
                "Then, it can return a local machine, a machine in another group or none, depending on the availability of such resource in the grid.",
                "It returns an external worker (activity manager machine) if there are no available workers in the local group; and, it returns an external process server (process coordinator machine), if there are no available process servers or workers in the local group.",
                "Obeying this rule, group managers try to find process servers in the same group of the available workers.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",
                "Each activity, then, finds primes in a determined part of the range of numbers.",
                "Figure 4 shows an instance of this process type executing over the proposed infrastructure.",
                "A FindPrimes process instance is created in an available process coordinator (PC), which begins executing the parfor controller.",
                "In each iteration of this controller, the process coordinator requests to the group manager (GM) an available activity manager (AM) in order to execute a new instance of the FindPrimes activity.",
                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "Therefore, because processes are structured by nesting process elements, the process execution is automatically distributed hierarchically through one or more grid groups according to the availability and locality of computing resources.",
                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",

                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",

                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",

                "The advantage of this distribution model is wide area execution, which takes advantage of potentially all grid resources; and localized communication of process elements, because strong dependent elements, which are under the same controller, are placed in the same or near groups.",
                "Besides, it supports easy monitoring and steering, due to its structured controllers, which maintain state and control over its inner elements. 4.2 Process Execution Example Revisiting the example shown in Section 2.2, a process type is specified to find prime numbers in a certain range of numbers.",
                "In order to solve this problem, it creates a number of activities using the parfor controller.",

                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",

                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",

                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",

                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",

                "If there is any AM available in this group or in an external one, the process coordinator sends the activity class and initial parameters to this activity manager and requests its execution.",
                "Else, if no activity manager is available, then the controller enters in a wait state until an activity manager is made available, or is created.",
                "In parallel, whenever an activity finishes, its result is sent back to the process coordinator, which records it in the parfor controller.",
                "Then, the controller waits until all activities that have been started are finished, and it ends.",
                "At this point, the process coordinator verifies that there is no other process element to execute and finishes the process. 5.",
                "RELATED WORK There are several academic and commercial products that promise to support grid computing, aiming to provide interfaces, protocols and services to leverage the use of widely Middleware for Grid Computing 90 distributed resources in heterogeneous and autonomous networks.",
                "Among them, Globus [6], Condor-G [9] and Legion [10] are widely known.",
                "Aiming to standardize interfaces and services to grid, the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) [7] has been defined.",
                "The grid architectures generally have services that manage computing resources and distribute the execution of independent tasks on available ones.",
                "However, emerging architectures maintain task dependencies and automatically execute tasks in a correct order.",
                "They take advantage of these dependencies to provide automatic recovery, and better distribution and scheduling algorithms.",
                "Following such model, WebFlow [1] is a process specification tool and execution environment constructed over CORBA that allows graphical composition of activities and their distributed execution in a grid environment.",
                "Opera-G [3], like WebFlow, uses a process specification language similar to the data flow diagram and workflow languages, but furnishes automatic execution recovery and limited steering of process execution.",
                "The previously referred architectures and others that enact processes over the grid have a centralized coordination.",
                "In order to surpass this limitation, systems like SwinDew [13] proposed a widely distributed process execution, in which each node knows where to execute the next activity or join activities in a peer-to-peer environment.",
                "In the specific area of activity distribution and scheduling, emphasized in this work, GridFlow [5] is remarkable.",
                "It uses a two-level scheduling: global and local.",
                "In the local level, it has services that predict computing resource utilization and activity duration.",
                "Based on this information, GridFlow employs a PERT-like technique that tries to forecast the activity execution start time and duration in order to better schedule them to the available resources.",
                "The architecture proposed in this paper, which encompasses a programming model and an execution support infrastructure, is widely decentralized, differently from WebFlow and Opera-G, being more scalable and fault-tolerant.",
                "But, like the latter, it is designed to support execution recovery.",
                "Comparing to SwinDew, the proposed architecture contains widely distributed process coordinators, which coordinate processes or parts of them, differently from SwinDew where each node has a limited view of the process: only the activity that starts next.",
                "This makes easier to monitor and control processes.",
                "Finally, the support infrastructure breaks the process and its subprocesses for grid execution, allowing a group to require another group for the coordination and execution of process elements on behalf of the first one.",
                "This is different from GridFlow, which can execute a process in at most two levels, having the global level as the only responsible to schedule subprocesses in other groups.",
                "This can limit the overall performance of processes, and make the system less scalable. 6.",
                "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Grid computing is an emerging research field that intends to promote distributed and parallel computing over the wide area network of heterogeneous and autonomous administrative domains in a seamless way, similar to what Internet does to the data sharing.",
                "There are several products that support execution of independent tasks over grid, but only a few supports the execution of processes with interdependent tasks.",
                "In order to address such subject, this paper proposes a programming model and a support infrastructure that allow the execution of structured processes in a widely distributed and hierarchical manner.",
                "This support infrastructure provides automatic, structured and recursive distribution of process elements over groups of available machines; better resource use, due to its on demand creation of process elements; easy process monitoring and steering, due to its structured nature; and localized communication among strong dependent process elements, which are placed under the same controller.",
                "These features contribute to better scalability, fault-tolerance and control for processes execution over the grid.",
                "Moreover, it opens doors for better scheduling algorithms, recovery mechanisms, and also, dynamic modification schemes.",
                "The next work will be the implementation of a recovery mechanism that uses the execution and data state of processes and controllers to recover process execution.",
                "After that, it is desirable to advance the scheduling algorithm to forecast machine use in the same or other groups and to foresee start time of process elements, in order to use this information to pre-allocate resources and, then, obtain a better process execution performance.",
                "Finally, it is interesting to investigate schemes of dynamic modification of processes over the grid, in order to evolve and adapt long-term processes to the continuously changing grid environment. 7.",
