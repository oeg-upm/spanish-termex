The framework makes it possible to study the outcomes of an argumentation-based negotiation. It shows what an agreement is, how it is related to the theories of the agents, when it is possible, and how this can be attained by the negotiating agents in this case. It defines also the notion of concession, and shows in which situation an agent will make one, as well as how it influences the evolution of the dialogue.

INTRODUCTION Roughly speaking, negotiation is a process aiming at finding some compromise or consensus between two or several agents about some matters of collective agreement, such as pricing products, allocating resources, or choosing candidates. Negotiation models have been proposed for the design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with other agents for example, buying or selling products in ecommerce. Different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which usually assume complete information and unlimited computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their behaviors (e.g. an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue. Indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers. Integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a good means for supplying additional information and also helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments during a negotiation dialogue. Indeed, an offer supported by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give up some of them. The basic idea behind an argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the theories of the agents (i.e. their mental states) may evolve, and consequently, the status of offers may change. For instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it. However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer. Several proposals have been made in the literature for modeling such an approach. However, the work is still preliminary. Some researchers have mainly focused on relating argumentation with protocols. They have shown how and when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and exchanged. Others have emphasized on the decision making problem. In [3, 7], the authors argued that selecting an offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision making problem. They have thus proposed an argumentationbased decision model, and have shown how such a model can be related to the dialogue protocol. In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues. It is not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of the dialogue. Moreover, basic concepts in negotiation such as agreement (i.e. optimal solutions, or compromise) and concession are neither defined nor studied. This paper aims to propose a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing systems can be restated. In this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers, whose structure is not known. The goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the preferences of both agents. Each agent is supposed to have a theory represented in an abstract way. A theory consists of a set A of arguments whose structure and origin are not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in O, the arguments of A that support it, a non specified conflict relation among the arguments, and finally a preference relation between the arguments. The status of each argument is defined using Dungs acceptability semantics. Consequently, the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable, rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers. We show how an agents theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue. We define formally the notions of concession, compromise, and optimal solution. Then, we propose a protocol that allows agents i) to exchange offers and arguments, and ii) to make concessions when necessary. We show that dialogues generated under such a protocol terminate, and even reach optimal solutions when they exist. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the logical language that is used in the rest of the paper. Section 3 defines the agents as well as their theories. In section 4, we study the properties of these agents theories. Section 5 defines formally an argumentation-based negotiation, shows how the theories of agents may evolve during a dialogue, and how this evolution may influence the outcome of the dialogue. Two kinds of outcomes: optimal solution and compromise are defined, and we show when such outcomes are reached. Section 6 illustrates our general framework through some examples. Section 7 compares our formalism with existing ones. Section 8 concludes and presents some perspectives. Due to lack of space, the proofs are not included. These last are in a technical report that we will make available online at some later time. 2. THE LOGICAL LANGUAGE In what follows, L will denote a logical language, and ≡ is an equivalence relation associated with it. From L, a set O = {o1, . . . , on} of n offers is identified, such that oi, oj ∈ O such that oi ≡ oj. This means that the offers are different. Offers correspond to the different alternatives that can be exchanged during a negotiation dialogue. For instance, if the agents try to decide the place of their next meeting, then the set O will contain different towns. Different arguments can be built from L. The set Args(L) will contain all those arguments. By argument, we mean a reason in believing or of doing something. In [3], it has been argued that the selection of the best offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision problem. In [4], it has been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished: arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments supporting beliefs. Moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in different ways, and they play different roles. Indeed, an argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agents beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments. Consequently, in a negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents. In what follows, the set Args(L) is then divided into two subsets: a subset Argso(L) of arguments supporting offers, and a subset Argsb(L) of arguments supporting beliefs. Thus, Args(L) = Argso(L) ∪ Argsb(L). As in [5], in what follows, we consider that the structure of the arguments is not known. Since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built may be inconsistent, the arguments may be conflicting too. In what follows, those conflicts will be captured by the relation RL, thus RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L). Three assumptions are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting. The idea behind this assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue. Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the arguments of Argsb(L). The second hypothesis says that arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting. The idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments. The third condition does not allow an argument in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a belief. This avoids wishful thinking. Formally: Definition 1. RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L) is a conflict relation among arguments such that: • ∀a, a ∈ Argso(L), s.t. a = a , a RL a • a ∈ Argso(L) and a ∈ Argsb(L) such that a RL a Note that the relation RL is not symmetric. This is due to the fact that arguments of Argsb(L) may be conflicting but not necessarily in a symmetric way. In what follows, we assume that the set Args(L) of arguments is finite, and each argument is attacked by a finite number of arguments. 3. NEGOTIATING AGENTS THEORIES AND REASONING MODELS In this section we define formally the negotiating agents, i.e. their theories, as well as the reasoning model used by those agents in a negotiation dialogue. 3.1 Negotiating agents theories Agents involved in a negotiation dialogue, called negotiating agents, are supposed to have theories. In this paper, the theory of an agent will not refer, as usual, to its mental states (i.e. its beliefs, desires and intentions). However, it will be encoded in a more abstract way in terms of the arguments owned by the agent, a conflict relation among those arguments, a preference relation between the arguments, and a function that specifies which arguments support offers of the set O. We assume that an agent is aware of all the arguments of the set Args(L). The agent is even able to express a preference between any pair of arguments. This does not mean that the agent will use all the arguments of Args(L), but it encodes the fact that when an agent receives an argument from another agent, it can interpret it correctly, and it can also compare it with its own arguments. Similarly, each agent is supposed to be aware of the conflicts between arguments. This also allows us to encode the fact that an agent can recognize whether the received argument is in conflict or not with its arguments. However, in its theory, only the conflicts between its own arguments are considered. Definition 2 (Negotiating agent theory). Let O be a set of n offers. A negotiating agent theory is a tuple A, F, , R, Def such that: • A ⊆ Args(L). 968 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) • F: O → 2A s.t ∀i, j with i = j, F(oi) ∩ F(oj) = ∅. Let AO = ∪F(oi) with i = 1, . . . , n. • ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L) is a partial preorder denoting a preference relation between arguments. • R ⊆ RL such that R ⊆ A × A • Def ⊆ A × A such that ∀ a, b ∈ A, a defeats b, denoted a Def b iff: - a R b, and - not (b a) The function F returns the arguments supporting offers in O. In [4], it has been argued that any decision may have arguments supporting it, called arguments PRO, and arguments against it, called arguments CONS. Moreover, these two types of arguments are not necessarily conflicting. For simplicity reasons, in this paper we consider only arguments PRO. Moreover, we assume that an argument cannot support two distinct offers. However, it may be the case that an offer is not supported at all by arguments, thus F(oi) may be empty. Example 1. Let O = {o1, o2, o3} be a set of offers. The following theory is the theory of agent i: • A = {a1, a2, a3, a4} • F(o1) = {a1}, F(o2) = {a2}, F(o3) = ∅. Thus, Ao = {a1, a2} • = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)} • R = {a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)} • Def = {(a4, a3), (a3, a2)} From the above definition of agent theory, the following hold: Property 1. • Def ⊆ R • ∀a, a ∈ F(oi), a R a 3.2 The reasoning model From the theory of an agent, one can define the argumentation system used by that agent for reasoning about the offers and the arguments, i.e. for computing the status of the different offers and arguments. Definition 3 (Argumentation system). Let A, F, , R, Def be the theory of an agent. The argumentation system of that agent is the pair A, Def . In [5], different acceptability semantics have been introduced for computing the status of arguments. These are based on two basic concepts, defence and conflict-free, defined as follows: Definition 4 (Defence/conflict-free). Let S ⊆ A. • S defends an argument a iff each argument that defeats a is defeated by some argument in S. • S is conflict-free iff there exist no a, a in S such that a Def a . Definition 5 (Acceptability semantics). Let S be a conflict-free set of arguments, and let T : 2A → 2A be a function such that T (S) = {a | a is defended by S}. • S is a complete extension iff S = T (S). • S is a preferred extension iff S is a maximal (w.r.t set ⊆) complete extension. • S is a grounded extension iff it is the smallest (w.r.t set ⊆) complete extension. Let E1, . . . , Ex denote the different extensions under a given semantics. Note that there is only one grounded extension. It contains all the arguments that are not defeated, and those arguments that are defended directly or indirectly by nondefeated arguments. Theorem 1. Let A, Def the argumentation system defined as shown above. 1. It may have x ≥ 1 preferred extensions. 2. The grounded extensions is S = i≥1 T (∅). Note that when the grounded extension (or the preferred extension) is empty, this means that there is no acceptable offer for the negotiating agent. Example 2. In example 1, there is one preferred extension, E = {a1, a2, a4}. Now that the acceptability semantics is defined, we are ready to define the status of any argument. Definition 6 (Argument status). Let A, Def be an argumentation system, and E1, . . . , Ex its extensions under a given semantics. Let a ∈ A. 1. a is accepted iff a ∈ Ei, ∀Ei with i = 1, . . . , x. 2. a is rejected iff Ei such that a ∈ Ei. 3. a is undecided iff a is neither accepted nor rejected. This means that a is in some extensions and not in others. Note that A = {a|a is accepted} ∪ {a|a is rejected} ∪ {a|a is undecided}. Example 3. In example 1, the arguments a1, a2 and a4 are accepted, whereas the argument a3 is rejected. As said before, agents use argumentation systems for reasoning about offers. In a negotiation dialogue, agents propose and accept offers that are acceptable for them, and reject bad ones. In what follows, we will define the status of an offer. According to the status of arguments, one can define four statuses of the offers as follows: Definition 7 (Offers status). Let o ∈ O. • The offer o is acceptable for the negotiating agent iff ∃ a ∈ F(o) such that a is accepted. Oa = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is acceptable}. • The offer o is rejected for the negotiating agent iff ∀ a ∈ F(o), a is rejected. Or = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is rejected}. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 969 • The offer o is negotiable iff ∀ a ∈ F(o), a is undecided. On = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is negotiable}. • The offer o is non-supported iff it is neither acceptable, nor rejected or negotiable. Ons = {oi ∈ O, such that oi is non-supported offers}. Example 4. In example 1, the two offers o1 and o2 are acceptable since they are supported by accepted arguments, whereas the offer o3 is non-supported since it has no argument in its favor. From the above definitions, the following results hold: Property 2. Let o ∈ O. • O = Oa ∪ Or ∪ On ∪ Ons. • The set Oa may contain more than one offer. From the above partition of the set O of offers, a preference relation between offers is defined. Let Ox and Oy be two subsets of O. Ox Oy means that any offer in Ox is preferred to any offer in the set Oy. We can write also for two offers oi, oj, oi oj iff oi ∈ Ox, oj ∈ Oy and Ox Oy. Definition 8 (Preference between offers). Let O be a set of offers, and Oa, Or, On, Ons its partition. Oa On Ons Or. Example 5. In example 1, we have o1 o3, and o2 o3. However, o1 and o2 are indifferent. 4. THE STRUCTURE OF NEGOTIATION THEORIES In this section, we study the properties of the system developed above. We first show that in the particular case where A = AO (ie. all of the agents arguments refer to offers), the corresponding argumentation system will return at least one non-empty preferred extension. Theorem 2. Let A, Def an argumentation system such that A = AO. Then the system returns at least one extension E, such that |E| ≥ 1. We now present some results that demonstrate the importance of indifference in negotiating agents, and more specifically its relation to acceptable outcomes. We first show that the set Oa may contain several offers when their corresponding accepted arguments are indifferent w.r.t the preference relation . Theorem 3. Let o1, o2 ∈ O. o1, o2 ∈ Oa iff ∃ a1 ∈ F(o1), ∃ a2 ∈ F(o2), such that a1 and a2 are accepted and are indifferent w.r.t (i.e. a b and b a). We now study acyclic preference relations that are defined formally as follows. Definition 9 (Acyclic relation). A relation R on a set A is acyclic if there is no sequence a1, a2, . . . , an ∈ A, with n > 1, such that (ai, ai+1) ∈ R and (an, a1) ∈ R, with 1 ≤ i < n. Note that acyclicity prohibits pairs of arguments a, b such that a b and b a, ie., an acyclic preference relation disallows indifference. Theorem 4. Let A be a set of arguments, R the attacking relation of A defined as R ⊆ A × A, and an acyclic relation on A. Then for any pair of arguments a, b ∈ A, such that (a, b) ∈ R, either (a, b) ∈ Def or (b, a) ∈ Def (or both). The previous result is used in the proof of the following theorem that states that acyclic preference relations sanction extensions that support exactly one offer. Theorem 5. Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A. If E is an extension of <A, Def>, then |E ∩ AO| = 1. An immediate consequence of the above is the following. Property 3. Let A be a set of arguments such that A = AO. If the relation on A is acyclic, then each extension Ei of <A, Def>, |Ei| = 1. Another direct consequence of the above theorem is that in acyclic preference relations, arguments that support offers can participate in only one preferred extension. Theorem 6. Let A be a set of arguments, and an acyclic relation on A. Then the preferred extensions of A, Def are pairwise disjoint w.r.t arguments of AO. Using the above results we can prove the main theorem of this section that states that negotiating agents with acyclic preference relations do not have acceptable offers. Theorem 7. Let A, F, R, , Def be a negotiating agent such that A = AO and is an acyclic relation. Then the set of accepted arguments w.r.t A, Def is emtpy. Consequently, the set of acceptable offers, Oa is empty as well. 5. ARGUMENTATION-BASED NEGOTIATION In this section, we define formally a protocol that generates argumentation-based negotiation dialogues between two negotiating agents P and C. The two agents negotiate about an object whose possible values belong to a set O. This set O is supposed to be known and the same for both agents. For simplicity reasons, we assume that this set does not change during the dialogue. The agents are equipped with theories denoted respectively AP , FP , P , RP , DefP , and AC , FC , C , RC , DefC . Note that the two theories may be different in the sense that the agents may have different sets of arguments, and different preference relations. Worst yet, they may have different arguments in favor of the same offers. Moreover, these theories may evolve during the dialogue. 5.1 Evolution of the theories Before defining formally the evolution of an agents theory, let us first introduce the notion of dialogue moves, or moves for short. Definition 10 (Move). A move is a tuple mi = pi, ai, oi, ti such that: • pi ∈ {P, C} • ai ∈ Args(L) ∪ θ1 1 In what follows θ denotes the fact that no argument, or no offer is given 970 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) • oi ∈ O ∪ θ • ti ∈ N∗ is the target of the move, such that ti < i The function Player (resp. Argument, Offer, Target) returns the player of the move (i.e. pi) (resp. the argument of a move, i.e ai, the offer oi, and the target of the move, ti). Let M denote the set of all the moves that can be built from {P, C}, Arg(L), O . Note that the set M is finite since Arg(L) and O are assumed to be finite. Let us now see how an agents theory evolves and why. The idea is that if an agent receives an argument from another agent, it will add the new argument to its theory. Moreover, since an argument may bring new information for the agent, thus new arguments can emerge. Let us take the following example: Example 6. Suppose that an agent P has the following propositional knowledge base: ΣP = {x, y → z}. From this base one cannot deduce z. Lets assume that this agent receives the following argument {a, a → y} that justifies y. It is clear that now P can build an argument, say {a, a → y, y → z} in favor of z. In a similar way, if a received argument is in conflict with the arguments of the agent i, then those conflicts are also added to its relation Ri . Note that new conflicts may arise between the original arguments of the agent and the ones that emerge after adding the received arguments to its theory. Those new conflicts should also be considered. As a direct consequence of the evolution of the sets Ai and Ri , the defeat relation Defi is also updated. The initial theory of an agent i, (i.e. its theory before the dialogue starts), is denoted by Ai 0, Fi 0, i 0, Ri 0, Defi 0 , with i ∈ {P, C}. Besides, in this paper, we suppose that the preference relation i of an agent does not change during the dialogue. Definition 11 (Theory evolution). Let m1, . . ., mt, . . ., mj be a sequence of moves. The theory of an agent i at a step t > 0 is: Ai t, Fi t , i t, Ri t, Defi t such that: • Ai t = Ai 0 ∪ {ai, i = 1, . . . , t, ai = Argument(mi)} ∪ A with A ⊆ Args(L) • Fi t = O → 2Ai t • i t = i 0 • Ri t = Ri 0 ∪ {(ai, aj) | ai = Argument(mi), aj = Argument(mj), i, j ≤ t, and ai RL aj} ∪ R with R ⊆ RL • Defi t ⊆ Ai t × Ai t The above definition captures the monotonic aspect of an argument. Indeed, an argument cannot be removed. However, its status may change. An argument that is accepted at step t of the dialogue by an agent may become rejected at step t + i. Consequently, the status of offers also change. Thus, the sets Oa, Or, On, and Ons may change from one step of the dialogue to another. That means for example that some offers could move from the set Oa to the set Or and vice-versa. Note that in the definition of Rt, the relation RL is used to denote a conflict between exchanged arguments. The reason is that, such a conflict may not be in the set Ri of the agent i. Thus, in order to recognize such conflicts, we have supposed that the set RL is known to the agents. This allows us to capture the situation where an agent is able to prove an argument that it was unable to prove before, by incorporating in its beliefs some information conveyed through the exchange of arguments with another agent. This, unknown at the beginning of the dialogue argument, could give to this agent the possibility to defeat an argument that it could not by using its initial arguments. This could even lead to a change of the status of these initial arguments and this change would lead to the one of the associated offers status. In what follows, Oi t,x denotes the set of offers of type x, where x ∈ {a, n, r, ns}, of the agent i at step t of the dialogue. In some places, we can use for short the notation Oi t to denote the partition of the set O at step t for agent i. Note that we have: not(Oi t,x ⊆ Oi t+1,x). 5.2 The notion of agreement As said in the introduction, negotiation is a process aiming at finding an agreement about some matters. By agreement, one means a solution that satisfies to the largest possible extent the preferences of both agents. In case there is no such solution, we say that the negotiation fails. In what follows, we will discuss the different kinds of solutions that may be reached in a negotiation. The first one is the optimal solution. An optimal solution is the best offer for both agents. Formally: Definition 12 (Optimal solution). Let O be a set of offers, and o ∈ O. The offer o is an optimal solution at a step t ≥ 0 iff o ∈ OP t,a ∩ OC t,a Such a solution does not always exist since agents may have conflicting preferences. Thus, agents make concessions by proposing/accepting less preferred offers. Definition 13 (Concession). Let o ∈ O be an offer. The offer o is a concession for an agent i iff o ∈ Oi x such that ∃Oi y = ∅, and Oi y Oi x. During a negotiation dialogue, agents exchange first their most preferred offers, and if these last are rejected, they make concessions. In this case, we say that their best offers are no longer defendable. In an argumentation setting, this means that the agent has already presented all its arguments supporting its best offers, and it has no counter argument against the ones presented by the other agent. Formally: Definition 14 (Defendable offer). Let Ai t, Fi t , i t, Ri t, Defi t be the theory of agent i at a step t > 0 of the dialogue. Let o ∈ O such that ∃j ≤ t with Player(mj) = i and offer(mj) = o. The offer o is defendable by the agent i iff: • ∃a ∈ Fi t (o), and k ≤ t s.t. Argument(mk) = a, or • ∃a ∈ At \\Fi t (o) s.t. a Defi t b with - Argument(mk) = b, k ≤ t, and Player(mk) = i - l ≤ t, Argument(ml) = a The offer o is said non-defendable otherwise and NDi t is the set of non-defendable offers of agent i at a step t. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 971 5.3 Negotiation dialogue Now that we have shown how the theories of the agents evolve during a dialogue, we are ready to define formally an argumentation-based negotiation dialogue. For that purpose, we need to define first the notion of a legal continuation. Definition 15 (Legal move). A move m is a legal continuation of a sequence of moves m1, . . . , ml iff j, k < l, such that: • Offer(mj) = Offer(mk), and • Player(mj) = Player(mk) The idea here is that if the two agents present the same offer, then the dialogue should terminate, and there is no longer possible continuation of the dialogue. Definition 16 (Argumentation-based negotiation). An argumentation-based negotiation dialogue d between two agents P and C is a non-empty sequence of moves m1, . . . , ml such that: • pi = P iff i is even, and pi = C iff i is odd • Player(m1) = P, Argument(m1) = θ, Offer(m1) = θ, and Target(m1) = 02 • ∀ mi, if Offer(mi) = θ, then Offer(mi) oj, ∀ oj ∈ O\\(O Player(mi) i,r ∪ ND Player(mi) i ) • ∀i = 1, . . . , l, mi is a legal continuation of m1, . . . , mi−1 • Target(mi) = mj such that j < i and Player(mi) = Player(mj) • If Argument(mi) = θ, then: - if Offer(mi) = θ then Argument(mi) ∈ F(Offer(mi)) - if Offer(mi) = θ then Argument(mi) Def Player(mi) i Argument(Target(mi)) • i, j ≤ l such that mi = mj • m ∈ M such that m is a legal continuation of m1, . . . , ml Let D be the set of all possible dialogues. The first condition says that the two agents take turn. The second condition says that agent P starts the negotiation dialogue by presenting an offer. Note that, in the first turn, we suppose that the agent does not present an argument. This assumption is made for strategical purposes. Indeed, arguments are exchanged as soon as a conflict appears. The third condition ensures that agents exchange their best offers, but never the rejected ones. This condition takes also into account the concessions that an agent will have to make if it was established that a concession is the only option for it at the current state of the dialogue. Of course, as we have shown in a previous section, an agent may have several good or acceptable offers. In this case, the agent chooses one of them randomly. The fourth condition ensures that the moves are legal. This condition allows to terminate the dialogue as soon as an offer is presented by both agents. The fifth condition allows agents to backtrack. The sixth 2 The first move has no target. condition says that an agent may send arguments in favor of offers, and in this case the offer should be stated in the same move. An agent can also send arguments in order to defeat arguments of the other agent. The next condition prevents repeating the same move. This is useful for avoiding loops. The last condition ensures that all the possible legal moves have been presented. The outcome of a negotiation dialogue is computed as follows: Definition 17 (Dialogue outcome). Let d = m1, . . ., ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue. The outcome of this dialogue, denoted Outcome, is Outcome(d) = Offer(ml) iff ∃j < l s.t. Offer(ml) = Offer(mj), and Player(ml) = Player(mj). Otherwise, Outcome(d) = θ. Note that when Outcome(d) = θ, the negotiation fails, and no agreement is reached by the two agents. However, if Outcome(d) = θ, the negotiation succeeds, and a solution that is either optimal or a compromise is found. Theorem 8. ∀di ∈ D, the argumentation-based negotiation di terminates. The above result is of great importance, since it shows that the proposed protocol avoids loops, and dialogues terminate. Another important result shows that the proposed protocol ensures to reach an optimal solution if it exists. Formally: Theorem 9 (Completeness). Let d = m1, . . . , ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue. If ∃t ≤ l such that OP t,a ∩ OC t,a = ∅, then Outcome(d) ∈ OP t,a ∩ OC t,a. We show also that the proposed dialogue protocol is sound in the sense that, if a dialogue returns a solution, then that solution is for sure a compromise. In other words, that solution is a common agreement at a given step of the dialogue. We show also that if the negotiation fails, then there is no possible solution. Theorem 10 (Soundness). Let d = m1, . . . , ml be a argumentation-based negotiation dialogue. 1. If Outcome(d) = o, (o = θ), then ∃t ≤ l such that o ∈ OP t,x ∩ OC t,y, with x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}. 2. If Outcome(d) = θ, then ∀t ≤ l, OP t,x ∩ OC t,y = ∅, ∀ x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}. A direct consequence of the above theorem is the following: Property 4. Let d = m1, . . . , ml be a argumentationbased negotiation dialogue. If Outcome(d) = θ, then ∀t ≤ l, • OP t,r = OC t,a ∪ OC t,n ∪ OC t,ns, and • OC t,r = OP t,a ∪ OP t,n ∪ OP t,ns. 6. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES In this section we will present some examples in order to illustrate our general framework. Example 7 (No argumentation). Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers. Let P and C be two agents, equipped with the same theory: A, F, , R, Def such that A = ∅, F(o1) = F(o2) = ∅, = ∅, R = ∅, Def = ∅. In this case, it is clear that the two offers o1 and o2 are nonsupported. The proposed protocol (see Definition 16) will generate one of the following dialogues: 972 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 This dialogue ends with o1 as a compromise. Note that this solution is not considered as optimal since it is not an acceptable offer for the agents. P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o2, 2 This dialogue ends with o2 as a compromise. P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 This dialogue also ends with o2 as a compromise. The last possible dialgue is the following that ends with o1 as a compromise. P: m1 = P, θ, o2, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o1, 1 P: m3 = P, θ, o1, 2 Note that in the above example, since there is no exchange of arguments, the theories of both agents do not change. Let us now consider the following example. Example 8 (Static theories). Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers. The theory of agent P is AP , FP , P , RP , DefP such that: AP = {a1, a2}, FP (o1) = {a1}, FP (o2) = {a2}, P = {(a1, a2)}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefP = {a1, a2}. The argumentation system AP , DefP of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one. Consequently, the offer o1 is acceptable and o2 is rejected. The theory of agent C is AC , FC , C , RC , DefC such that: AC = {a1, a2}, FC (o1) = {a1}, FC (o2) = {a2}, C = {(a2, a1)}, RC = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefC = {a2, a1}. The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a2 as an accepted argument, and a1 as a rejected one. Consequently, the offer o2 is acceptable and o1 is rejected. The only possible dialogues that may take place between the two agents are the following: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, a2, o2, 3 The second possible dialogue is the following: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, a2, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, θ, o2, 3 Both dialogues end with failure. Note that in both dialogues, the theories of both agents do not change. The reason is that the exchanged arguments are already known to both agents. The negotiation fails because the agents have conflicting preferences. Let us now consider an example in which argumentation will allow agents to reach an agreement. Example 9 (Dynamic theories). Let O = {o1, o2} be the set of all possible offers. The theory of agent P is AP , FP , P , RP , DefP such that: AP = {a1, a2}, FP (o1) = {a1}, FP (o2) = {a2}, P = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, DefP = {(a1, a2)}. The argumentation system AP , DefP of this agent will return a1 as an accepted argument, and a2 as a rejected one. Consequently, the offer o1 is acceptable and o2 is rejected. The theory of agent C is AC , FC , C , RC , DefC such that: AC = {a1, a2, a3}, FC (o1) = {a1}, FC (o2) = {a2}, C = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, RC = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, DefC = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}. The argumentation system AC , DefC of this agent will return a3 and a2 as accepted arguments, and a1 as a rejected one. Consequently, the offer o2 is acceptable and o1 is rejected. The following dialogue may take place between the two agents: P: m1 = P, θ, o1, 0 C: m2 = C, θ, o2, 1 P: m3 = P, a1, o1, 2 C: m4 = C, a3, θ, 3 C: m5 = P, θ, o2, 4 At step 4 of the dialogue, the agent P receives the argument a3 from P. Thus, its theory evolves as follows: AP = {a1, a2, a3}, RP = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, DefP = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}. At this step, the argument a1 which was accepted will become rejected, and the argument a2 which was at the beginning of the dialogue rejected will become accepted. Thus, the offer o2 will be acceptable for the agent, whereas o1 will become rejected. At this step 4, the offer o2 is acceptable for both agents, thus it is an optimal solution. The dialogue ends by returning this offer as an outcome. 7. RELATED WORK Argumentation has been integrated in negotiation dialogues at the early nineties by Sycara [12]. In that work, the author has emphasized the advantages of using argumentation in negotiation dialogues, and a specific framework has been introduced. In [8], the different types of arguments that are used in a negotiation dialogue, such as threats and rewards, have been discussed. Moreover, a particular framework for negotiation have been proposed. In [9, 13], different other frameworks have been proposed. Even if all these frameworks are based on different logics, and use different definitions of arguments, they all have at their heart an exchange of offers and arguments. However, none of those proposals explain when arguments can be used within a negotiation, and how they should be dealt with by the agent that receives them. Thus the protocol for handling arguments was missing. Another limitation of the above frameworks is the fact that the argumentation frameworks they The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 973 use are quite poor, since they use a very simple acceptability semantics. In [2] a negotiation framework that fills the gap has been suggested. A protocol that handles the arguments was proposed. However, the notion of concession is not modeled in that framework, and it is not clear what is the status of the outcome of the dialogue. Moreover, it is not clear how an agent chooses the offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue. In [1, 7], the authors have focused mainly on this decision problem. They have proposed an argumentation-based decision framework that is used by agents in order to choose the offer to propose or to accept during the dialogue. In that work, agents are supposed to have a beliefs base and a goals base. Our framework is more general since it does not impose any specific structure for the arguments, the offers, or the beliefs. The negotiation protocol is general as well. Thus this framework can be instantiated in different ways by creating, in such manner, different specific argumentation-based negotiation frameworks, all of them respecting the same properties. Our framework is also a unified one because frameworks like the ones presented above can be represented within this framework. For example the decision making mechanism proposed in [7] for the evaluation of arguments and therefore of offers, which is based on a priority relation between mutually attacked arguments, can be captured by the relation defeat proposed in our framework. This relation takes simultaneously into account the attacking and preference relations that may exist between two arguments. 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation. Like any other argumentation-based negotiation framework, as it is evoked in (e.g. [10]), our framework has all the advantages that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present when related to the negotiation approaches based either on game theoretic models (see e.g. [11]) or heuristics ([6]). This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process. More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes. It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented. Our future work concerns several points. A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents. Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers. During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve. Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory. Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory. Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers. This is more akin to the way human take decisions. Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status. In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers. This preference relation can be refined. For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument. In [4], different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions. Our framework can thus be extended by integrating those criteria. Another interesting point to investigate is that of considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with different profiles. By profile, we mean the criterion used by an agent to compare its offers. 9. REFERENCES [1] L. Amgoud, S. Belabbes, and H. Prade.

Introducción aproximadamente hablando, la negociación es un proceso con el objetivo de encontrar algún compromiso o consenso entre dos o varios agentes sobre algunos asuntos de acuerdo colectivo, como fijación de precios, asignación de recursos o elegir candidatos. Se han propuesto modelos de negociación para el diseño de sistemas capaces de negociar de manera óptima con otros agentes, por ejemplo, comprando o vendiendo productos en comercio electrónico. Se han investigado diferentes enfoques para la negociación automatizada, incluidos los enfoques teóricos del juego (que generalmente asumen información completa y capacidades de cálculo ilimitadas) [11], enfoques basados en la heurística que intentan hacer frente a estas limitaciones [6], y enfoques basados en la argumentación [[2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] que enfatizan la importancia de intercambiar información y explicaciones entre los agentes negociadores para influir mutuamente en sus comportamientos (por ejemplo, un agente puede conceder un objetivo que tiene una pequeña prioridad) y, en consecuencia, elResultado del diálogo. De hecho, los dos primeros tipos de configuraciones no permiten la adición de información o intercambiar opiniones sobre ofertas. La integración de la teoría de la argumentación en la negociación proporciona un buen medio para suministrar información adicional y también ayuda a los agentes a convencerse mutuamente por argumentos adecuados durante un diálogo de negociación. De hecho, una oferta respaldada por un buen argumento tiene una mejor oportunidad de ser aceptada por un agente, y también puede hacerle revelar sus objetivos o renunciar a algunos de ellos. La idea básica detrás de un enfoque basado en la argumentación es que al intercambiar argumentos, las teorías de los agentes (es decir, sus estados mentales) pueden evolucionar y, en consecuencia, el estado de las ofertas puede cambiar. Por ejemplo, un agente puede rechazar una oferta porque no es aceptable para ello. Sin embargo, el agente puede cambiar de opinión si recibe un argumento fuerte a favor de esta oferta. Se han realizado varias propuestas en la literatura para modelar tal enfoque. Sin embargo, el trabajo sigue siendo preliminar. Algunos investigadores se han centrado principalmente en relacionar la argumentación con los protocolos. Han mostrado cómo y cuándo se pueden calcular e intercambiar argumentos a favor de las ofertas. Otros han enfatizado en el problema de la toma de decisiones. En [3, 7], los autores argumentaron que seleccionar una oferta para proponer en un paso dado del diálogo es un problema de toma de decisiones. Por lo tanto, han propuesto un modelo de decisión basado en argumentación y han demostrado cómo dicho modelo puede estar relacionado con el protocolo de diálogo. En la mayoría de los trabajos existentes, no existe un análisis formal profundo del papel de la argumentación en los diálogos de negociación. No está claro cómo la argumentación puede influir en el resultado del diálogo. Además, los conceptos básicos en la negociación, como el acuerdo (es decir, soluciones óptimas, o compromiso) y concesión no están definidos ni estudiados. Este documento tiene como objetivo proponer un marco unificado y general para la negociación basada en la argumentación, en el que se analiza formalmente el papel de la argumentación y donde se pueden reformular los sistemas existentes. En este marco, un diálogo de negociación tiene lugar entre dos agentes en un conjunto de ofertas, cuya estructura no se conoce. El objetivo de una negociación es encontrar entre los elementos de O, una oferta que satisface más o menos 967 978-81-904262-7-7 (RPS) c 2007 Ifaamas las preferencias de ambos agentes. Se supone que cada agente tiene una teoría representada de manera abstracta. Una teoría consiste en un conjunto A de argumentos cuya estructura y origen se desconoce, una función que especifica para cada posible oferta en o, los argumentos de A que lo apoyan, una relación de conflicto no especificada entre los argumentos y finalmente una relación de preferencia entrelos argumentos. El estado de cada argumento se define mediante semántica de aceptabilidad de estiércol. En consecuencia, el conjunto de ofertas se divide en cuatro subconjuntos: ofertas aceptables, rechazadas, negociables y no respaldadas. Mostramos cómo puede evolucionar la teoría de una agente durante un diálogo de negociación. Definimos formalmente las nociones de concesión, compromiso y solución óptima. Luego, proponemos un protocolo que permita a los agentes i) intercambiar ofertas y argumentos, y ii) hacer concesiones cuando sea necesario. Mostramos que los diálogos generados bajo dicho protocolo terminan e incluso alcanzan soluciones óptimas cuando existen. Este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: la Sección 2 presenta el lenguaje lógico que se usa en el resto del documento. La Sección 3 define a los agentes y sus teorías. En la Sección 4, estudiamos las propiedades de las teorías de estos agentes. La Sección 5 define formalmente una negociación basada en la argumentación, muestra cómo las teorías de los agentes pueden evolucionar durante un diálogo y cómo esta evolución puede influir en el resultado del diálogo. Se definen dos tipos de resultados: solución y compromiso óptimos, y mostramos cuándo se alcanzan tales resultados. La Sección 6 ilustra nuestro marco general a través de algunos ejemplos. La Sección 7 compara nuestro formalismo con los existentes. La Sección 8 concluye y presenta algunas perspectivas. Debido a la falta de espacio, las pruebas no están incluidas. Estos últimos están en un informe técnico que pondremos a disposición en línea en algún momento posterior.2. El lenguaje lógico en lo que sigue, L denotará un lenguaje lógico, y ≡ es una relación de equivalencia asociada con él. De l, un conjunto o = {o1 ,..., en} de n ofertas se identifica, de modo que oi, oj ∈ O tal que oi ≡ oj. Esto significa que las ofertas son diferentes. Las ofertas corresponden a las diferentes alternativas que se pueden intercambiar durante un diálogo de negociación. Por ejemplo, si los agentes intentan decidir el lugar de su próxima reunión, entonces el set O contendrá diferentes ciudades. Se pueden construir diferentes argumentos a partir de L. Los args establecidos (l) contendrán todos esos argumentos. Por argumento, nos referimos a una razón para creer o hacer algo. En [3], se ha argumentado que la selección de la mejor oferta para proponer en un paso dado del diálogo es un problema de decisión. En [4], se ha demostrado que en un enfoque basado en la argumentación para la toma de decisiones, se distinguen dos tipos de argumentos: argumentos que respaldan las opciones (o decisiones) y los argumentos que respaldan las creencias. Además, se ha reconocido que las dos categorías de argumentos se definen formalmente de diferentes maneras, y juegan diferentes roles. De hecho, un argumento a favor de una decisión, construido tanto en las creencias y objetivos de los agentes, trata de justificar la elección;Mientras que un argumento a favor de una creencia, construido solo a partir de creencias, trata de destruir los argumentos de decisión, en particular las creencias parte de esos argumentos de decisión. En consecuencia, en un diálogo de negociación, esos dos tipos de argumentos generalmente se intercambian entre los agentes. En lo que sigue, el set Args (l) se divide en dos subconjuntos: un subconjunto Argso (l) de argumentos que respaldan ofertas, y un subconjunto ArgsB (l) de argumentos que respaldan las creencias. Así, args (l) = argso (l) ∪ argsb (l). Como en [5], en lo que sigue, consideramos que la estructura de los argumentos no se conoce. Dado que las bases de conocimiento a partir de las cuales se construyen los argumentos pueden ser inconsistentes, los argumentos también pueden ser contradictorios. En lo que sigue, esos conflictos serán capturados por la relación rl, por lo tanto, rl ⊆ args (l) × args (l). Se hacen tres suposiciones sobre esta relación: primero los argumentos que respaldan diferentes ofertas son contradictorios. La idea detrás de esta suposición es que, dado que las ofertas son exclusivas, un agente tiene que elegir solo uno en un paso dado del diálogo. Tenga en cuenta que la relación RL no es necesariamente simétrica entre los argumentos de Argsb (l). La segunda hipótesis dice que los argumentos que respaldan la misma oferta también son conflictivas. La idea aquí es devolver el argumento más fuerte entre estos argumentos. La tercera condición no permite un argumento a favor de una oferta para atacar un argumento que respalda una creencia. Esto evita la ilusión. Formalmente: Definición 1. RL ⊆ args (l) × args (l) es una relación de conflicto entre los argumentos tal que: • ∀a, a ∈ Argso (L), S.T.a = a, a rl a • a ∈ Argso (l) y a ∈ Argsb (l) de modo que A rl una nota que la relación rl no es simétrica. Esto se debe al hecho de que los argumentos de argsb (l) pueden ser contradictorios pero no necesariamente de manera simétrica. En lo que sigue, suponemos que los argumentos establecidos (l) de argumentos son finitos, y cada argumento es atacado por un número finito de argumentos.3. Negociando teorías de agentes y modelos de razonamiento en esta sección Definimos formalmente los agentes negociadores, es decir, sus teorías, así como el modelo de razonamiento utilizado por esos agentes en un diálogo de negociación.3.1 Se supone que los agentes de los agentes negociadores involucrados en un diálogo de negociación, llamado agentes de negociación, tienen teorías. En este artículo, la teoría de un agente no se referirá, como de costumbre, a sus estados mentales (es decir, sus creencias, deseos e intenciones). Sin embargo, se codificará de una manera más abstracta en términos de los argumentos propiedad del agente, una relación de conflicto entre esos argumentos, una relación de preferencia entre los argumentos y una función que especifica qué argumentos respaldan las ofertas del conjunto O. Suponemos que un agente es consciente de todos los argumentos del conjunto args (l). El agente incluso puede expresar una preferencia entre cualquier par de argumentos. Esto no significa que el agente usará todos los argumentos de los args (l), pero codifica el hecho de que cuando un agente recibe un argumento de otro agente, puede interpretarlo correctamente, y también puede compararlo con sus propios argumentos. Del mismo modo, se supone que cada agente debe ser consciente de los conflictos entre argumentos. Esto también nos permite codificar el hecho de que un agente puede reconocer si el argumento recibido está en conflicto o no con sus argumentos. Sin embargo, en su teoría, solo se consideran los conflictos entre sus propios argumentos. Definición 2 (teoría del agente de negociación). Deje ser un conjunto de N Ofertas. Una teoría del agente de negociación es una tupla A, F ,, r, def que: • A ⊆ args (l).968 El sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) • F: O → 2A S.T ∀i, J con i = J, F (Oi) ∩ F (OJ) = ∅. Deje ao = ∪f (oi) con i = 1 ,..., n.• ⊆ Args (L) × Args (L) es un pedido anticipado parcial que denota una relación de preferencia entre los argumentos.• r ⊆ rl de tal manera que r ⊆ a × a • def ⊆ a × a tal que ∀ a, b ∈ A, a derrota b, denotó a def b iff: - a r b, y - no (b a) la función FDevuelve los argumentos que respaldan ofertas en O. En [4], se ha argumentado que cualquier decisión puede tener argumentos que lo respalden, llamados argumentos profesionales, y argumentos en contra, llamados Argumentos contras. Además, estos dos tipos de argumentos no son necesariamente contradictorios. Por razones de simplicidad, en este documento consideramos solo argumentos pro. Además, suponemos que un argumento no puede soportar dos ofertas distintas. Sin embargo, puede ser el caso de que una oferta no sea compatible con los argumentos, por lo tanto, F (OI) puede estar vacía. Ejemplo 1. Sea O = {o1, o2, o3} un conjunto de ofertas. La siguiente teoría es la teoría del agente I: • a = {a1, a2, a3, a4} • f (o1) = {a1}, f (o2) = {a2}, f (o3) = ∅. Así, ao = {a1, a2} • = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)} • r = {a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a2), (a4, a3)} • def = {(a4, a3), (a3, a2)} de la definición anterior de teoría del agente, la siguiente Hold: Propiedad 1. • def ⊆ r • ∀a, a ∈ F (oi), a r a 3.2 El modelo de razonamiento de la teoría de un agente, se puede definir el sistema de argumentación utilizado por ese agente para razonar sobre las ofertas y los argumentos, es decir, para calcular el estado de las diferentesofertas y argumentos. Definición 3 (sistema de argumentación). Sea A, F ,, R, DeF que sea la teoría de un agente. El sistema de argumentación de ese agente es el par A, def. En [5], se han introducido diferentes semánticas de aceptabilidad para calcular el estado de los argumentos. Estos se basan en dos conceptos básicos, defensa y conflictos, definidos de la siguiente manera: Definición 4 (defensa/libre de conflictos). Sea s ⊆ A. • S defiende un argumento en cada argumento que derrota a A es derrotado por algún argumento en S. • S no tiene conflictos si no existe a, a en s tal que una def a. Definición 5 (semántica de aceptabilidad). Sea s un conjunto de argumentos libres de conflictos, y T: 2a → 2a sea una función tal que t (s) = {a |A está defendido por S}.• S es una extensión completa IFF S = t (s).• S es una extensión preferida IFF S es una extensión completa (W.R.T set ⊆) completa.• S es una extensión fundamentada IFF Es la extensión completa más pequeña (W.R.T Set ⊆) completa. Deja E1 ,..., Ex denota las diferentes extensiones bajo una semántica dada. Tenga en cuenta que solo hay una extensión conectada. Contiene todos los argumentos que no son derrotados, y aquellos argumentos que se defienden directa o indirectamente por argumentos no abatidos. Teorema 1. Sea A, Def el sistema de argumentación definido como se muestra arriba.1. Puede tener x ≥ 1 extensiones preferidas.2. Las extensiones fundamentadas son s = i≥1 t (∅). Tenga en cuenta que cuando la extensión fundamentada (o la extensión preferida) está vacía, esto significa que no hay una oferta aceptable para el agente negociador. Ejemplo 2. En el ejemplo 1, hay una extensión preferida, e = {a1, a2, a4}. Ahora que se define la semántica de aceptabilidad, estamos listos para definir el estado de cualquier argumento. Definición 6 (estado del argumento). Sea A, Def ser un sistema de argumentación, y E1 ,...Ex sus extensiones bajo una semántica dada. Deje a ∈ A. 1. A se acepta si ∈ Ei, ∀ei con i = 1 ,..., X.2. A se rechaza si ai de tal manera que a ∈ Ei.3. A es indeciso si A no es aceptado ni rechazado. Esto significa que A está en algunas extensiones y no en otras. Tenga en cuenta que a = {a | a se acepta} ∪ {a | a es rechazado} ∪ {a | a es indeciso}. Ejemplo 3. En el Ejemplo 1, se aceptan los argumentos A1, A2 y A4, mientras que el argumento A3 es rechazado. Como se dijo antes, los agentes usan sistemas de argumentación para razonar sobre ofertas. En un diálogo de negociación, los agentes proponen y aceptan ofertas aceptables para ellos y rechazan las malas. En lo que sigue, definiremos el estado de una oferta. Según el estado de los argumentos, uno puede definir cuatro estados de las ofertas de la siguiente manera: Definición 7 (estado de ofertas). Sea O ∈ O. • La oferta O es aceptable para el agente negociador IFF ∃ a ∈ F (o) de modo que se acepte A. Oa = {oi ∈ O, de modo que oi es aceptable}.• La oferta O es rechazada para el agente negociador IFF ∀ a ∈ F (O), A es rechazado. O = {oi ∈ O, de modo que OI se rechace}. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 969 • La oferta o es negociable IFF ∀ a ∈ F (O), A está indeciso. On = {oi ∈ O, de modo que oi es negociable}.• La oferta o no es compatible si no es aceptable, ni rechazada o negociable. ONS = {oi ∈ O, de modo que OI es ofertas no soportadas}. Ejemplo 4. En el Ejemplo 1, las dos ofertas O1 y O2 son aceptables ya que están respaldadas por argumentos aceptados, mientras que la oferta O3 no es compatible ya que no tiene argumentos a su favor. De las definiciones anteriores, los siguientes resultados se mantienen: Propiedad 2. Sea O ∈ O. • O = OA ∪ o ∪ en ∪ ups.• El set OA puede contener más de una oferta. De la partición anterior del conjunto O de ofertas, se define una relación de preferencia entre ofertas. Deje que Ox y Oy sean dos subconjuntos de O. Ox oy significa que se prefiere cualquier oferta en OX a cualquier oferta en el conjunto. Podemos escribir también para dos ofertas de Oi, Oj, Oj iff oi ∈ Ox, oj ∈ Oy y ox oy. Definición 8 (preferencia entre ofertas). Sea O un conjunto de ofertas, y OA, o, en On, on su partición. OA en ons o. Ejemplo 5. En el Ejemplo 1, tenemos O1 O3 y O2 O3. Sin embargo, O1 y O2 son indiferentes.4. La estructura de las teorías de negociación En esta sección, estudiamos las propiedades del sistema desarrolladas anteriormente. Primero mostramos que en el caso particular donde a = ao (es decir, todos los argumentos de los agentes se refieren a las ofertas), el sistema de argumentación correspondiente devolverá al menos una extensión preferida no vacía. Teorema 2. Sea A, definir un sistema de argumentación de tal manera que a = ao. Luego, el sistema devuelve al menos una extensión E, de modo que | E |≥ 1. Ahora presentamos algunos resultados que demuestran la importancia de la indiferencia en la negociación de agentes, y más específicamente su relación con los resultados aceptables. Primero mostramos que el conjunto OA puede contener varias ofertas cuando sus argumentos aceptados correspondientes son indiferentes en la relación de preferencia. Teorema 3. Sea O1, O2 ∈ O. O1, O2 ∈ OA IFF ∃ A1 ∈ F (O1), ∃ A2 ∈ F (O2), de modo que A1 y A2 se aceptan y son indiferentes w.r.t (es decir, A B y B A). Ahora estudiamos relaciones acíclicas de preferencia que se definen formalmente de la siguiente manera. Definición 9 (relación acíclica). Una relación R en un conjunto A es acíclica si no hay secuencia A1, A2 ,..., an ∈ A, con n> 1, tal que (ai, ai+1) ∈ R y (an, a1) ∈ R, con 1 ≤ i <n.Tenga en cuenta que la aciclicidad prohíbe pares de argumentos A, B de modo que A B y B A, es decir, una relación de preferencia acíclica no permita la indiferencia. Teorema 4. Sea A un conjunto de argumentos, en la relación de ataque de A definida como R ⊆ A × A, y una relación acíclica en A. Luego, para cualquier par de argumentos a, b ∈ A, de modo que (a, b) ∈ R, ya sea (a, b) ∈ Def o (b, a) ∈ Def (o ambos). El resultado anterior se utiliza en la prueba del siguiente teorema que establece que las relaciones acíclicas de preferencia sancionan las extensiones que respaldan exactamente una oferta. Teorema 5. Sea un conjunto de argumentos y una relación acíclica sobre A. Si E es una extensión de <a, def>, entonces | e ∩ ao |= 1. Una consecuencia inmediata de lo anterior es lo siguiente. Propiedad 3. Sea un conjunto de argumentos de tal manera que a = ao. Si la relación en a es acíclica, entonces cada extensión Ei de <a, def>, | ei |= 1. Otra consecuencia directa del teorema anterior es que en las relaciones de preferencia acíclica, los argumentos que ofrece el apoyo pueden participar en una sola extensión preferida. Teorema 6. Sea un conjunto de argumentos y una relación acíclica sobre A. Entonces las extensiones preferidas de A, Def, son argumentos por pares de Ao. Usando los resultados anteriores, podemos probar el teorema principal de esta sección que establece que los agentes negociadores con relaciones de preferencia acíclica no tienen ofertas aceptables. Teorema 7. Deje que A, F, R, sea un agente negociador de tal manera que A = AO y sea una relación acíclica. Luego, el conjunto de argumentos aceptados W.R.T A, Def está vacío. En consecuencia, el conjunto de ofertas aceptables, OA también está vacía.5. Negociación basada en la argumentación En esta sección, definimos formalmente un protocolo que genera diálogos de negociación basados en argumentación entre dos agentes negociadores P y C. Los dos agentes negocian sobre un objeto cuyos valores posibles pertenecen a un conjunto O. Se supone que este conjunto O es conocido y lo mismo para ambos agentes. Por razones de simplicidad, suponemos que este conjunto no cambia durante el diálogo. Los agentes están equipados con teorías denotadas respectivamente AP, FP, P, RP, DEFP y AC, FC, C, RC, DEFC. Tenga en cuenta que las dos teorías pueden ser diferentes en el sentido de que los agentes pueden tener diferentes conjuntos de argumentos y diferentes relaciones de preferencia. Lo peor aún, pueden tener diferentes argumentos a favor de las mismas ofertas. Además, estas teorías pueden evolucionar durante el diálogo.5.1 Evolución de las teorías Antes de definir formalmente la evolución de la teoría de los agentes, primero introduzcamos la noción de movimientos de diálogo o se mueva para abreviar. Definición 10 (movimiento). Un movimiento es una tuple mi = pi, ai, oi, ti tal que: • pi ∈ {p, c} • ai ∈ Args (l) ∪ θ1 1 en lo que sigue θ denota el hecho de que ningún argumento, o ninguna oferta esDado 970 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (aamas 07) • oi ∈ O ∪ θ • ti ∈ N ∗ es el objetivo del movimiento, de modo que ti <i el reproductor de funciones (resp. Argumento, oferta, objetivo) Devuelve el jugador de la mudanza (es decir, PI) (resp. El argumento de un movimiento, es decir, AI, la oferta de OI y el objetivo del movimiento, TI). Deje que M denote el conjunto de todos los movimientos que se pueden construir a partir de {P, C}, Arg (l), o. Tenga en cuenta que el conjunto M es finito ya que se supone que Arg (L) y O son finitos. Veamos ahora cómo evoluciona la teoría de una agente y por qué. La idea es que si un agente recibe un argumento de otro agente, agregará el nuevo argumento a su teoría. Además, dado que un argumento puede traer nueva información para el agente, por lo tanto, pueden surgir nuevos argumentos. Tomemos el siguiente ejemplo: Ejemplo 6. Suponga que un agente P tiene la siguiente base de conocimiento proposicional: σp = {x, y → z}. De esta base no se puede deducir z. Supongamos que este agente recibe el siguiente argumento {a, a → y} que justifica y. Está claro que ahora P puede construir un argumento, digamos {A, A → Y, Y → Z} a favor de Z. De manera similar, si un argumento recibido está en conflicto con los argumentos del Agente I, entonces esos conflictos también se agregan a su relación. Tenga en cuenta que pueden surgir nuevos conflictos entre los argumentos originales del agente y los que surgen después de agregar los argumentos recibidos a su teoría. Esos nuevos conflictos también deben considerarse. Como consecuencia directa de la evolución de los conjuntos AI y RI, la relación de derrota Defi también se actualiza. La teoría inicial de un agente I (es decir, su teoría antes de que comience el diálogo), se denota por Ai 0, fi 0, i 0, ri 0, defi 0, con i ∈ {p, c}. Además, en este documento, suponemos que la relación de preferencia I de un agente no cambia durante el diálogo. Definición 11 (Evolución de la teoría). Deja que M1 ,..., Mt ,..., Mj será una secuencia de movimientos. La teoría de un agente i en un paso t> 0 es: ai t, fi t, i t, ri t, defi t tal que: • ai t = ai 0 ∪ {ai, i = 1 ,..., t, ai = argumento (mi)} ∪ a con a ⊆ args (l) • fi t = o → 2ai t • i t = i 0 • ri t = ri 0 ∪ ∪ {(ai, aj) |ai = argumento (mi), aj = argumento (mj), i, j ≤ t y ai rl aj} ∪ r con r ⊆ rl • defi t ⊆ ai t × ai t la definición anterior captura el aspecto monotónico de un argumento. De hecho, no se puede eliminar un argumento. Sin embargo, su estado puede cambiar. Un argumento que es aceptado en el paso T del diálogo por un agente puede ser rechazado en el paso t + i.En consecuencia, el estado de las ofertas también cambia. Por lo tanto, los conjuntos OA o, On, y ONS pueden cambiar de un paso del diálogo a otro. Eso significa, por ejemplo, que algunas ofertas podrían moverse del set OA al conjunto o al viceversa. Tenga en cuenta que en la definición de RT, la relación RL se usa para denotar un conflicto entre los argumentos intercambiados. La razón es que, tal conflicto puede no estar en el conjunto RI del agente i. Por lo tanto, para reconocer tales conflictos, hemos supuesto que el conjunto RL es conocido por los agentes. Esto nos permite capturar la situación en la que un agente puede probar un argumento que no pudo probar antes, incorporando en sus creencias alguna información transmitida a través del intercambio de argumentos con otro agente. Esto, desconocido al comienzo del argumento del diálogo, podría darle a este agente la posibilidad de derrotar un argumento de que no podía usar sus argumentos iniciales. Esto incluso podría conducir a un cambio del estado de estos argumentos iniciales y este cambio conduciría a uno de los estatus de ofertas asociadas. En lo que sigue, oi t, x denota el conjunto de ofertas del tipo X, donde x ∈ {a, n, r, ns}, del agente I al paso t del diálogo. En algunos lugares, podemos usar para abreviar la notación para denotar la partición del set O en el paso t para el agente i. Tenga en cuenta que tenemos: no (oi t, x ⊆ oi t+1, x).5.2 La noción de acuerdo como se dice en la introducción, la negociación es un proceso con el objetivo de encontrar un acuerdo sobre algunos asuntos. Por acuerdo, uno significa una solución que satisface en la mayor medida posible las preferencias de ambos agentes. En caso de que no haya tal solución, decimos que la negociación falla. En lo que sigue, discutiremos los diferentes tipos de soluciones que se pueden alcanzar en una negociación. El primero es la solución óptima. Una solución óptima es la mejor oferta para ambos agentes. Formalmente: Definición 12 (solución óptima). Sea O un conjunto de ofertas, y o ∈ O. La oferta O es una solución óptima en un paso t ≥ 0 iff o ∈ Op t, A ∩ oct, una solución de este tipo no siempre existe ya que los agentes pueden tener preferencias contradictorias. Por lo tanto, los agentes hacen concesiones proponiendo/aceptando ofertas menos preferidas. Definición 13 (concesión). Sea O ∈ O una oferta. La oferta o es una concesión para un agente i iff o ∈ Oi x tal que ∃oi y = ∅, y oi y oi x. Durante un diálogo de negociación, los agentes intercambian primero sus ofertas más preferidas, y si estas últimas son rechazadas, hacen concesiones. En este caso, decimos que sus mejores ofertas ya no son defendibles. En un entorno de argumentación, esto significa que el agente ya ha presentado todos sus argumentos que respaldan sus mejores ofertas, y no tiene un contrapeso contra los presentados por el otro agente. Formalmente: Definición 14 (oferta defendible). Sea ai t, fi t, i t, ri t, defi t la teoría del agente I en un paso t> 0 del diálogo. Sea o ∈ O tal que ∃j ≤ t con el reproductor (mj) = i y off (mj) = o. La oferta O es defendible por el agente I IFF: • ∃a ∈ Fi t (O), y k ≤ t s.t. Argumento (mk) = a, o • ∃a ∈ At \\ fi t (o) s.t.a defi t b con - argumento (mk) = b, k ≤ t y jugador (mk) = i - l ≤ t, argumento (ml) = a la oferta o se dice que no se puede defender de otra manera y ndi t es el conjunto deOfertas no defendibles del Agente I en un paso t.El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 971 5.3 Diálogo de negociación Ahora que hemos mostrado cómo evolucionan las teorías de los agentes durante un diálogo, estamos listos para definir formalmente un diálogo de negociación basado en la argumentación. Para ese propósito, debemos definir primero la noción de una continuación legal. Definición 15 (movimiento legal). Un movimiento M es una continuación legal de una secuencia de movimientos M1 ,..., ml iff j, k <l, tal que: • Oferta (MJ) = Oferta (MK) y • Player (MJ) = Player (MK) La idea aquí es que si los dos agentes presentan la misma oferta, entonces elEl diálogo debe terminar, y ya no hay una continuación posible del diálogo. Definición 16 (negociación basada en la argumentación). Un diálogo de negociación basado en argumentación D entre dos agentes P y C es una secuencia no vacía de movimientos M1 ,..., ml tal que: • Pi = P Iff I es uniforme, y Pi = C Iff I es impar • Player (M1) = P, Argumento (M1) = θ, Oferta (M1) = θ, y Target (M1) = =02 • ∀ MI, si se ofrece (mi) = θ, entonces ofrece (mi) oj, ∀ oj ∈ O \\ (o jugador (mi) i, r ∪ nd reproductor (mi) i) • ∀i = 1 ,..., L, MI es una continuación legal de M1 ,..., MI - 1 • Target (MI) = MJ tal que J <I y Player (MI) = Player (MJ) • if argumento (MI) = θ, entonces: - If Offer (MI) = θ entonces Argumento (MI)∈ F (Oferta (MI)) - If Oferta (MI) = θ entonces Argumento (MI) Def Player (MI) I Argumento (Target (MI)) • I, J ≤ L tal que MI = MJ • M ∈ M Talque M es una continuación legal de M1 ,..., ml Sea D el conjunto de todos los diálogos posibles. La primera condición dice que los dos agentes se turnan. La segunda condición dice que el Agente P comienza el diálogo de negociación presentando una oferta. Tenga en cuenta que, en el primer turno, suponemos que el agente no presenta un argumento. Esta suposición se hace para fines estratégicos. De hecho, los argumentos se intercambian tan pronto como aparece un conflicto. La tercera condición asegura que los agentes intercambien sus mejores ofertas, pero nunca las rechazadas. Esta condición también tiene en cuenta las concesiones que un agente tendrá que hacer si se estableció que una concesión es la única opción para el estado actual del diálogo. Por supuesto, como hemos demostrado en una sección anterior, un agente puede tener varias ofertas buenas o aceptables. En este caso, el agente elige a uno de ellos al azar. La cuarta condición asegura que los movimientos sean legales. Esta condición permite terminar el diálogo tan pronto como ambos agentes presenten una oferta. La quinta condición permite a los agentes retroceder. El sexto 2 El primer movimiento no tiene objetivo.La condición dice que un agente puede enviar argumentos a favor de las ofertas, y en este caso la oferta debe establecerse en el mismo movimiento. Un agente también puede enviar argumentos para derrotar a los argumentos del otro agente. La siguiente condición evita repetir el mismo movimiento. Esto es útil para evitar bucles. La última condición asegura que se hayan presentado todos los posibles movimientos legales. El resultado de un diálogo de negociación se calcula de la siguiente manera: Definición 17 (resultado del diálogo). Sea d = m1 ,..., Ml será un diálogo de negociación basado en argumentación. El resultado de este diálogo, el resultado denotado, es el resultado (d) = Oferta (ml) Iff ∃j <l S.T. Oferta (ML) = Oferta (MJ) y Player (ML) = Player (MJ). De lo contrario, resultado (d) = θ. Tenga en cuenta que cuando el resultado (d) = θ, la negociación falla y los dos agentes llegan a ningún acuerdo. Sin embargo, si el resultado (d) = θ, la negociación tiene éxito y se encuentra una solución que es óptima o un compromiso. Teorema 8. ∀Di ∈ D, la negociación basada en argumentación DI termina. El resultado anterior es de gran importancia, ya que muestra que el protocolo propuesto evita los bucles y los diálogos terminan. Otro resultado importante muestra que el protocolo propuesto asegura alcanzar una solución óptima si existe. Formalmente: Teorema 9 (integridad). Sea d = m1 ,..., Ml será un diálogo de negociación basado en la argumentación. Si ∃t ≤ l tal que op t, a ∩ oc t, a = ∅, entonces resultado (d) ∈ Op t, a ∩ oc t, a. También mostramos que el protocolo de diálogo propuesto es sólido en el sentido de que, si un diálogo devuelve una solución, esa solución es seguramente un compromiso. En otras palabras, esa solución es un acuerdo común en un paso dado del diálogo. Mostramos también que si la negociación falla, entonces no hay una solución posible. Teorema 10 (solidez). Sea d = m1 ,..., Ml será un diálogo de negociación basado en la argumentación.1. Si el resultado (d) = o, (o = θ), entonces ∃t ≤ l tal que o ∈ Op t, x ∩ oc t, y, con x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}.2. Si el resultado (d) = θ, entonces ∀t ≤ l, op t, x ∩ oc t, y = ∅, ∀ x, y ∈ {a, n, ns}. Una consecuencia directa del teorema anterior es la siguiente: Propiedad 4. Sea d = m1 ,..., Ml será un diálogo de negociación basado en la argumentación. Si el resultado (d) = θ, entonces ∀t ≤ l, • op t, r = oc t, a ∪ oc t, n ∪ oc t, ns y • oc t, r = op t, a ∪ op t,N ∪ Op t, ns.6. Ejemplos ilustrativos En esta sección presentaremos algunos ejemplos para ilustrar nuestro marco general. Ejemplo 7 (sin argumentación). Sea O = {O1, O2} el conjunto de todas las ofertas posibles. Sea P y C dos agentes, equipados con la misma teoría: A, F ,, R, def que A = ∅, F (O1) = F (O2) = ∅, = ∅, R = ∅, def = ∅. En este caso, está claro que las dos ofertas O1 y O2 no son compatibles. El protocolo propuesto (ver definición 16) generará uno de los siguientes diálogos: 972 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) P: M1 = P, θ, O1, 0 C: M2 = C, θ, O1, 1 Este diálogo termina con O1 como compromiso. Tenga en cuenta que esta solución no se considera óptima ya que no es una oferta aceptable para los agentes. P: M1 = P, θ, O1, 0 C: M2 = C, θ, O2, 1 P: M3 = P, θ, O2, 2 Este diálogo termina con O2 como compromiso. P: M1 = P, θ, O2, 0 C: M2 = C, θ, O2, 1 Este diálogo también termina con O2 como compromiso. El último marcado posible es lo siguiente que termina con O1 como compromiso. P: m1 = p, θ, o2, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o1, 1 p: m3 = p, θ, o1, 2 Tenga en cuenta que en el ejemplo anterior, dado que no hay intercambio de argumentos, las teoríasde ambos agentes no cambian. Consideremos ahora el siguiente ejemplo. Ejemplo 8 (teorías estáticas). Sea O = {O1, O2} el conjunto de todas las ofertas posibles. La teoría del agente p es ap, fp, p, rp, defp tal que: ap = {a1, a2}, fp (o1) = {a1}, fp (o2) = {a2}, p = {(a1,a2)}, rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defp = {a1, a2}. El sistema de argumentación AP, DEFP de este agente devolverá A1 como un argumento aceptado, y A2 como rechazado. En consecuencia, la oferta O1 es aceptable y O2 es rechazada. La teoría del agente C es AC, Fc, C, RC, Defc tal que: ac = {a1, a2}, fc (o1) = {a1}, fc (o2) = {a2}, c = {(a2,a1)}, rc = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defc = {a2, a1}. El sistema de argumentación AC, DEFC de este agente devolverá A2 como un argumento aceptado, y A1 como rechazado. En consecuencia, la oferta O2 es aceptable y O1 es rechazada. Los únicos diálogos posibles que pueden tener lugar entre los dos agentes son los siguientes: P: M1 = P, θ, O1, 0 C: M2 = C, θ, O2, 1 P: M3 = P, A1, O1, 2 C: m4 = c, a2, o2, 3 El segundo diálogo posible es el siguiente: p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, a2, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, a1, o1,2 C: M4 = C, θ, O2, 3 Ambos diálogos terminan con la falla. Tenga en cuenta que en ambos diálogos, las teorías de ambos agentes no cambian. La razón es que los argumentos intercambiados ya son conocidos por ambos agentes. La negociación falla porque los agentes tienen preferencias contradictorias. Consideremos ahora un ejemplo en el que la argumentación permitirá a los agentes llegar a un acuerdo. Ejemplo 9 (teorías dinámicas). Sea O = {O1, O2} el conjunto de todas las ofertas posibles. La teoría del agente p es ap, fp, p, rp, defp tal que: ap = {a1, a2}, fp (o1) = {a1}, fp (o2) = {a2}, p = {(a1,a2), (a3, a1)}, rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1)}, defp = {(a1, a2)}. El sistema de argumentación AP, DEFP de este agente devolverá A1 como un argumento aceptado, y A2 como rechazado. En consecuencia, la oferta O1 es aceptable y O2 es rechazada. La teoría del agente C es AC, Fc, C, RC, Defc tal que: ac = {a1, a2, a3}, fc (o1) = {a1}, fc (o2) = {a2}, c = {(((a1, a2), (a3, a1)}, rc = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, defc = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}. El sistema de argumentación AC, DEFC de este agente devolverá A3 y A2 como argumentos aceptados, y A1 como uno rechazado. En consecuencia, la oferta O2 es aceptable y O1 es rechazada. El siguiente diálogo puede tener lugar entre los dos agentes: p: m1 = p, θ, o1, 0 c: m2 = c, θ, o2, 1 p: m3 = p, a1, o1, 2 c: m4 = c,A3, θ, 3 C: M5 = P, θ, O2, 4 En el paso 4 del diálogo, el Agente P recibe el argumento A3 de P. Por lo tanto, su teoría evoluciona de la siguiente manera: AP = {A1, A2, A3}, Rp = {(a1, a2), (a2, a1), (a3, a1)}, defp = {(a1, a2), (a3, a1)}. En este paso, el argumento A1 que fue aceptado será rechazado, y el argumento A2 que fue al comienzo del diálogo rechazado será aceptado. Por lo tanto, la oferta O2 será aceptable para el agente, mientras que O1 será rechazado. En este paso 4, la oferta O2 es aceptable para ambos agentes, por lo tanto, es una solución óptima. El diálogo termina devolviendo esta oferta como resultado.7. La argumentación del trabajo relacionado se ha integrado en los diálogos de negociación a principios de los noventa por Sycara [12]. En ese trabajo, el autor ha enfatizado las ventajas de usar la argumentación en los diálogos de negociación, y se ha introducido un marco específico. En [8], se han discutido los diferentes tipos de argumentos que se utilizan en un diálogo de negociación, como amenazas y recompensas. Además, se ha propuesto un marco particular para la negociación. En [9, 13], se han propuesto otros marcos diferentes. Incluso si todos estos marcos se basan en diferentes lógicas y utilizan diferentes definiciones de argumentos, todos tienen en su corazón un intercambio de ofertas y argumentos. Sin embargo, ninguna de esas propuestas explica cuándo se pueden usar los argumentos dentro de una negociación y cómo el agente las recibirá que los recibe. Por lo tanto, faltaba el protocolo para manejar argumentos. Otra limitación de los marcos anteriores es el hecho de que los marcos de argumentación son el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y los sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 973 El uso es bastante pobre, ya que usan una semántica de aceptabilidad muy simple. En [2] se ha sugerido un marco de negociación que llena el vacío. Se propuso un protocolo que maneja los argumentos. Sin embargo, la noción de concesión no se modela en ese marco, y no está claro cuál es el estado del resultado del diálogo. Además, no está claro cómo un agente elige la oferta de proponerse en un paso dado del diálogo. En [1, 7], los autores se han centrado principalmente en este problema de decisión. Han propuesto un marco de decisión basado en la argumentación que utiliza los agentes para elegir la oferta de proponer o aceptar durante el diálogo. En ese trabajo, se supone que los agentes tienen una base de creencias y una base de metas. Nuestro marco es más general, ya que no impone ninguna estructura específica para los argumentos, las ofertas o las creencias. El protocolo de negociación también es general. Por lo tanto, este marco se puede instanciar de diferentes maneras creando, de tal manera, diferentes marcos de negociación específicos basados en argumentación, todos respetando las mismas propiedades. Nuestro marco también es unificado porque marcos como los presentados anteriormente se pueden representar dentro de este marco. Por ejemplo, el mecanismo de toma de decisiones propuesto en [7] para la evaluación de argumentos y, por lo tanto, de ofertas, que se basa en una relación prioritaria entre los argumentos atacados mutuamente, puede ser capturado por la relación de la relación propuesta en nuestro marco. Esta relación tiene en cuenta simultáneamente las relaciones de ataque y preferencia que pueden existir entre dos argumentos.8. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento hemos presentado un marco unificado y general para la negociación basada en la argumentación. Al igual que cualquier otro marco de negociación basado en la argumentación, como se evoca (por ejemplo, [10]), nuestro marco tiene todas las ventajas de que los enfoques de negociación basados en la argumentación se presentan cuando se relacionan con los enfoques de negociación basados en modelos teóricos del juego (ver, por ejemplo, [11]) o heurística ([6]). Este trabajo es un primer intento de definir formalmente el papel de la argumentación en el proceso de negociación. Más precisamente, por primera vez, establece formalmente el vínculo que existe entre el estado de los argumentos y las ofertas que apoyan, define la noción de concesión y muestra cómo influye en la evolución de la negociación, determina cómo las teorías deLos agentes evolucionan durante el diálogo y realizan un análisis de los resultados de la negociación. También es la primera vez que se presenta un estudio de las propiedades formales de las teorías de negociación de los agentes, así como de un diálogo de negociación argumentativo. Nuestro trabajo futuro se refiere a varios puntos. Un primer punto es relajar la suposición de que el conjunto de ofertas posibles es el mismo para ambos agentes. De hecho, es más natural suponer que los agentes pueden tener diferentes conjuntos de ofertas. Durante un diálogo de negociación, estos conjuntos evolucionarán. Los argumentos a favor de las nuevas ofertas se pueden construir a partir de la teoría del agente. Por lo tanto, el conjunto de ofertas será parte de la teoría del agente. Otra posible extensión de este trabajo sería permitir que los agentes manejaran tanto los argumentos y las contras. Esto es más parecido a la forma en que los humanos toman decisiones. Teniendo en cuenta ambos tipos de argumentos, refinará la evaluación del estado de las ofertas. En el modelo propuesto, una relación de preferencia entre ofertas se define sobre la base de la partición del conjunto de ofertas. Esta relación de preferencia puede ser refinada. Por ejemplo, entre las ofertas aceptables, uno puede preferir la oferta respaldada por el argumento más fuerte. En [4], se han propuesto diferentes criterios para comparar las decisiones. Nuestro marco puede extenderse por lo tanto integrando esos criterios. Otro punto interesante para investigar es considerar los diálogos de negociación entre dos agentes con diferentes perfiles. Por perfil, nos referimos al criterio utilizado por un agente para comparar sus ofertas.9. Referencias [1] L. Amgoud, S. Belabbes y H. Prade.

        "In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues.",

        "In this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers, whose structure is not known.",
        "The goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the preferences of both agents.",

        "Moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in different ways, and they play different roles.",
        "Indeed, an argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agents beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.",
        "Consequently, in a negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents.",

        "Three assumptions are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting.",

        "Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the arguments of Argsb(L).",
        "The second hypothesis says that arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting.",

        "RELATED WORK Argumentation has been integrated in negotiation dialogues at the early nineties by Sycara [12].",
        "In that work, the author has emphasized the advantages of using argumentation in negotiation dialogues, and a specific framework has been introduced.",
        "In [8], the different types of arguments that are used in a negotiation dialogue, such as threats and rewards, have been discussed.",
        "Moreover, a particular framework for negotiation have been proposed.",
        "In [9, 13], different other frameworks have been proposed.",
        "Even if all these frameworks are based on different logics, and use different definitions of arguments, they all have at their heart an exchange of offers and arguments.",
        "However, none of those proposals explain when arguments can be used within a negotiation, and how they should be dealt with by the agent that receives them.",
        "Thus the protocol for handling arguments was missing.",
        "Another limitation of the above frameworks is the fact that the argumentation frameworks they The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 973 use are quite poor, since they use a very simple acceptability semantics.",
        "In [2] a negotiation framework that fills the gap has been suggested.",
        "A protocol that handles the arguments was proposed.",
        "However, the notion of concession is not modeled in that framework, and it is not clear what is the status of the outcome of the dialogue.",
        "Moreover, it is not clear how an agent chooses the offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue.",
        "In [1, 7], the authors have focused mainly on this decision problem.",
        "They have proposed an argumentation-based decision framework that is used by agents in order to choose the offer to propose or to accept during the dialogue.",
        "In that work, agents are supposed to have a beliefs base and a goals base.",
        "Our framework is more general since it does not impose any specific structure for the arguments, the offers, or the beliefs.",
        "The negotiation protocol is general as well.",
        "Thus this framework can be instantiated in different ways by creating, in such manner, different specific argumentation-based negotiation frameworks, all of them respecting the same properties.",
        "Our framework is also a unified one because frameworks like the ones presented above can be represented within this framework.",
        "For example the decision making mechanism proposed in [7] for the evaluation of arguments and therefore of offers, which is based on a priority relation between mutually attacked arguments, can be captured by the relation defeat proposed in our framework.",
        "This relation takes simultaneously into account the attacking and preference relations that may exist between two arguments. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation.",
        "Like any other argumentation-based negotiation framework, as it is evoked in (e.g. [10]), our framework has all the advantages that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present when related to the negotiation approaches based either on game theoretic models (see e.g. [11]) or heuristics ([6]).",
        "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
        "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
        "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
        "Our future work concerns several points.",
        "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",
        "Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.",
        "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
        "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",
        "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory.",
        "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
        "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
        "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
        "In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.",
        "This preference relation can be refined.",
        "For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument.",
        "In [4], different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions.",
        "Our framework can thus be extended by integrating those criteria.",
        "Another interesting point to investigate is that of considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with different profiles.",
        "By profile, we mean the criterion used by an agent to compare its offers. 9.",

                "Indeed, an argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agents beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.",

                "Negotiation models have been proposed for the design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with other agents for example, buying or selling products in ecommerce.",
                "Different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which usually assume complete information and unlimited computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their behaviors (e.g. an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the <br>outcome</br> of the dialogue.",
                "Indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers.",
                "Integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a good means for supplying additional information and also helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments during a negotiation dialogue.",
                "Indeed, an offer supported by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give up some of them.",
                "The basic idea behind an argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the theories of the agents (i.e. their mental states) may evolve, and consequently, the status of offers may change.",
                "For instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it.",
                "However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer.",
                "Several proposals have been made in the literature for modeling such an approach.",
                "However, the work is still preliminary.",
                "Some researchers have mainly focused on relating argumentation with protocols.",
                "They have shown how and when arguments in favor of offers can be computed and exchanged.",
                "Others have emphasized on the decision making problem.",
                "In [3, 7], the authors argued that selecting an offer to propose at a given step of the dialogue is a decision making problem.",
                "They have thus proposed an argumentationbased decision model, and have shown how such a model can be related to the dialogue protocol.",
                "In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues.",
                "It is not clear how argumentation can influence the <br>outcome</br> of the dialogue.",
                "Moreover, basic concepts in negotiation such as agreement (i.e. optimal solutions, or compromise) and concession are neither defined nor studied.",
                "This paper aims to propose a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing systems can be restated.",
                "In this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers, whose structure is not known.",
                "The goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the preferences of both agents.",
                "Each agent is supposed to have a theory represented in an abstract way.",
                "A theory consists of a set A of arguments whose structure and origin are not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in O, the arguments of A that support it, a non specified conflict relation among the arguments, and finally a preference relation between the arguments.",
                "The status of each argument is defined using Dungs acceptability semantics.",

                "For example the decision making mechanism proposed in [7] for the evaluation of arguments and therefore of offers, which is based on a priority relation between mutually attacked arguments, can be captured by the relation defeat proposed in our framework.",

                "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
                "Our future work concerns several points.",
                "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",
                "Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.",
                "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent <br>theory</br>.",
                "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent <br>theory</br>.",
                "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
                "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
                "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
                "In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.",
                "This preference relation can be refined.",
                "For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument.",
                "In [4], different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions.",
                "Our framework can thus be extended by integrating those criteria.",
                "Another interesting point to investigate is that of considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with different profiles.",

                "Like any other argumentation-based negotiation framework, as it is evoked in (e.g. [10]), our framework has all the advantages that argumentation-based negotiation approaches present when related to the negotiation approaches based either on game theoretic models (see e.g. [11]) or heuristics ([6]).",
                "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
                "Our future work concerns several points.",
                "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",
                "Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.",
                "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the <br>agent</br> theory.",
                "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the <br>agent</br> theory.",
                "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
                "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
                "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
                "In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.",
                "This preference relation can be refined.",
                "For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument.",
                "In [4], different criteria have been proposed for comparing decisions.",
                "Our framework can thus be extended by integrating those criteria.",
                "Another interesting point to investigate is that of considering negotiation dialogues between two agents with different profiles.",

                "Negotiation models have been proposed for the design of systems able to bargain in an optimal way with other agents for example, buying or selling products in ecommerce.",
                "Different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which usually assume complete information and unlimited computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and argumentation-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their behaviors (e.g. an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue.",
                "Indeed, the two first types of settings do not allow for the addition of information or for exchanging opinions about offers.",
                "Integrating argumentation theory in negotiation provides a good means for supplying additional information and also helps agents to convince each other by adequate arguments during a negotiation dialogue.",
                "Indeed, an offer supported by a good argument has a better chance to be accepted by an agent, and can also make him reveal his goals or give up some of them.",
                "The basic idea behind an argumentationbased approach is that by exchanging arguments, the theories of the agents (i.e. their mental states) may evolve, and consequently, the status of offers may change.",
                "For instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it.",
                "However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer.",
                "Several proposals have been made in the literature for modeling such an approach.",

                "In most existing works, there is no deep formal analysis of the role of argumentation in negotiation dialogues.",
                "It is not clear how argumentation can influence the outcome of the dialogue.",

                "This paper aims to propose a unified and general framework for argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of argumentation is formally analyzed, and where the existing systems can be restated.",
                "In this framework, a negotiation dialogue takes place between two agents on a set O of offers, whose structure is not known.",
                "The goal of a negotiation is to find among elements of O, an offer that satisfies more or less 967 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS the preferences of both agents.",
                "Each agent is supposed to have a theory represented in an abstract way.",
                "A theory consists of a set A of arguments whose structure and origin are not known, a function specifying for each possible offer in O, the arguments of A that support it, a non specified conflict relation among the arguments, and finally a preference relation between the arguments.",
                "The status of each argument is defined using Dungs acceptability semantics.",
                "Consequently, the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable, rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers.",
                "We show how an agents theory may evolve during a negotiation dialogue.",
                "We define formally the notions of concession, compromise, and optimal solution.",
                "Then, we propose a protocol that allows agents i) to exchange offers and arguments, and ii) to make concessions when necessary.",
                "We show that dialogues generated under such a protocol terminate, and even reach optimal solutions when they exist.",
                "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the logical language that is used in the rest of the paper.",

                "In [4], it has been shown that in an argumentation-based approach for decision making, two kinds of arguments are distinguished: arguments supporting choices (or decisions), and arguments supporting beliefs.",
                "Moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in different ways, and they play different roles.",
                "Indeed, an argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agents beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.",
                "Consequently, in a negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents.",
                "In what follows, the set Args(L) is then divided into two subsets: a subset Argso(L) of arguments supporting offers, and a subset Argsb(L) of arguments supporting beliefs.",

                "As in [5], in what follows, we consider that the structure of the arguments is not known.",
                "Since the knowledge bases from which arguments are built may be inconsistent, the arguments may be conflicting too.",
                "In what follows, those conflicts will be captured by the relation RL, thus RL ⊆ Args(L) × Args(L).",
                "Three assumptions are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting.",
                "The idea behind this assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue.",
                "Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the arguments of Argsb(L).",
                "The second hypothesis says that arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting.",
                "The idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments.",
                "The third condition does not allow an argument in favor of an offer to attack an argument supporting a belief.",

                "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
                "Our future work concerns several points.",
                "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",

                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",

                "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
                "Our future work concerns several points.",
                "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",
                "Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.",
                "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",
                "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory.",
                "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
                "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
                "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
                "In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.",
                "This preference relation can be refined.",
                "For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest argument.",

                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",

                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",

                "This work is a first attempt to formally define the role of argumentation in the negotiation process.",
                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",
                "It is also the first time where a study of the formal properties of the negotiation theories of the agents as well as of an argumentative negotiation dialogue is presented.",
                "Our future work concerns several points.",
                "A first point is to relax the assumption that the set of possible offers is the same to both agents.",
                "Indeed, it is more natural to assume that agents may have different sets of offers.",
                "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",
                "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory.",
                "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
                "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
                "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
                "In the proposed model, a preference relation between offers is defined on the basis of the partition of the set of offers.",
                "This preference relation can be refined.",
                "For instance, among the acceptable offers, one may prefer the offer that is supported by the strongest <br>argument</br>.",

                "Different approaches to automated negotiation have been investigated, including game-theoretic approaches (which usually assume complete information and unlimited computation capabilities) [11], heuristic-based approaches which try to cope with these limitations [6], and <br>argumentation</br>-based approaches [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13] which emphasize the importance of exchanging information and explanations between negotiating agents in order to mutually influence their behaviors (e.g. an agent may concede a goal having a small priority), and consequently the outcome of the dialogue.",

                "For instance, an agent may reject an offer because it is not acceptable for it.",
                "However, the agent may change its mind if it receives a strong argument in favor of this offer.",

                "The status of each argument is defined using Dungs acceptability semantics.",
                "Consequently, the set of offers is partitioned into four subsets: acceptable, rejected, negotiable and non-supported offers.",

                "Moreover, it has been acknowledged that the two categories of arguments are formally defined in different ways, and they play different roles.",
                "Indeed, an argument in favor of a decision, built both on an agents beliefs and goals, tries to justify the choice; whereas an argument in favor of a belief, built only from beliefs, tries to destroy the decision arguments, in particular the beliefs part of those decision arguments.",
                "Consequently, in a negotiation dialogue, those two kinds of arguments are generally exchanged between agents.",

                "Three assumptions are made on this relation: First the arguments supporting different offers are conflicting.",
                "The idea behind this assumption is that since offers are exclusive, an agent has to choose only one at a given step of the dialogue.",
                "Note that, the relation RL is not necessarily symmetric between the arguments of Argsb(L).",
                "The second hypothesis says that arguments supporting the same offer are also conflicting.",
                "The idea here is to return the strongest argument among these arguments.",

                "More precisely, for the first time, it formally establishes the link that exists between the status of the arguments and the offers they support, it defines the notion of concession and shows how it influences the evolution of the negotiation, it determines how the theories of agents evolve during the dialogue and performs an analysis of the negotiation outcomes.",

                "During a negotiation dialogue, these sets will evolve.",
                "Arguments in favor of the new offers may be built from the agent theory.",
                "Thus, the set of offers will be part of the agent theory.",
                "Another possible extension of this work would be to allow agents to handle both arguments PRO and CONS offers.",
                "This is more akin to the way human take decisions.",
                "Considering both types of arguments will refine the evaluation of the offers status.",
