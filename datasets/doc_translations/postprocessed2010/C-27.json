Stankovic, David Luebke Department of Computer Science University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 {stoleru, tianhe, stankovic, luebke}@cs.virginia.edu ABSTRACT The problem of localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been regarded as very difficult to solve, when considering the realities of real world environments. In this paper, we formally describe, design, implement and evaluate a novel localization system, called Spotlight. Our system uses the spatio-temporal properties of well controlled events in the network (e.g., light), to obtain the locations of sensor nodes. We demonstrate that a high accuracy in localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware on the sensor nodes, as required by other localization systems. We evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of Mica2 and XSM motes. Through performance evaluations of a real system deployed outdoors, we obtain a 20cm localization error. A sensor network, with any number of nodes, deployed in a 2500m2 area, can be localized in under 10 minutes, using a device that costs less than $1000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error, obtained in an outdoor environment, without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with specialized ranging hardware.

INTRODUCTION Recently, wireless sensor network systems have been used in many promising applications including military surveillance, habitat monitoring, wildlife tracking etc. [12] [22] [33] [36]. While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically. Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed. An on-board GPS [23] is a typical high-end solution, which requires sophisticated hardware to achieve high resolution time synchronization with satellites. The constraints on power and cost for tiny sensor nodes preclude this as a viable solution. Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes. The difficulties of these approaches are twofold. First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited. For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26]. Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization. To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes. These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization. In addition, the radio propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment dependent, thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free localizations schemes. With such limitations in mind, this paper addresses the following research challenge: How to reconcile the need for high accuracy in location estimation with the cost to achieve it. Our answer to this challenge is a localization system called Spotlight. This system employs an asymmetric architecture, in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware, other than what they currently have. All the sophisticated hardware and computation reside on a single Spotlight device. The Spotlight device uses a steerable laser light source, illuminating the sensor nodes placed within a known terrain. We demonstrate that this localization is much more accurate (i.e., tens of centimeters) than the range-based localization schemes and that it has a much longer effective range (i.e., thousands of meters) than the solutions based on ultra-sound/acoustic ranging. At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2. RELATED WORK In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes. The localization problem is a fundamental research problem in many domains. In the field of robotics, it has been studied extensively [9] [10]. The reported localization errors are on the order of tens of centimeters, when using specialized ranging hardware, i.e. laser range finder or ultrasound. Due to the high cost and non-negligible form factor of the ranging hardware, these solutions can not be simply applied to sensor networks. The RSSI has been an attractive solution for estimating the distance between the sender and the receiver. The RADAR system [2] uses the RSSI to build a centralized repository of signal strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes. The location of a mobile user is estimated within a few meters. In a similar approach, MoteTrack [17] distributes the reference RSSI values to the beacon nodes. Solutions that use RSSI and do not require beacon nodes have also been proposed [5] [14] [24] [26] [29]. They all share the idea of using a mobile beacon. The sensor nodes that receive the beacons, apply different algorithms for inferring their location. In [29], Sichitiu proposes a solution in which the nodes that receive the beacon construct, based on the RSSI value, a constraint on their position estimate. In [26], Priyantha et al. propose MAL, a localization method in which a mobile node (moving strategically) assists in measuring distances between node pairs, until the constraints on distances generate a rigid graph. In [24], Pathirana et al. formulate the localization problem as an on-line estimation in a nonlinear dynamic system and proposes a Robust Extended Kalman Filter for solving it. Elnahrawy [8] provides strong evidence of inherent limitations of localization accuracy using RSSI, in indoor environments. A more precise ranging technique uses the time difference between a radio signal and an acoustic wave, to obtain pair wise distances between sensor nodes. This approach produces smaller localization errors, at the cost of additional hardware. The Cricket location-support system [25] can achieve a location granularity of tens of centimeters with short range ultrasound transceivers. AHLoS, proposed by Savvides et al. [27], employs Time of Arrival (ToA) ranging techniques that require extensive hardware and solving relatively large nonlinear systems of equations. A similar ToA technique is employed in [3]. In [30], Simon et al. implement a distributed system (using acoustic ranging) which locates a sniper in an urban terrain. Acoustic ranging for localization is also used by Kwon et al. [15]. The reported errors in localization vary from 2.2m to 9.5m, depending on the type (centralized vs. distributed) of the Least Square Scaling algorithm used. For wireless sensor networks ranging is a difficult option. The hardware cost, the energy expenditure, the form factor, the small range, all are difficult compromises, and it is hard to envision cheap, unreliable and resource-constraint devices make use of range-based localization solutions. However, the high localization accuracy, achievable by these schemes is very desirable. To overcome the challenges posed by the range-based localization schemes, when applied to sensor networks, a different approach has been proposed and evaluated in the past. This approach is called range-free and it attempts to obtain location information from the proximity to a set of known beacon nodes. Bulusu et al. propose in [4] a localization scheme, called Centroid, in which each node localizes itself to the centroid of its proximate beacon nodes. In [13], He et al. propose APIT, a scheme in which each node decides its position based on the possibility of being inside or outside of a triangle formed by any three beacon nodes heard by the node. The Global Coordinate System [20], developed at MIT, uses apriori knowledge of the node density in the network, to estimate the average hop distance. The DV-* family of localization schemes [21], uses the hop count from known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the distance. The majority of range-free localization schemes have been evaluated in simulations, or controlled environments. Several studies [11] [32] [34] have emphasized the challenges that real environments pose. Langendoen and Reijers present a detailed, comparative study of several localization schemes in [16]. To the best of our knowledge, Spotlight is the first range-free localization scheme that works very well in an outdoor environment. Our system requires a line of sight between a single device and the sensor nodes, and the map of the terrain where the sensor field is located. The Spotlight system has a long effective range (1000s meters) and does not require any infrastructure or additional hardware for sensor nodes. The Spotlight system combines the advantages and does not suffer from the disadvantages of the two localization classes. 3. SPOTLIGHT SYSTEM DESIGN The main idea of the Spotlight localization system is to generate controlled events in the field where the sensor nodes were deployed. An event could be, for example, the presence of light in an area. Using the time when an event is perceived by a sensor node and the spatio-temporal properties of the generated events, spatial information (i.e. location) regarding the sensor node can be inferred. Figure 1. Localization of a sensor network using the Spotlight system We envision, and depict in Figure 1, a sensor network deployment and localization scenario as follows: wireless sensor nodes are randomly deployed from an unmanned aerial vehicle. After deployment, the sensor nodes self-organize into a network and execute a time-synchronization protocol. An aerial vehicle (e.g. helicopter), equipped with a device, called Spotlight, flies over the network and generates light events. The sensor nodes detect the events and report back to the Spotlight device, through a base station, the timestamps when the events were detected. The Spotlight device computes the location of the sensor nodes. During the design of our Spotlight system, we made the following assumptions: - the sensor network to be localized is connected and a middleware, able to forward data from the sensor nodes to the Spotlight device, is present. - the aerial vehicle has a very good knowledge about its position and orientation (6 parameters: 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation) and it possesses the map of the field where the network was deployed. - a powerful Spotlight device is available and it is able to generate 14 spatially large events that can be detected by the sensor nodes, even in the presence of background noise (daylight). - a line of sight between the Spotlight device and sensor nodes exists. Our assumptions are simplifying assumptions, meant to reduce the complexity of the presentation, for clarity. We propose solutions that do not rely on these simplifying assumptions, in Section 6. In order to formally describe and generalize the Spotlight localization system, we introduce the following definitions. 3.1 Definitions and Problem Formulation Lets assume that the space A ⊂R3 contains all sensor nodes N, and that each node Ni is positioned at pi(x, y, z). To obtain pi(x, y, z), a Spotlight localization system needs to support three main functions, namely an Event Distribution Function (EDF) E(t), an Event Detection Function D(e), and a Localization Function L(Ti). They are formally defined as follows: Definition 1: An event e(t, p) is a detectable phenomenon that occurs at time t and at point p є A. Examples of events are light, heat, smoke, sound, etc. Let Ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} be a set of n timestamps of events detected by a node i. Let T={t1, t2, …, tm} be the set of m timestamps of events generated in the sensor field. Definition 2: The Event Detection Function D(e) defines a binary detection algorithm. For a given event e: ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = detectednotisEventfalse, detectedisEventtrue, )( e e eD (1) Definition 3: The Event Distribution Function (EDF) E(t) defines the point distribution of events within A at time t: }{ truepteDApptE =∧∈= )),((|)( (2) Definition 4: The Localization Function L(Ti) defines a localization algorithm with input Ti, a sequence of timestamps of events detected by the node i: I iTt i tETL ∈ = )()( (3) Figure 2. Spotlight system architecture As shown in Figure 2, the Event Detection Function D(e) is supported by the sensor nodes. It is used to determine whether an external event happens or not. It can be implemented through either a simple threshold-based detection algorithm or other advanced digital signal processing techniques. The Event Distribution E(t) and Localization Functions L(Ti) are implemented by a Spotlight device. The Localization function is an aggregation algorithm which calculates the intersection of multiple sets of points. The Event Distribution Function E(t) describes the distribution of events over time. It is the core of the Spotlight system and it is much more sophisticated than the other two functions. Due to the fact that E(t) is realized by the Spotlight device, the hardware requirements for the sensor nodes remain minimal. With the support of these three functions, the localization process goes as follows: 1) A Spotlight device distributes events in the space A over a period of time. 2) During the event distribution, sensor nodes record the time sequence Ti = {ti1, ti2, …, tin} at which they detect the events. 3) After the event distribution, each sensor node sends the detection time sequence back to the Spotlight device. 4) The Spotlight device estimates the location of a sensor node i, using the time sequence Ti and the known E(t) function. The Event Distribution Function E(t) is the core technique used in the Spotlight system and we propose three designs for it. These designs have different tradeoffs and the cost comparison is presented in Section 3.5. 3.2 Point Scan Event Distribution Function To illustrate the basic functionality of a Spotlight system, we start with a simple sensor system where a set of nodes are placed along a straight line (A = [0, l] R). The Spotlight device generates point events (e.g. light spots) along this line with constant speed s. The set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is Ti={ti1}. The Event Distribution Function E(t) is: ⊂ }{ stpApptE *)( =∧∈= (4) where t ∈[0, l/s]. The resulting localization function is: }{ sttETL iii ∗== 11 )()( (5) where D(e(ti1, pi)) = true for node i positioned at pi. The implementation of the Event Distribution Function E(t) is straightforward. As shown in Figure 3(a), when a light source emits a beam of light with the angular speed given by d s dt d S )(cos 2 αα α == , a light spot event with constant speed s is generated along the line situated at distance d. Figure 3. The implementation of the Point Scan EDF The Point Scan EDF can be generalized to the case where nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane R2 . In this case, the Spotlight system progressively scans the plane to activate the sensor nodes. This scenario is depicted in Figure 3(b). 3.3 Line Scan Event Distribution Function Some devices, e.g. diode lasers, can generate an entire line of events simultaneously. With these devices, we can support the Line Scan Event Distributed Function easily. We assume that the 15 sensor nodes are placed in a two dimensional plane (A=[l x l] ⊂R2 ) and that the scanning speed is s. The set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is Ti={ti1, ti2}. Figure 4. The implementation of the Line Scan EDF The Line Scan EDF is defined as follows: ( ){ ks,*tpl][0,kp(t)E kkx =∧∈= } for t ∈[0, l/s] and: ({ ls*tk,pl][0,kp(t)E kky −=∧∈= )} (6) for t ∈[ l/s, 2l/s]. U )()()( tEtEtE yx= We can localize a node by calculating the intersection of the two event lines, as shown in Figure 4. More formally: I )()()( 21 iii tEtETL = (7) where D(e(ti1, pi)) = true, D(e(ti2, pi)) = true for node i positioned at pi. 3.4 Area Cover Event Distribution Function Other devices, such as light projectors, can generate events that cover an area. This allows the implementation of the Area Cover EDF. The idea of Area Cover EDF is to partition the space A into multiple sections and assign a unique binary identifier, called code, to each section. Lets suppose that the localization is done within a plane (A R2 ). Each section Sk within A has a unique code k. The Area Cover EDF is then defined as follows: ⊂ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = 0iskofbitjthiffalse, 1iskofbitjthiftrue, ),( jkBIT (8) }{ truetkBITSpptE k =∧∈= ),()( and the corresponding localization algorithm is: { ∧∈=∧== )),(()(|)( iki TtiftruetkBITSCOGppTL (9)})`),(( iTTtiffalsetkBIT −∈= where COG(Sk) denotes the center of gravity of Sk. We illustrate the Area Cover EDF with a simple example. As shown in Figure 5, the plane A is divided in 16 sections. Each section Sk has a unique code k. The Spotlight device distributes the events according to these codes: at time j a section Sk is covered by an event (lit by light), if jth bit of k is 1. A node residing anywhere in the section Sk is localized at the center of gravity of that section. For example, nodes within section 1010 detect the events at time T = {1, 3}. At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase. Considering the noise that is present in a real, outdoor environment, it is easy to observe that a relatively small error in detecting the correct bit pattern could result in a large localization error. Returning to the example shown in Figure 5, if a sensor node is located in the section with code 0000, and due to the noise, at time t = 3, it thinks it detected an event, it will incorrectly conclude that its code is 1000, and it positions itself two squares below its correct position. The localization accuracy can deteriorate even further, if multiple errors are present in the transmission of the code. A natural solution to this problem is to use error-correcting codes, which greatly reduce the probability of an error, without paying the price of a re-transmission, or lengthening the transmission time too much. Several error correction schemes have been proposed in the past. Two of the most notable ones are the Hamming (7, 4) code and the Golay (23, 12) code. Both are perfect linear error correcting codes. The Hamming coding scheme can detect up to 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors. In the Hamming (7, 4) scheme, a message having 4 bits of data (e.g. dddd, where d is a data bit) is transmitted as a 7-bit word by adding 3 error control bits (e.g. dddpdpp, where p is a parity bit). Figure 5. The steps of Area Cover EDF. The events cover the shaded areas. The steps of the Area Cover technique, when using Hamming (7, 4) scheme are shown in Figure 6. Golay codes can detect up to 6-bit errors and correct up to 3-bit errors. Similar to Hamming (7, 4), Golay constructs a 23-bit codeword from 12-bit data. Golay codes have been used in satellite and spacecraft data transmission and are most suitable in cases where short codeword lengths are desirable. Figure 6. The steps of Area Cover EDF with Hamming (7, 4) ECC. The events cover the shaded areas. Lets assume a 1-bit error probability of 0.01, and a 12-bit message that needs to be transmitted. The probability of a failed transmission is thus: 0.11, if no error detection and correction is used; 0.0061 for the Hamming scheme (i.e. more than 1-bit error); and 0.000076 for the Golay scheme (i.e. more than 3-bit errors). Golay is thus 80 times more robust that the Hamming scheme, which is 20 times more robust than the no error correction scheme. 16 Considering that a limited number of corrections is possible by any coding scheme, a natural question arises: can we minimize the localization error when there are errors that can not be corrected? This can be achieved by a clever placement of codes in the grid. As shown in Figure 7, the placement A, in the presence of a 1-bit error has a smaller average localization error when compared to the placement B. The objective of our code placement strategy is to reduce the total Euclidean distance between all pairs of codes with Hamming distances smaller than K, the largest number of expected 1-bit errors. Figure 7. Different code placement strategies Formally, a placement is represented by a function P: [0, l]d → C, which assigns a code to every coordinate in the d-dimensional cube of size l (e.g., in the planar case, we place codes in a 2dimensional grid). We denote by dE(i, j) the Euclidean distance and by dH(i, j) the Hamming distance between two codes i and j. In a noisy environment, dH(i,j) determines the crossover probability between the two codes. For the case of independent detections, the higher dH(i, j) is, the lower the crossover probability will be. The objective function is defined as follows: d Kjid E ljiwherejid H ],0[,}),(min{ ),( ∈∑≤ (10) Equation 10 is a non-linear and non-convex programming problem. In general, it is analytically hard to obtain the global minimum. To overcome this, we propose a Greedy Placement method to obtain suboptimal results. In this method we initialize the 2-dimensional grid with codes. Then we swap the codes within the grid repeatedly, to minimize the objective function. For each swap, we greedily chose a pair of codes, which can reduce the objective function (Equation 10) the most. The proposed Greedy Placement method ends when no swap of codes can further minimize the objective function. For evaluation, we compared the average localization error in the presence of K-bit error for two strategies: the proposed Greedy Placement and the Row-Major Placement (it places the codes consecutively in the array, in row-first order). 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 Grid Size LocalizationError[gridunit] Row-major Consecutive placement Greedy Placement Figure 8. Localization error with code placement and no ECC As Figure 8 shows, if no error detection/correction capability is present and 1-bit errors occur, then our Greedy Placement method can reduce the localization error by an average 23%, when compared to the Row-Major Placement. If error detection and correction schemes are used (e.g. Hamming (12, 8) and if 3-bit errors occur (K=3) then the Greedy Placement method reduces localization error by 12%, when compared to the Row-Major Placement, as shown in Figure 9. If K=1, then there is no benefit in using the Greedy Placement method, since the 1-bit error can be corrected by the Hamming scheme. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 Grid Size LocalizationError[gridunit] Row-major Consecutive placement Greedy Placement Figure 9. Localization error with code placement and Hamming ECC 3.5 Event Distribution Function Analysis Although all three aforementioned techniques are able to localize the sensor nodes, they differ in the localization time, communication overhead and energy consumed by the Event Distribution Function (lets call it Event Overhead). Lets assume that all sensor nodes are located in a square with edge size D, and that the Spotlight device can generate N events (e.g. Point, Line and Area Cover events) every second and that the maximum tolerable localization error is r. Table 1 presents the execution cost comparison of the three different Spotlight techniques. Table 1. Execution Cost Comparison Criterion Point Scan Line Scan Area Cover Localization Time NrD /)/( 22 NrD /)/2( NDlogr / # Detections 1 2 logrD # Time Stamps 1 2 logrD Event Overhead D2 2D2 D2 logrD/2 Table 1 indicates that the Event Overhead for the Point Scan method is the smallest - it requires a one-time coverage of the area, hence the D2 . However the Point Scan takes a much longer time than the Area Cover technique, which finishes in logrD seconds. The Line Scan method trades the Event Overhead well with the localization time. By doubling the Event Overhead, the Line Scan method takes only r/2D percentage of time to complete, when compared with the Point Scan method. From Table 1, it can be observed that the execution costs do not depend on the number of sensor nodes to be localized. It is important to remark the ratio Event Overhead per unit time, which is indicative of the power requirement for the Spotlight device. This ratio is constant for the Point Scan (r2 *N) while it grows linearly with area, for the Area Cover (D2 *N/2). If the deployment area is very large, the use of the Area Cover EDF is prohibitively expensive, if not impossible. For practical purposes, the Area Cover is a viable solution for small to medium size networks, while the Line Scan works well for large networks. We discuss the implications of the power requirement for the Spotlight device, and offer a hybrid solution in Section 6. 3.6 Localization Error Analysis The accuracy of localization with the Spotlight technique depends on many aspects. The major factors that were considered during the implementation of the system are discussed below: 17 - Time Synchronization: the Spotlight system exchanges time stamps between sensor nodes and the Spotlight device. It is necessary for the system to reach consensus on global time through synchronization. Due to the uncertainty in hardware processing and wireless communication, we can only confine such errors within certain bounds (e.g. one jiffy). An imprecise input to the Localization Function L(T) leads to an error in node localization. - Uncertainty in Detection: the sampling rate of the sensor nodes is finite, consequently, there will be an unpredictable delay between the time when an event is truly present and when the sensor node detects it. Lower sampling rates will generate larger localizations errors. - Size of the Event: the events distributed by the Spotlight device can not be infinitely small. If a node detects one event, it is hard for it to estimate the exact location of itself within the event. - Realization of Event Distribution Function: EDF defines locations of events at time t. Due to the limited accuracy (e.g. mechanical imprecision), a Spotlight device might generate events which locate differently from where these events are supposed to be. It is important to remark that the localization error is independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network. This independence, as well as the aforementioned independence of the execution cost, indicate the very good scalability properties (with the number of sensor nodes, but not with the area of deployment) that the Spotlight system possesses. 4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION For our performance evaluation we implemented two Spotlight systems. Using these two implementations we were able to investigate the full spectrum of Event Distribution techniques, proposed in Section 3, at a reduced one time cost (less than $1,000). The first implementation, called μSpotlight, had a short range (10-20 meters), however its capability of generating the entire spectrum of EDFs made it very useful. We used this implementation mainly to investigate the capabilities of the Spotlight system and tune its performance. It was not intended to represent the full solution, but only a scaled down version of the system. The second implementation, the Spotlight system, had a much longer range (as far as 6500m), but it was limited in the types of EDFs that it can generate. The goal of this implementation was to show how the Spotlight system works in a real, outdoor environment, and show correlations with the experimental results obtained from the μSpotlight system implementation. In the remaining part of this section, we describe how we implemented the three components (Event Distribution, Event Detection and Localization functions) of the Spotlight architecture, and the time synchronization protocol, a key component of our system. 4.1 µSpotlight System The first system we built, called μSpotlight, used as the Spotlight device, an Infocus LD530 projector connected to an IBM Thinkpad laptop. The system is shown in Figure 10. The Event Distribution Function was implemented as a Java GUI. Due to the stringent timing requirements and the delay caused by the buffering in the windowing system of a PC, we used the Full-Screen Exclusive Mode API provided by Java2. This allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector, hence a higher accuracy of timestamps of events. Because of the 50Hz refresh rate of our projector, there was still an uncertainty in the time stamping of the events of 20msec. We explored the possibility of using and modifying the Linux kernel to expose the vertical synch (VSYNCH) interrupt, generated by the displaying device after each screen refresh, out of the kernel mode. The performance evaluation results showed, however, that this level of accuracy was not needed. The sensor nodes that we used were Berkeley Mica2 motes equipped with MTS310 multi-sensor boards from Crossbow. This sensor board contains a CdSe photo sensor which can detect the light from the projector. Figure 10. μSpotlight system implementation With this implementation of the Spotlight system, we were able to generate Point, Line and Area Scan events. 4.2 Spotlight System The second Spotlight system we built used, as the Spotlight device, diode lasers, a computerized telescope mount (Celestron CG-5GT, shown in Figure 11), and an IBM Thinkpad laptop. The laptop was connected, through RS232 interfaces, to the telescope mount and to one XSM600CA [7] mote, acting as a base station. The diode lasers we used ranged in power from 7mW to 35mW. They emitted at 650nm, close to the point of highest sensitivity for CdSe photosensor. The diode lasers were equipped with lenses that allowed us to control the divergence of the beam. Figure 11. Spotlight system implementation The telescope mount has worm gears for a smooth motion and high precision angular measurements. The two angular measures that we used were the, so called, Alt (from Altitude) and Az (from Azimuth). In astronomy, the Altitude of a celestial object is its angular distance above or below the celestial horizon, and the Azimuth is the angular distance of an object eastwards of the meridian, along the horizon. 18 The laptop computer, through a Java GUI, controls the motion of the telescope mount, orienting it such that a full Point Scan of an area is performed, similar to the one described in Figure 3(b). For each turning point i, the 3-tuple (Alti and Azi angles and the timestamp ti) is recorded. The Spotlight system uses the timestamp received from a sensor node j, to obtain the angular measures Altj and Azj for its location. For the sensor nodes, we used XSM motes, mainly because of their longer communication range. The XSM mote has the photo sensor embedded in its main board. We had to make minor adjustments to the plastic housing, in order to expose the photo sensor to the outside. The same mote code, written in nesC, for TinyOS, was used for both µSpotlight and Spotlight system implementations. 4.3 Event Detection Function D(t) The Event Detection Function aims to detect the beginning of an event and record the time when the event was observed. We implemented a very simple detection function based on the observed maximum value. An event i will be time stamped with time ti, if the reading from the photo sensor dti, fulfills the condition: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor before ti and Δ is a constant which ensures that the first large detection gives the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variations around the first large signal are not considered). Hence Δ guarantees that only sharp changes in the detected value generate an observed event. 4.4 Localization Function L(T) The Localization Function is implemented in the Java GUI. It matches the timestamps created by the Event Distribution Function with those reported by the sensor nodes. The Localization Function for the Point Scan EDF has as input a time sequence Ti = {t1}, as reported by node i. The function performs a simple search for the event with a timestamp closest to t1. If t1 is constrained by: 11 + << nn ee ttt where en and en+1 are two consecutive events, then the obtained location for node i is: 11 , ++ == nn ee yyxx The case for the Line Scan is treated similarly. The input to the Localization Function is the time sequence Ti = {t1, t2} as reported by node i. If the reported timestamps are constrained by: 11 + << nn ee ttt , and 12 + << mm ee ttt where en and en+1 are two consecutive events on the horizontal scan and em and em+1 are two consecutive events on vertical scan, then the inferred location for node i is: 11 , ++ == mn ee yyxx The Localization Function for the Area Cover EDF has as input a timestamp set Ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} of the n events, detected by node i. We recall the notation for the set of m timestamps of events generated by the Spotlight device, T={t1, t2, …, tm}. A code di=di1di2…dim is then constructed for each node i, such that dij=1 if tj ∈Ti and dij=0 if tj ∉ Ti. The function performs a search for an event with an identical code. If the following condition is true: nei dd = where en is an event with code den, then the inferred location for node i is: nn ee yyxx == , 4.5 Time Synchronization The time synchronization in the Spotlight system consists of two parts: - Synchronization between sensor nodes: This is achieved through the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol [18]. In this protocol, synchronized nodes (the root node is the only synchronized node at the beginning) send time synchronization message to unsynchronized nodes. The sender puts the time stamp into the synchronization message right before the bytes containing the time stamp are transmitted. Once a receiver gets the message, it follows the senders time and performs the necessary calculations to compensate for the clock drift. - Synchronization between the sensor nodes and the Spotlight device: We implemented this part through a two-way handshaking between the Spotlight device and one node, used as the base station. The sensor node is attached to the Spotlight device through a serial interface. Figure 12. Two-way synchronization As shown in Figure 12, lets assume that the Spotlight device sends a synchronization message (SYNC) at local time T1, the sensor node receives it at its local time T2 and acknowledges it at local time T3 (both T2 and T3 are sent back through ACK). After the Spotlight device receives the ACK, at its local time T4, the time synchronization can be achieved as follows: 2 )()( 4312 TTTT Offset −+− = (11) OffsetTTT spotlightnodeglobal +== We note that Equation 11 assumes that the one trip delays are the same in both directions. In practice this does not hold well enough. To improve the performance, we separate the handshaking process from the timestamp exchanges. The handshaking is done fast, through a 2 byte exchange between the Spotlight device and the sensor node (the timestamps are still recorded, but not sent). After this fast handshaking, the recorded time stamps are exchanged. The result indicates that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of time synchronization. 5. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section we present the performance evaluation of the Spotlight systems when using the three event distribution functions, i.e. Point Scan, Line Scan and Area Cover, described in Section 3. 19 For the µSpotlight system we used 10 Mica2 motes. The sensor nodes were attached to a vertically positioned Veltex board. By projecting the light to the sensor nodes, we are able to generate well controlled Point, Line and Area events. The Spotlight device was able to generate events, i.e. project light patterns, covering an area of approximate size 180x140cm2 . The screen resolution for the projector was 1024x768, and the movement of the Point Scan and Line Scan techniques was done through increments (in the appropriate direction) of 10 pixels between events. Each experimental point was obtained from 10 successive runs of the localization procedure. Each set of 10 runs was preceded by a calibration phase, aimed at estimating the total delays (between the Spotlight device and each sensor node) in detecting an event. During the calibration, we created an event covering the entire sensor field (illuminated the entire area). The timestamp reported by each sensor node, in conjunction with the timestamp created by the Spotlight device were used to obtain the time offset, for each sensor node. More sophisticated calibration procedures have been reported previously [35]. In addition to the time offset, we added a manually configurable parameter, called bias. It was used to best estimate the center of an event. Figure 13. Deployment site for the Spotlight system For the Spotlight system evaluation, we deployed 10 XSM motes in a football field. The site is shown in Figure 13 (laser beams are depicted with red arrows and sensor nodes with white dots). Two sets of experiments were run, with the Spotlight device positioned at 46m and at 170m from the sensor field. The sensor nodes were aligned and the Spotlight device executed a Point Scan. The localization system computed the coordinates of the sensor nodes, and the Spotlight device was oriented, through a GoTo command sent to the telescope mount, towards the computed location. In the initial stages of the experiments, we manually measured the localization error. For our experimental evaluation, the metrics of interest were as follows: - Localization error, defined as the distance, between the real location and the one obtained from the Spotlight system. - Localization duration, defined as the time span between the first and last event. - Localization range, defined as the maximum distance between the Spotlight device and the sensor nodes. - A Localization Cost function Cost:{{localization accuracy}, {localization duration}} → [0,1] quantifies the trade-off between the accuracy in localization and the localization duration. The objective is to minimize the Localization Cost function. By denoting with ei the localization error for the ith scenario, with di the localization duration for the ith scenario, with max(e) the maximum localization error, with max(d) the maximum localization duration, and with α the importance factor, the Localization Cost function is formally defined as: )max( )1( )max( ),( d d e e deCost ii ii ∗−+∗= αα - Localization Bias. This metric is used to investigate the effectiveness of the calibration procedure. If, for example, all computed locations have a bias in the west direction, a calibration factor can be used to compensate for the difference. The parameters that we varied during the performance evaluation of our system were: the type of scanning (Point, Line and Area), the size of the event, the duration of the event (for Area Cover), the scanning speed, the power of the laser and the distance between the Spotlight device and sensor field, to estimate the range of the system. 5.1 Point Scan - μSpotlight system In this experiment, we investigated how the size of the event and the scanning speed affect the localization error. Figure 14 shows the mean localization errors with their standard deviations. It can be observed, that while the scanning speed, varying between 35cm/sec and 87cm/sec has a minor influence on the localization accuracy, the size of the event has a dramatic effect. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 21.0 24.5 Event Size [cm] Locationerror[cm] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 14. Localization Error vs. Event Size for the Point Scan EDF The obtained localization error varied from as little as 2cm to over 11cm for the largest event. This dependence can be explained by our Event Detection algorithm: the first detection above a threshold gave the timestamp for the event. The duration of the localization scheme is shown in Figure 15. The dependency of the localization duration on the size of the event and scanning speed is natural. A bigger event allows a reduction in the total duration of up to 70%. The localization duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed, as expected, and depicted in Figure 15. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 21.0 24.5 Event Size [cm] LocalizationDuration[sec] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 15. Localization Duration vs. Event Size for the Point Scan EDF 20 An interesting trade-off is between the localization accuracy (usually the most important factor), and the localization time (important in environments where stealthiness is paramount). Figure 16 shows the Localization Cost function, for α = 0.5 (accuracy and duration are equally important). As shown in Figure 16, it can be observed that an event size of approximately 10-15cm (depending on the scanning speed) minimizes our Cost function. For α = 1, the same graph would be a monotonically increasing function, while for α = 0, it would be monotonically decreasing function. 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 Event Size [cm] LocalizationCost[%] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 16. Localization Cost vs. Event Size for the Point Scan EDF 5.2 Line Scan - μSpotlight system In a similar manner to the Point Scan EDF, for the Line Scan EDF we were interested in the dependency of the localization error and duration on the size of the event and scanning speed. We represent in Figure 17 the localization error for different event sizes. It is interesting to observe the dependency (concave shape) of the localization error vs. the event size. Moreover, a question that should arise is why the same dependency was not observed in the case of Point Scan EDF. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Event Size [cm] Locationerror[cm] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 17. Localization Error vs. Event Size for the Line Scan EDF The explanation for this concave dependency is the existence of a bias in location estimation. As a reminder, a bias factor was introduced in order to best estimate the central point of events that have a large size. What Figure 17 shows is the fact that the bias factor was optimal for an event size of approximately 7cm. For events smaller and larger than this, the bias factor was too large, and too small, respectively. Thus, it introduced biased errors in the position estimation. The reason why we did not observe the same dependency in the case of the Point Scan EDF was that we did not experiment with event sizes below 7cm, due to the long time it would have taken to scan the entire field with events as small as 1.7cm. The results for the localization duration as a function of the size of the event are shown in Figure 18. As shown, the localization duration is directly proportional to the scanning speed. The size of the event has a smaller influence on the localization duration. One can remark the average localization duration of about 10sec, much shorter then the duration obtained in the Point Scan experiment. The Localization Cost function dependency on the event size and scanning speed, for α=0.5, is shown in Figure 19. The dependency on the scanning speed is very small (the Cost Function achieves a minimum in the same 4-6cm range). It is interesting to note that this 4-6cm optimal event size is smaller than the one observed in the case of Point Scan EDF. The explanation for this is that the smaller localization duration observed in the Line Scan EDF, allowed a shift (towards smaller event sizes) in the total Localization Cost Function. 0 5 10 15 20 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Event Size [cm] LocalizationDuration[sec] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 18.

Cost Function vs. Event Size for the Line Scan EDF During our experiments with the Line Scan EDF, we observed evidence of a bias in location estimation. The estimated locations for all sensor nodes exhibited different biases, for different event sizes. For example, for an event size of 17.5cm, the estimated location for sensor nodes was to the upper-left size of the actual location. This was equivalent to an early detection, since our scanning was done from left to right and from top to bottom. The scanning speed did not influence the bias. In order to better understand the observed phenomena, we analyzed our data. Figure 20 shows the bias in the horizontal direction, for different event sizes (the vertical bias was almost identical, and we omit it, due to space constraints). From Figure 20, one can observe that the smallest observed bias, and hence the most accurate positioning, was for an event of size 7cm. These results are consistent with the observed localization error, shown in Figure 17. We also adjusted the measured localization error (shown in Figure 17) for the observed bias (shown in Figure 20). The results of an ideal case of Spotlight Localization system with Line Scan EDF are shown in Figure 21. The errors are remarkably small, varying between 0.1cm and 0.8cm, with a general trend of higher localization errors for larger event sizes. 21 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Event Size [cm] HorizontalBias[cm] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/sec 35cm/sec Figure 20.

Position Estimation w/o Bias (ideal), for the Line Scan EDF 5.3 Area Cover - μSpotlight system In this experiment, we investigated how the number of bits used to quantify the entire sensor field, affected the localization accuracy. In our first experiment we did not use error correcting codes. The results are shown in Figure 22. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 6 8 10 12 Number of Bits Locationerror[cm] 20ms/event 40ms/event 60ms/event 80ms/event 100ms/event Figure 22. Localization Error vs. Event Size for the Area Cover EDF One can observe a remarkable accuracy, with localization error on the order of 0.3-0.6cm. What is important to observe is the variance in the localization error. In the scenario where 12 bits were used, while the average error was very small, there were a couple of cases, where an incorrect event detection generated a larger than expected error. An example of how this error can occur was described in Section 3.4. The experimental results, presented in Figure 22, emphasize the need for error correction of the bit patterns observed and reported by the sensor nodes. The localization duration results are shown in Figure 23. It can be observed that the duration is directly proportional with the number of bits used, with total durations ranging from 3sec, for the least accurate method, to 6-7sec for the most accurate. The duration of an event had a small influence on the total localization time, when considering the same scenario (same number of bits for the code). The Cost Function dependency on the number of bits in the code, for α=0.5, is shown in Figure 24. Generally, since the localization duration for the Area Scan can be extremely small, a higher accuracy in the localization is desired. While the Cost function achieves a minimum when 10 bits are used, we attribute the slight increase observed when 12 bits were used to the two 12bit scenarios where larger than the expected errors were observed, namely 6-7mm (as shown in Figure 22). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6 8 10 12 Number of Bits LocalizationDuration[sec] 20ms/event 40ms/event 60ms/event 80ms/event 100ms/event Figure 23.

Localization Error w/ and w/o Error Correction The two problematic scenarios (shown in Figure 22, where for 12-bit codes we observed errors larger than the event size, due to errors in detection) were further explored by using error correction codes. As described in Section 3.3, we implemented an extended Golay (24, 12) error correction mechanism in our location estimation algorithm. The experimental results are depicted in Figure 25, and show a consistent accuracy. The scenario without error correction codes, is simply the same 12-bit code scenario, shown in Figure 22. We only investigated the 12-bit scenario, due to its match with the 12bit data required by the Golay encoding scheme (extended Golay producing 24-bit codewords). 22 5.4 Point Scan - Spotlight system In this section we describe the experiments performed at a football stadium, using our Spotlight system. The hardware that we had available allowed us to evaluate the Point Scan technique of the Spotlight system. In our evaluation, we were interested to see the performance of the system at different ranges. Figures 26 and 27 show the localization error versus the event size at two different ranges: 46m and 170m. Figure 26 shows a remarkable accuracy in localization. The errors are in the centimeter range. Our initial, manual measurements of the localization error were most of the time difficult to make, since the spot of the laser was almost perfectly covering the XSM mote. We are able to achieve localization errors of a few centimeters, which only range-based localization schemes are able to achieve [25]. The observed dependency on the size of the event is similar to the one observed in the μSpotlight system evaluation, and shown in Figure 14. This proved that the μSpotlight system is a viable alternative for investigating complex EDFs, without incurring the costs for the necessary hardware. 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Event Size [cm] LocalizationError[cm] 0.41m/sec 0.81m/sec 1.7m/sec Figure 26. Localization Error vs. Event Size for Spotlight system at 46m In the experiments performed over a much longer distance between the Spotlight device and sensor network, the average localization error remains very small. Localization errors of 510cm were measured, as Figure 27 shows. We were simply amazed by the accuracy that the system is capable of, when considering that the Spotlight system operated over the length of a football stadium. Throughout our experimentation with the Spotlight system, we have observed localization errors that were simply offsets of real locations. Since the same phenomenon was observed when experimenting with the μSpotlight system, we believe that with auto-calibration, the localization error can be further reduced. 0 5 10 15 20 25 6 12 18 Event Size [cm] LocalizationError[cm] 0.7m/sec 1.4m/sec 3m/sec Figure 27. Localization Error vs. Event Size for Spotlight system at 170m The time required for localization using the Spotlight system with a Point Scan EDF, is given by: t=(L*l)/(s*Es), where L and l are the dimensions of the sensor network field, s is the scanning speed, and Es is the size of the event. Figure 28 shows the time for localizing a sensor network deployed in an area of size of a football field using the Spotlight system. Here we ignore the message propagation time, from the sensor nodes to the Spotlight device. From Figure 28 it can be observed that the very small localization errors are prohibitively expensive in the case of the Point Scan. When localization errors of up to 1m are tolerable, localization duration can be as low as 4 minutes. Localization durations of 5-10 minutes, and localization errors of 1m are currently state of art in the realm of range-free localization schemes. And these results are achieved by using the Point Scan scheme, which required the highest Localization Time, as it was shown in Table 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Event Size [cm] LocalizationTime[min] 3m/sec 6m/sec 9m/sec Figure 28. Localization Time vs. Event Size for Spotlight system One important characteristic of the Spotlight system is its range. The two most important factors are the sensitivity of the photosensor and the power of the Spotlight source. We were interested in measuring the range of our Spotlight system, considering our capabilities (MTS310 sensor board and inexpensive, $12-$85, diode laser). As a result, we measured the intensity of the laser beam, having the same focus, at different distances. The results are shown in Figure 29. 950 1000 1050 1100 0 50 100 150 200 Distance [m] Intensity[ADCcount] 35mW 7mW Figure 29. Localization Range for the Spotlight system From Figure 29, it can be observed that only a minor decrease in the intensity occurs, due to absorption and possibly our imperfect focusing of the laser beam. A linear fit of the experimental data shows that distances of up to 6500m can be achieved. While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can easily be achieved. The angle between the laser beam and the vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual projection of the beam on the ground. In a similar manner, we were interested in finding out the maximum size of an event, that can be generated by a COTS laser and that is detectable by the existing photosensor. For this, we 23 varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light intensity, as given by the ADC count. The results are shown in Figure 30. It can be observed that for the less powerful laser, an event size of 1.5m is the limit. For the more powerful laser, the event size can be as high as 4m. Through our extensive performance evaluation results, we have shown that the Spotlight system is a feasible, highly accurate, low cost solution for localization of wireless sensor networks. From our experience with sources of laser radiation, we believe that for small and medium size sensor network deployments, in areas of less than 20,000m2 , the Area Cover scheme is a viable solution. For large size sensor network deployments, the Line Scan, or an incremental use of the Area Cover are very good options. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 Event Size [cm] Intensity[ADCcount] 35mW 7mW Figure 30. Detectable Event Sizes that can be generated by COTS lasers 6. OPTIMIZATIONS/LESSONS LEARNED 6.1 Distributed Spotlight System The proposed design and the implementation of the Spotlight system can be considered centralized, due to the gathering of the sensor data and the execution of the Localization Function L(t) by the Spotlight device. We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions. One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function. For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed). A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions. In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection. Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network. Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective. The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place. If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt. Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes. An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform. One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time. An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically. The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes. The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density. A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area). In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network. Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events. Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise. The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system). While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system. Figure 31. Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor. The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom). As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm. Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present. A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm. For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light. A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation. The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown. While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain. A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure. In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system. The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3). This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain. By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases. For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor. In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight. Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists. All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device. Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network. Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm. This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31]. As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system. The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported. A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.

    "original_translation": "Un sistema de localización de alto costo de alta aceptación para redes de sensores inalámbricos Radu Stoleru, Tian He, John A. Stankovic, David Luebke Departamento de Ciencias de la Computación Universidad de Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 {Stoleru, Tianhe, Stankovic, Luebke} @CS.Virginia.edu Resumen El problema de la localización de los nodos de sensores inalámbricos se ha considerado muy difícil de resolver, al considerar las realidades de los entornos del mundo real. En este artículo, describimos, diseñamos, implementamos y evaluamos formalmente un nuevo sistema de localización, llamado Spotlight. Nuestro sistema utiliza las propiedades espacio-temporales de eventos bien controlados en la red (por ejemplo, luz), para obtener las ubicaciones de los nodos sensores. Demostramos que se puede lograr una alta precisión en la localización sin la ayuda de hardware costoso en los nodos del sensor, como lo requiere otros sistemas de localización. Evaluamos el rendimiento de nuestro sistema en implementaciones de MICA2 y XSM Motes. A través de evaluaciones de rendimiento de un sistema real implementado al aire libre, obtenemos un error de localización de 20 cm. Una red de sensores, con cualquier cantidad de nodos, implementado en un área de 2500m2, se puede localizar en menos de 10 minutos, utilizando un dispositivo que cuesta menos de $ 1000. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer informe de un error de localización del subméter, obtenido en un entorno al aire libre, sin equipar los nodos del sensor inalámbrico con hardware de rango especializado.

Algoritmos de términos generales, medición, rendimiento, diseño, experimentación 1. Introducción Recientemente, los sistemas de red de sensores inalámbricos se han utilizado en muchas aplicaciones prometedoras, incluida la vigilancia militar, el monitoreo del hábitat, el seguimiento de la vida silvestre, etc. [12] [22] [33] [36]. Si bien muchos servicios de middleware, para apoyar estas aplicaciones, se han diseñado e implementado con éxito, la localización, encontrar la posición de los nodos sensores, sigue siendo uno de los desafíos de investigación más difíciles que se resuelven prácticamente. Dado que la mayoría de las aplicaciones emergentes basadas en nodos de sensores en red requieren conciencia de ubicación para ayudar a sus operaciones, como la anotación de datos detectados con el contexto de ubicación, es un requisito indispensable para que un nodo sensor pueda encontrar su propia ubicación. Se han propuesto muchos enfoques en la literatura [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], sin embargo, todavía no está claro cómo pueden ser estas solucionesImplementado prácticamente y económicamente. Un GPS a bordo [23] es una solución típica de alta gama, que requiere un hardware sofisticado para lograr una sincronización de tiempo de alta resolución con satélites. Las restricciones sobre la potencia y el costo de los nodos de sensores pequeños impiden esto como una solución viable. Otras soluciones requieren dispositivos por nodo que puedan realizar un rango entre los nodos vecinos. Las dificultades de estos enfoques son dobles. Primero, bajo restricciones de factor de forma y fuente de alimentación, los rangos efectivos de tales dispositivos son muy limitados. Por ejemplo, el rango efectivo de los transductores ultrasónicos utilizados en el sistema de cricket es inferior a 2 metros cuando el remitente y el receptor no se enfrentan entre sí [26]. En segundo lugar, dado que la mayoría de los nodos de sensores son estáticos, es decir, no se espera que la ubicación cambie, no es rentable equipar estos sensores con circuitos especiales solo para una localización única. Para superar estas limitaciones, se han propuesto muchos esquemas de localización sin rango. La mayoría de estos esquemas estiman la ubicación de los nodos sensores al explotar la información de conectividad de radio entre los nodos vecinos. Estos enfoques eliminan la necesidad de hardware especializado de alto costo, a costa de una localización menos precisa. Además, las características de propagación de la radio varían con el tiempo y dependen del medio ambiente, lo que impuso altos costos de calibración para los esquemas de localizaciones sin rango. Con tales limitaciones en mente, este documento aborda el siguiente desafío de investigación: cómo conciliar la necesidad de una alta precisión en la estimación de ubicación con el costo de lograrlo. Nuestra respuesta a este desafío es un sistema de localización llamado Spotlight. Este sistema emplea una arquitectura asimétrica, en la que los nodos sensores no necesitan hardware adicional, aparte de lo que tienen actualmente. Todo el hardware y el cálculo sofisticados residen en un solo dispositivo de atención. El dispositivo Spotlight utiliza una fuente de luz láser orientable, iluminando los nodos del sensor colocados dentro de un terreno conocido. Demostramos que esta localización es mucho más precisa (es decir, decenas de centímetros) que los esquemas de localización basados en el rango y que tiene un rango mucho más efectivo (es decir, miles de metros) que las soluciones basadas en un rango ultraidos/acústico. Al mismo tiempo, dado que solo se necesita un solo dispositivo sofisticado para localizar toda la red, el costo amortizado es mucho menor que el costo para agregar componentes de hardware a los sensores individuales.2. Trabajo relacionado En esta sección, discutimos el trabajo previo en la localización en dos categorías principales: los esquemas de localización basados en el rango (que utilizan dispositivos costosos, por nodo, de rango de alta precisión o soluciones de rango menos precisas, como el indicador de resistencia a la señal recibido(RSSI)), y los esquemas sin rango, que usan solo información de conectividad (hop-by-hop) como una indicación de proximidad entre los nodos. El problema de localización es un problema de investigación fundamental en muchos dominios. En el campo de la robótica, se ha estudiado ampliamente [9] [10]. Los errores de localización informados están en el orden de decenas de centímetros, cuando se utilizan hardware de rango especializado, es decir, buscador de rango láser o ultrasonido. Debido al alto costo y al factor de forma no desplegable del hardware de rango, estas soluciones no se pueden aplicar simplemente a las redes de sensores. El RSSI ha sido una solución atractiva para estimar la distancia entre el remitente y el receptor. El sistema de radar [2] utiliza el RSSI para construir un repositorio centralizado de fuerzas de señal en varias posiciones con respecto a un conjunto de nodos de baliza. La ubicación de un usuario móvil se estima en unos pocos metros. En un enfoque similar, Motetrack [17] distribuye los valores RSSI de referencia a los nodos de baliza. También se han propuesto soluciones que usan RSSI y no requieren nodos de baliza [5] [14] [24] [26] [29]. Todos comparten la idea de usar una baliza móvil. Los nodos sensores que reciben las balizas, aplican diferentes algoritmos para inferir su ubicación. En [29], Sichitiu propone una solución en la que los nodos que reciben la construcción de baliza, según el valor RSSI, una restricción en su estimación de posición. En [26], Priyantha et al.Proponga MAL, un método de localización en el que un nodo móvil (que se mueve estratégicamente) ayuda a medir distancias entre los pares de nodos, hasta que las restricciones en distancias generan un gráfico rígido. En [24], Pathirana et al.Formule el problema de localización como una estimación en línea en un sistema dinámico no lineal y propone un filtro Kalman extendido robusto para resolverlo. Elnahrawy [8] proporciona una fuerte evidencia de limitaciones inherentes de precisión de localización utilizando RSSI, en entornos interiores. Una técnica de rango más precisa utiliza la diferencia de tiempo entre una señal de radio y una onda acústica, para obtener distancias de pares entre nodos sensores. Este enfoque produce errores de localización más pequeños, a costa del hardware adicional. El sistema de soporte de ubicación del cricket [25] puede lograr una granularidad de ubicación de decenas de centímetros con transceptores de ultrasonido de corto alcance. Ahlos, propuesto por Savvides et al.[27], emplea el tiempo de llegada (TOA) técnicas de rango que requieren un hardware extenso y resolver sistemas de ecuaciones no lineales relativamente grandes. Se emplea una técnica TOA similar en [3]. En [30], Simon et al.Implemente un sistema distribuido (utilizando el rango acústico) que ubica un francotirador en un terreno urbano. El rango acústico para la localización también es utilizado por Kwon et al.[15]. Los errores reportados en la localización varían de 2.2M a 9.5m, dependiendo del tipo (centralizado versus distribuido) del algoritmo de escala de mínimo cuadrado utilizado. Para las redes de sensores inalámbricos, el rango es una opción difícil. El costo del hardware, el gasto de energía, el factor de forma, el rango pequeño, todos son compromisos difíciles, y es difícil imaginar dispositivos baratos, poco confiables y de restricción de recursos que utilizan soluciones de localización basadas en el rango. Sin embargo, la alta precisión de localización, alcanzable por estos esquemas, es muy deseable. Para superar los desafíos planteados por los esquemas de localización basados en la gama, cuando se aplican a redes de sensores, se ha propuesto y evaluado un enfoque diferente en el pasado. Este enfoque se llama sin rango e intenta obtener información de ubicación de la proximidad a un conjunto de nodos de baliza conocidos. Bulusu et al.Proponer en [4] un esquema de localización, llamado centroide, en el que cada nodo se localiza en el centroide de sus nodos de baliza próximos. En [13], él et al.Proponga APIT, un esquema en el que cada nodo decide su posición en función de la posibilidad de estar dentro o fuera de un triángulo formado por tres nodos de baliza escuchados por el nodo. El sistema de coordenadas global [20], desarrollado en el MIT, utiliza el conocimiento Apriori de la densidad de nodo en la red, para estimar la distancia promedio de lúpulo. La familia DV-* de esquemas de localización [21], utiliza el recuento de saltos desde nodos de baliza conocidos hasta los nodos en la red para inferir la distancia. La mayoría de los esquemas de localización sin rango se han evaluado en simulaciones o entornos controlados. Varios estudios [11] [32] [34] han enfatizado los desafíos que plantean los entornos reales. Langendoen y Reijers presentan un estudio comparativo detallado de varios esquemas de localización en [16]. Hasta donde sabemos, Spotlight es el primer esquema de localización sin rango que funciona muy bien en un entorno al aire libre. Nuestro sistema requiere una línea de visión entre un solo dispositivo y los nodos del sensor, y el mapa del terreno donde se encuentra el campo del sensor. El sistema Spotlight tiene un rango largo efectivo (1000 metros) y no requiere ninguna infraestructura o hardware adicional para nodos de sensores. El sistema Spotlight combina las ventajas y no sufre las desventajas de las dos clases de localización.3. Diseño del sistema Spotlight La idea principal del sistema de localización de Spotlight es generar eventos controlados en el campo donde se implementaron los nodos del sensor. Un evento podría ser, por ejemplo, la presencia de luz en un área. Usando el momento en que un evento es percibido por un nodo del sensor y las propiedades espacio-temporales de los eventos generados, se pueden inferir información espacial (es decir, ubicación) con respecto al nodo del sensor. Figura 1. Localización de una red de sensores utilizando el sistema Spotlight que imaginamos y representa en la Figura 1, un escenario de implementación y localización de la red de sensores de la siguiente manera: los nodos de sensores inalámbricos se implementan aleatoriamente desde un vehículo aéreo no tripulado. Después de la implementación, los nodos del sensor se autoorganizan en una red y ejecutan un protocolo de sincronización de tiempo. Un vehículo aéreo (por ejemplo, helicóptero), equipado con un dispositivo, llamado Spotlight, vuela sobre la red y genera eventos de luz. Los nodos sensores detectan los eventos e informan al dispositivo de atención, a través de una estación base, las marcas de tiempo cuando se detectaron los eventos. El dispositivo Spotlight calcula la ubicación de los nodos del sensor. Durante el diseño de nuestro sistema de atención, hicimos los siguientes supuestos: - La red de sensores a localizar está conectada y está presente un middleware, capaz de reenviar datos de los nodos del sensor al dispositivo de atención.- El vehículo aéreo tiene un muy buen conocimiento sobre su posición y orientación (6 parámetros: 3 traducción y 3 rotación de cuerpo rígido) y posee el mapa del campo donde se desplegó la red.- Hay un poderoso dispositivo de focos disponible y puede generar 14 eventos espacialmente grandes que pueden detectar los nodos sensores, incluso en presencia de ruido de fondo (luz del día).- Existe una línea de visión entre el dispositivo Spotlight y los nodos del sensor. Nuestros supuestos simplifican suposiciones, destinadas a reducir la complejidad de la presentación, para mayor claridad. Proponemos soluciones que no confían en estos supuestos simplificadores, en la Sección 6. Para describir y generalizar formalmente el sistema de localización de Spotlight, presentamos las siguientes definiciones.3.1 Definiciones y formulación de problemas suponemos que el espacio a ⊂r3 contiene todos los nodos de sensores n, y que cada nodo Ni se coloca en Pi (x, y, z). Para obtener PI (X, Y, Z), un sistema de localización de foco necesita admitir tres funciones principales, a saber, una función de distribución de eventos (EDF) E (t), una función de detección de eventos D (E) y una función de localización L (Ti). Se definen formalmente de la siguiente manera: Definición 1: Un evento E (T, P) es un fenómeno detectable que ocurre en el tiempo T y en el punto P є A. Ejemplos de eventos son la luz, el calor, el humo, el sonido, etc. Sea ti = {ti1, ti2, ..., tin} un conjunto de n marcas de tiempo de tiempo detectadas por un nodo i. Sea t = {t1, t2, ..., tm} el conjunto de marcas de tiempo m de eventos generados en el campo del sensor. Definición 2: La función de detección de eventos D (e) define un algoritmo de detección binario. Para un evento dado E: ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = detectedNotiseVentFalse, DetectedEsEventTrue,) (E E ed (1) Definición 3: La función de distribución de eventos (edf) e (t) define la distribución puntual de los eventos dentro de un tiempo t:} {trueptedappte= ∧∈ =)), (((|) ((2) Definición 4: La función de localización L (Ti) define un algoritmo de localización con entrada Ti, una secuencia de marcas de tiempo de eventos detectados por el nodo I: i itt i tetl ∈=) () ((3) Figura 2. La arquitectura del sistema Spotlight, como se muestra en la Figura 2, la función de detección de eventos D (e) es compatible con los nodos del sensor. Se usa para determinar si ocurre un evento externo o no. Se puede implementar a través de un algoritmo de detección basado en umbral simple u otras técnicas avanzadas de procesamiento de señal digital. La distribución de eventos E (t) y las funciones de localización L (TI) son implementadas por un dispositivo de atención. La función de localización es un algoritmo de agregación que calcula la intersección de múltiples conjuntos de puntos. La función de distribución de eventos E (t) describe la distribución de eventos a lo largo del tiempo. Es el núcleo del sistema de atención y es mucho más sofisticado que las otras dos funciones. Debido al hecho de que E (T) es realizado por el dispositivo Spotlight, los requisitos de hardware para los nodos del sensor siguen siendo mínimos. Con el soporte de estas tres funciones, el proceso de localización es el siguiente: 1) Un dispositivo de atención distribuye eventos en el espacio durante un período de tiempo.2) Durante la distribución del evento, los nodos del sensor registran la secuencia de tiempo ti = {ti1, ti2, ..., tin} en la que detectan los eventos.3) Después de la distribución del evento, cada nodo del sensor envía la secuencia del tiempo de detección al dispositivo Spotlight.4) El dispositivo Spotlight estima la ubicación de un nodo del sensor I, utilizando la secuencia de tiempo Ti y la función E (t) conocida. La función de distribución de eventos E (t) es la técnica central utilizada en el sistema Spotlight y proponemos tres diseños para ella. Estos diseños tienen compensaciones diferentes y la comparación de costos se presenta en la Sección 3.5.3.2 Función de distribución de eventos de escaneo de puntos Para ilustrar la funcionalidad básica de un sistema de atención, comenzamos con un sistema de sensor simple donde se coloca un conjunto de nodos a lo largo de una línea recta (a = [0, l] r). El dispositivo Spotlight genera eventos puntuales (por ejemplo, puntos de luz) a lo largo de esta línea con velocidad constante s.El conjunto de marcas de tiempo de eventos detectados por un nodo I es ti = {ti1}. La función de distribución de eventos e (t) es: ⊂} {stpappte *) (= ∧∈ = (4) donde t ∈ [0, l/s]. La función de localización resultante es:} {sttetl iii ∗ == 11) () ((5) donde d (e (ti1, pi)) = true para el nodo I colocado en pi. La implementación de la función de distribución de eventos E (t) es sencilla. Como se muestra en la Figura 3 (a), cuando una fuente de luz emite un haz de luz con la velocidad angular dada por d s dt d s) (cos 2 αα α ==, se genera un evento de punto de luz con velocidad constante s a lo largo de la líneaSituado a la distancia d. Figura 3. La implementación del escaneo puntual de la EDF de escaneo de puntos se puede generalizar al caso donde los nodos se colocan en un plano bidimensional R2. En este caso, el sistema Spotlight escanea progresivamente el plano para activar los nodos del sensor. Este escenario se muestra en la Figura 3 (b).3.3 Función de distribución de eventos de escaneo de línea Algunos dispositivos, p.Los láseres de diodos, pueden generar una línea completa de eventos simultáneamente. Con estos dispositivos, podemos admitir la función distribuida de eventos de escaneo de línea fácilmente. Suponemos que los 15 nodos del sensor se colocan en un plano bidimensional (a = [l x l] ⊂r2) y que la velocidad de escaneo es s.El conjunto de marcas de tiempo de eventos detectados por un nodo I es ti = {ti1, ti2}. Figura 4. La implementación del escaneo de línea EDF El EDF de escaneo de línea se define de la siguiente manera: () {ks,*tpl] [0, kp (t) e kkx = ∧∈ =} para t ∈ [0, l/s] y:({ls*tk, pl] [0, kp (t) e kky - = ∧∈ =)} (6) para t ∈ [l/s, 2l/s]. U) () () (tetete yx = Podemos localizar un nodo calculando la intersección de las dos líneas de eventos, como se muestra en la Figura 4. Más formalmente: i) () () (21 iii tetetl = (7) donde d (e (ti1, pi)) = true, d (e (ti2, pi)) = verdadero para el nodo I colocado en pi. 3.4 áreaCubra la función de distribución de eventos Otros dispositivos, como los proyectores de luz, pueden generar eventos que cubren un área. Esto permite la implementación de la cubierta de área EDF. La idea de la cubierta de área EDF es dividir el espacio A en múltiples secciones y asignar un identificador binario único, llamado código, a cada sección. Supongamos que la localización se realiza dentro de un plano (un R2). Cada sección SK dentro de A tiene un código único k.La cubierta de área EDF se define de la siguiente manera: ⊂ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = 0iskOfBitjThiffalse, 1IskOfBitJTHIFTRUE,), (JKBIT (8)} {Truetkbitsppte k = ∧∈ =), () (y el algoritm de localización correspondiente es: {∧∈ = = =∧ ==)), (() (|) (iki ttiftruetkbitsCogpPtl (9)}) `), ((ittiffalSetkbit −∈ = donde cog (sk) denota el centro de gravedad de SK. Ilustramos la cubierta de área EDF con un ejemplo simple. Como se muestra en la Figura 5, el plano A se divide en 16 secciones. Cada sección SK tiene un código único k.El dispositivo Spotlight distribuye los eventos de acuerdo con estos códigos: en el momento J, una sección SK está cubierta por un evento (iluminado por la luz), si Jth Bit of K es 1. Un nodo que reside en cualquier parte de la sección SK se localiza en el centro de gravedad de esa sección. Por ejemplo, los nodos dentro de la sección 1010 detectan los eventos en el tiempo t = {1, 3}. En t = 4, la sección donde cada nodo reside puede determinarse que una localización más precisa requiere una partición más fina del plano, por lo tanto, el número de bits en el código aumentará. Teniendo en cuenta el ruido que está presente en un entorno real y al aire libre, es fácil observar que un error relativamente pequeño para detectar el patrón de bits correcto podría dar como resultado un gran error de localización. Volviendo al ejemplo que se muestra en la Figura 5, si un nodo del sensor se encuentra en la sección con el código 0000, y debido al ruido, en el tiempo t = 3, cree que detectó un evento, concluirá incorrectamente que su código es 1000, y se coloca dos cuadrados por debajo de su posición correcta. La precisión de localización puede deteriorarse aún más, si hay múltiples errores en la transmisión del código. Una solución natural a este problema es usar códigos de corrección de errores, que reducen en gran medida la probabilidad de un error, sin pagar el precio de una transmisión o alargando demasiado el tiempo de transmisión. Se han propuesto varios esquemas de corrección de errores en el pasado. Dos de los más notables son el código Hamming (7, 4) y el código Golay (23, 12). Ambos son códigos de corrección de errores lineales perfectos. El esquema de codificación de Hamming puede detectar errores de hasta 2 bits y corregir errores de 1 bits. En el esquema Hamming (7, 4), un mensaje que tiene 4 bits de datos (por ejemplo, DDDD, donde D es un bit de datos) se transmite como una palabra de 7 bits al agregar 3 bits de control de errores (por ejemplo, DDDPDPP, donde P es A A A A Abit de paridad). Figura 5. Los pasos del área cubren edf. Los eventos cubren las áreas sombreadas. Los pasos de la técnica de cubierta de área, cuando se usan el esquema Hamming (7, 4) se muestran en la Figura 6. Los códigos Golay pueden detectar errores de hasta 6 bits y corregir los errores de hasta 3 bits. Similar a Hamming (7, 4), Golay construye un código de código de 23 bits a partir de datos de 12 bits. Los códigos de Golay se han utilizado en la transmisión de datos satelitales y de naves espaciales y son más adecuados en los casos en que se desean longitudes cortas de codeword. Figura 6. Los pasos del área cubren EDF con Hamming (7, 4) ECC. Los eventos cubren las áreas sombreadas. Supongamos una probabilidad de error de 1 bits de 0.01 y un mensaje de 12 bits que debe transmitirse. La probabilidad de una transmisión fallida es, por lo tanto, 0.11, si no se usa la detección y corrección de errores;0.0061 para el esquema de hamming (es decir, más de 1 bits de error);y 0.000076 para el esquema Golay (es decir, más de 3 bits de errores). Golay es, por lo tanto, 80 veces más robusto que el esquema de Hamming, que es 20 veces más robusto que el esquema de corrección de no errores.16 Teniendo en cuenta que un número de correcciones limitado es posible por cualquier esquema de codificación, surge una pregunta natural: ¿podemos minimizar el error de localización cuando hay errores que no se pueden corregir? Esto se puede lograr mediante una colocación inteligente de códigos en la red. Como se muestra en la Figura 7, la colocación A, en presencia de un error de 1 bits, tiene un error de localización promedio menor en comparación con la colocación B. El objetivo de nuestra estrategia de colocación de código es reducir la distancia euclidiana total entre todos los pares de códigos con distancias de Hamming más pequeñas que K, el mayor número de errores esperados de 1 bits. Figura 7. Diferentes estrategias de colocación de código formalmente, una colocación está representada por una función p: [0, l] d → c, que asigna un código a cada coordenada en el cubo d-dimensional del tamaño L (por ejemplo, en el caso plano, colocamoscódigos en una cuadrícula 2dimensional). Denotamos por de (i, j) la distancia euclidiana y por dh (i, j) la distancia de hamming entre dos códigos i y j. En un entorno ruidoso, DH (I, J) determina la probabilidad de cruce entre los dos códigos. Para el caso de detecciones independientes, cuanto más alta sea DH (I, J), menor será la probabilidad de cruce. La función objetivo se define de la siguiente manera: D kjid e ljiwherejid h], 0 [,}), (min {), (∈estigdo (10) La ecuación 10 es un problema de programación no lineal y no convexo. En general, es analíticamente difícil obtener el mínimo global. Para superar esto, proponemos un método de colocación codicioso para obtener resultados subóptimos. En este método inicializamos la cuadrícula bidimensional con códigos. Luego intercambiamos los códigos dentro de la cuadrícula repetidamente, para minimizar la función objetivo. Para cada intercambio, elegimos con avidez un par de códigos, lo que puede reducir la función objetivo (ecuación 10) la mayoría. El método de colocación codiciosa propuesto termina cuando ningún intercambio de códigos puede minimizar aún más la función objetivo. Para la evaluación, comparamos el error de localización promedio en presencia de error de K-bit para dos estrategias: la colocación codiciosa propuesta y la colocación de mayor fila (coloca los códigos consecutivamente en la matriz, en el primer orden de fila).0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 Tamaño de la cuadrícula Localización Sorror [Gridunidad] Roda Major Colocación consecutiva Colocación codiciosa Figura 8. Error de localización con la colocación del código y no ECC Como muestra la Figura 8, si no hay capacidad de detección/corrección de errores y se producen errores de 1 bits, entonces nuestro método de colocación codiciosa puede reducir el error de localización en un 23%promedio, en comparación con la fila-Major Colocación. Si se utilizan esquemas de detección y corrección de errores (p. Hamming (12, 8) y si se producen errores de 3 bits (k = 3), entonces el método de colocación codiciosa reduce el error de localización en un 12%, en comparación con la colocación de la fila mayor, como se muestra en la Figura 9. Si K = 1, entonces no hay ningún beneficio en el uso del método de colocación codiciosa, ya que el esquema de Hamming puede corregir el error de 1 bits.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 Tamaño de la cuadrícula Localización Sorror [Gridunidad] ROWA Major Colocación consecutiva Colocación codiciosa Figura 9. Error de localización con el análisis de la función de distribución de eventos Hamming ECC 3.5 Aunque las tres técnicas mencionadas antes pueden localizar los nodos del sensor, difieren en el tiempo de localización, la gastos generales de comunicación y la energía consumida por la función de distribución de eventos (llamemos por gastos generales del evento). Supongamos que todos los nodos de sensores se encuentran en un cuadrado con tamaño de borde D, y que el dispositivo Spotlight puede generar n eventos (p. Ej. Punto, línea y eventos de cobertura de área) cada segundo y que el error de localización máximo tolerable es r.La Tabla 1 presenta la comparación de costos de ejecución de las tres técnicas diferentes de atención.

Sin embargo, el escaneo de puntos lleva mucho más tiempo que la técnica de cubierta de área, que termina en segundos de LOGRD. El método de escaneo de línea intercambia bien el evento de evento con el tiempo de localización. Al duplicar la sobrecarga del evento, el método de escaneo de línea solo toma el porcentaje de tiempo R/2D en completarse, en comparación con el método de escaneo de puntos. De la Tabla 1, se puede observar que los costos de ejecución no dependen del número de nodos de sensores a localizar. Es importante observar la sobrecarga del evento de relación por unidad de tiempo, lo que es indicativo del requisito de potencia para el dispositivo Spotlight. Esta relación es constante para la exploración puntual (R2 *N) mientras crece linealmente con área, para la cubierta de área (D2 *n/2). Si el área de implementación es muy grande, el uso de la cubierta de área EDF es prohibitivamente costoso, si no imposible. Para fines prácticos, la cubierta del área es una solución viable para redes pequeñas a medianas, mientras que el escaneo de línea funciona bien para redes grandes. Discutimos las implicaciones del requisito de potencia para el dispositivo Spotlight, y ofrecemos una solución híbrida en la Sección 6. 3.6 Análisis de errores de localización La precisión de la localización con la técnica de atención depende de muchos aspectos. Los principales factores que se consideraron durante la implementación del sistema se analizan a continuación: 17 tiempo de sincronización: el sistema de atención intercambia sellos de tiempo entre nodos de sensores y el dispositivo Spotlight. Es necesario que el sistema alcance el consenso sobre el tiempo global a través de la sincronización. Debido a la incertidumbre en el procesamiento de hardware y la comunicación inalámbrica, solo podemos limitar tales errores dentro de ciertos límites (por ejemplo, un Jiffy). Una entrada imprecisa a la función de localización L (t) conduce a un error en la localización de nodos.- Incertidumbre en la detección: la tasa de muestreo de los nodos del sensor es finita, en consecuencia, habrá un retraso impredecible entre el momento en que un evento está realmente presente y cuando el nodo del sensor lo detecta. Las tasas de muestreo más bajas generarán errores de localización más grandes.- Tamaño del evento: los eventos distribuidos por el dispositivo Spotlight no pueden ser infinitamente pequeños. Si un nodo detecta un evento, es difícil estimar la ubicación exacta de sí misma dentro del evento.- Realización de la función de distribución de eventos: EDF define ubicaciones de eventos en el tiempo t.Debido a la precisión limitada (por ejemplo, imprecisión mecánica), un dispositivo de atención podría generar eventos que se ubican de manera diferente de dónde se supone que deben estar estos eventos. Es importante observar que el error de localización es independiente del número de nodos sensores en la red. Esta independencia, así como la independencia mencionada del costo de ejecución, indican las muy buenas propiedades de escalabilidad (con el número de nodos de sensores, pero no con el área de implementación) que posee el sistema de atención.4. Implementación del sistema para nuestra evaluación de desempeño implementamos dos sistemas Spotlight. Usando estas dos implementaciones, pudimos investigar el espectro completo de las técnicas de distribución de eventos, propuestas en la Sección 3, a un costo único reducido (menos de $ 1,000). La primera implementación, llamada μSpotlight, tuvo un corto rango (10-20 metros), sin embargo, su capacidad de generar todo el espectro de EDF lo hizo muy útil. Utilizamos esta implementación principalmente para investigar las capacidades del sistema Spotlight y ajustar su rendimiento. No tenía la intención de representar la solución completa, sino solo una versión reducida del sistema. La segunda implementación, el sistema de atención, tuvo un rango mucho más largo (hasta 6500 m), pero estaba limitado en los tipos de EDF que puede generar. El objetivo de esta implementación era mostrar cómo funciona el sistema Spotlight en un entorno real y al aire libre, y mostrar correlaciones con los resultados experimentales obtenidos de la implementación del sistema μSpotlight. En la parte restante de esta sección, describimos cómo implementamos los tres componentes (distribución de eventos, detección de eventos y funciones de localización) de la arquitectura del centro de atención y el protocolo de sincronización de tiempo, un componente clave de nuestro sistema.4.1 µspotlight System El primer sistema que construimos, llamado μSpotlight, utilizado como dispositivo de atención, un proyector Infocus LD530 conectado a una computadora portátil IBM ThinkPad. El sistema se muestra en la Figura 10. La función de distribución de eventos se implementó como una GUI Java. Debido a los estrictos requisitos de tiempo y el retraso causado por el almacenamiento en búfer en el sistema de ventanas de una PC, utilizamos la API de modo exclusivo de pantalla completa proporcionada por Java2. Esto nos permitió evitar el sistema de ventanas y estimar con mayor precisión el momento en que el proyector muestra un evento, de ahí una mayor precisión de las marcas de tiempo de los eventos. Debido a la tasa de actualización de 50Hz de nuestro proyector, todavía había una incertidumbre en el estampado del tiempo de los eventos de 20 msec. Exploramos la posibilidad de usar y modificar el núcleo de Linux para exponer la interrupción de sincronización vertical (VSYNCH), generada por el dispositivo de visualización después de que cada pantalla se actualice, fuera del modo del núcleo. Los resultados de la evaluación del desempeño mostraron, sin embargo, que este nivel de precisión no era necesario. Los nodos sensores que utilizamos fueron Berkeley Mica2 Motes equipadas con tableros multisensor MTS310 de la ballesta. Este tablero de sensores contiene un sensor de fotos CDSE que puede detectar la luz del proyector. Figura 10. Implementación del sistema de μspotlight Con esta implementación del sistema Spotlight, pudimos generar eventos de escaneo de puntos, línea y área.4.2 SISTEMA DE SPARTLING El segundo sistema de foco de atención que construimos usó, como el dispositivo de foco de atención, los láseres de diodo, un montaje del telescopio computarizado (Celestron CG-5GT, que se muestra en la Figura 11) y una computadora portátil IBM ThinkPad. La computadora portátil estaba conectada, a través de interfaces RS232, al soporte del telescopio y a una mote XSM600CA [7], actuando como una estación base. Los láseres de diodo que utilizamos varían en potencia de 7MW a 35MW. Emitieron a 650 nm, cerca del punto de mayor sensibilidad para CDSE Photosensor. Los láseres de diodo estaban equipados con lentes que nos permitieron controlar la divergencia del haz. Figura 11. Implementación del sistema de atención El soporte del telescopio tiene engranajes de gusano para un movimiento suave y mediciones angulares de alta precisión. Las dos medidas angulares que utilizamos fueron las llamadas alt (de altitud) y AZ (de azimut). En astronomía, la altitud de un objeto celestial es su distancia angular por encima o por debajo del horizonte celestial, y el acimut es la distancia angular de un objeto hacia el este del meridiano, a lo largo del horizonte.18 La computadora portátil, a través de una GUI Java, controla el movimiento del soporte del telescopio, orientándola de tal manera que se realice un escaneo completo de un área, similar al descrito en la Figura 3 (b). Para cada punto de inflexión I, se registra el 3-tupla (ángulos Alti y Azi y la marca de tiempo TI). El sistema Spotlight utiliza la marca de tiempo recibida de un nodo del sensor J, para obtener las medidas angulares ALTJ y AZJ para su ubicación. Para los nodos sensores, utilizamos motas XSM, principalmente debido a su rango de comunicación más largo. El XSM Mote tiene el sensor de fotos incrustado en su tablero principal. Tuvimos que hacer ajustes menores a la carcasa de plástico para exponer el sensor de fotos al exterior. El mismo código MOTE, escrito en NESC, para Tinyos, se utilizó para las implementaciones del sistema µspotlight y de atención.4.3 Función de detección de eventos D (t) La función de detección de eventos tiene como objetivo detectar el comienzo de un evento y registrar el tiempo en que se observó el evento. Implementamos una función de detección muy simple basada en el valor máximo observado. Un evento que estaré estampado con tiempo TI, si la lectura del sensor de fotos DTI cumple la condición: itdd <Δ+max donde dmax es el valor máximo reportado por el sensor de fotos antes de ti y δ es una constante que garantiza queLa primera detección grande proporciona la marca de tiempo del evento (es decir, no se consideran pequeñas variaciones alrededor de la primera señal grande). Por lo tanto, δ garantiza que solo los cambios agudos en el valor detectado generan un evento observado.4.4 Función de localización L (t) La función de localización se implementa en la GUI Java. Coincide con las marcas de tiempo creadas por la función de distribución de eventos con las reportadas por los nodos del sensor. La función de localización para el punto de escaneo de puntos tiene como entrada una secuencia de tiempo ti = {t1}, según lo informado por el nodo i. La función realiza una búsqueda simple del evento con una marca de tiempo más cercana a T1. Si T1 está limitado por: 11 + << nn ee ttt donde en y en + 1 son dos eventos consecutivos, entonces la ubicación obtenida para el nodo I es: 11, ++ == nn ee yyxx El caso para el escaneo de línea se tratasimilarmente. La entrada a la función de localización es la secuencia de tiempo ti = {t1, t2} según lo informado por el nodo i. Si las marcas de tiempo informadas están limitadas por: 11 + << nn ee ttt, y 12 + << mm ee ttt donde en y en + 1 son dos eventos consecutivos en el escaneo horizontal y EM y EM + 1 son dos eventos consecutivos en verticales verticalesescanear, luego la ubicación inferida para el nodo I es: 11, ++ == mn ee yyxx La función de localización para la cubierta de área EDF tiene como entrada una marca de tiempo establecida ti = {ti1, ti2, ..., estaño} de los eventos n,detectado por nodo i. Recordamos la notación para el conjunto de marcas de tiempo M de eventos generados por el dispositivo Spotlight, t = {t1, t2, ..., tm}. Un código di = di1di2 ... dim se construye para cada nodo I, de modo que dij = 1 si tj ∈Ti y dij = 0 si tj ∉ ti. La función realiza una búsqueda de un evento con un código idéntico. Si la siguiente condición es verdadera: nei dd = donde en es un evento con código de código, entonces la ubicación inferida para el nodo I es: nn ee yyxx ==, 4.5 sincronización de tiempo La sincronización de tiempo en el sistema de atención consta de dos partes: - - - - -Sincronización entre nodos sensores: esto se logra a través del protocolo de sincronización del tiempo de inundación [18]. En este protocolo, los nodos sincronizados (el nodo raíz es el único nodo sincronizado al principio) envíe un mensaje de sincronización de tiempo a nodos no sincronizados. El remitente coloca la marca de tiempo en el mensaje de sincronización justo antes de que se transmitan los bytes que contienen la marca de tiempo. Una vez que un receptor recibe el mensaje, sigue el tiempo de los remitentes y realiza los cálculos necesarios para compensar la deriva del reloj.- Sincronización entre los nodos del sensor y el dispositivo Spotlight: implementamos esta parte a través de un apretón de manos de dos vías entre el dispositivo de atención y un nodo, utilizado como la estación base. El nodo del sensor está conectado al dispositivo Spotlight a través de una interfaz serie. Figura 12. Sincronización de dos vías Como se muestra en la Figura 12, supongamos que el dispositivo Spotlight envía un mensaje de sincronización (sincronización) en la hora local T1, el nodo del sensor lo recibe a su hora local T2 y lo reconoce a tiempo local T3 (tanto T2 como T3se envían de regreso a través de ACK). Después de que el dispositivo Spotlight recibe el ACK, a su hora local T4, la sincronización del tiempo se puede lograr de la siguiente manera: 2) () (4312 TTTT Offset - + - = (11) Offsetttt SpotlightNodeGlobal +== Notamos que la ecuación 11 supone que esoLos retrasos de un viaje son los mismos en ambas direcciones. En la práctica, esto no se mantiene lo suficientemente bien. Para mejorar el rendimiento, separamos el proceso de apretón de manos de los intercambios de marca de tiempo. El apretón de manos se realiza rápidamente, a través de un intercambio de 2 bytes entre el dispositivo Spotlight y el nodo del sensor (las marcas de tiempo aún se registran, pero no se envían). Después de este avance rápido, se intercambian las estampillas de tiempo grabadas. El resultado indica que este enfoque puede mejorar significativamente la precisión de la sincronización del tiempo.5. Evaluación del desempeño En esta sección presentamos la evaluación del rendimiento de los sistemas de atención cuando utilizan las tres funciones de distribución de eventos, es decir. Escaneo de puntos, escaneo de línea y cubierta de área, descrita en la Sección 3. 19 Para el sistema µspotlight, utilizamos 10 motas de mica2. Los nodos del sensor se unieron a una placa Veltex posicionada verticalmente. Al proyectar la luz a los nodos del sensor, podemos generar eventos de punto, línea y área bien controlados. El dispositivo Spotlight pudo generar eventos, es decir, patrones de luz del proyecto, que cubre un área de tamaño aproximado 180x140cm2. La resolución de pantalla para el proyector fue de 1024x768, y el movimiento de las técnicas de exploración de puntos y escaneo de línea se realizó a través de incrementos (en la dirección apropiada) de 10 píxeles entre eventos. Cada punto experimental se obtuvo de 10 ejecuciones sucesivas del procedimiento de localización. Cada conjunto de 10 ejecuciones fue precedido por una fase de calibración, destinada a estimar los retrasos totales (entre el dispositivo de foco y cada nodo del sensor) para detectar un evento. Durante la calibración, creamos un evento que cubre todo el campo del sensor (iluminó toda el área). La marca de tiempo informada por cada nodo del sensor, junto con la marca de tiempo creada por el dispositivo de foco se usó para obtener el desplazamiento de tiempo, para cada nodo del sensor. Procedimientos de calibración más sofisticados se han informado previamente [35]. Además del desplazamiento del tiempo, agregamos un parámetro configurable manualmente, llamado sesgo. Se utilizó para estimar mejor el centro de un evento. Figura 13. Sitio de implementación para el sistema de atención para la evaluación del sistema Spotlight, implementamos 10 motas XSM en un campo de fútbol. El sitio se muestra en la Figura 13 (los haces láser se representan con flechas rojas y nodos de sensor con puntos blancos). Se ejecutaron dos conjuntos de experimentos, con el dispositivo de foco colocado a 46 my a 170 m del campo del sensor. Los nodos del sensor se alinearon y el dispositivo Spotlight ejecutó un escaneo de puntos. El sistema de localización calculó las coordenadas de los nodos del sensor, y el dispositivo Spotlight estaba orientado, a través de un comando GOTO enviado al soporte del telescopio, hacia la ubicación calculada. En las etapas iniciales de los experimentos, medimos manualmente el error de localización. Para nuestra evaluación experimental, las métricas de interés fueron las siguientes: - Error de localización, definido como la distancia, entre la ubicación real y la obtenida del sistema de atención.- Duración de localización, definida como el lapso de tiempo entre el primer y último evento.- El rango de localización, definido como la distancia máxima entre el dispositivo de atención y los nodos del sensor.- Un costo de la función de costo de localización: {{precisión de localización}, {duración de localización}} → [0,1] cuantifica la compensación entre la precisión en la localización y la duración de la localización. El objetivo es minimizar la función de costo de localización. Al denotar con EI el error de localización para el escenario ésimo, con DI la duración de la localización para el escenario ésano, con max (e) el error máximo de localización, con max (d) la duración máxima de localización, y con el factor de importancia, el factor de importancia, el factor de importancia, el factor de importancia, el factor de importancia, el factor de importancia, el factor de importanciaLa función de costo de localización se define formalmente como :) max () 1 () max (), (d d e e decost II II ∗ -+∗ = αα - sesgo de localización. Esta métrica se utiliza para investigar la efectividad del procedimiento de calibración. Si, por ejemplo, todas las ubicaciones calculadas tienen un sesgo en la dirección oeste, se puede usar un factor de calibración para compensar la diferencia. Los parámetros que variamos durante la evaluación del rendimiento de nuestro sistema fueron: el tipo de escaneo (punto, línea y área), el tamaño del evento, la duración del evento (para la cubierta del área), la velocidad de escaneo, la potencia deel láser y la distancia entre el dispositivo de atención y el campo del sensor, para estimar el rango del sistema.5.1 Puntos Scan - μSpotlight System En este experimento, investigamos cómo el tamaño del evento y la velocidad de escaneo afectan el error de localización. La Figura 14 muestra los errores medios de localización con sus desviaciones estándar. Se puede observar que, si bien la velocidad de escaneo, que varía entre 35 cm/seg y 87 cm/seg, tiene una influencia menor en la precisión de localización, el tamaño del evento tiene un efecto dramático.0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 21.0 24.5 Tamaño del evento [CM] UbicaciónError [CM] 87cm/seg 58cm/seg 43cm/seg 35cm/seg Figura 14. Error de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el punto de escaneo EDF El error de localización obtenido varió de tan solo 2 cm a más de 11 cm para el evento más grande. Esta dependencia puede explicarse por nuestro algoritmo de detección de eventos: la primera detección por encima de un umbral dio la marca de tiempo para el evento. La duración del esquema de localización se muestra en la Figura 15. La dependencia de la duración de la localización del tamaño del evento y la velocidad de escaneo es natural. Un evento más grande permite una reducción en la duración total de hasta el 70%. La duración de la localización es directamente proporcional a la velocidad de escaneo, como se esperaba, y se representa en la Figura 15. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 21.0 24.5 Tamaño del evento [CM] Duración de localización [Sec] 87cm/sec 58cm/sec 43cm/Sec 35 cm/seg Figura 15. Duración de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el escaneo de puntos 20 Una compensación interesante es entre la precisión de localización (generalmente el factor más importante) y el tiempo de localización (importante en los entornos donde la sigilo es primordial). La Figura 16 muestra la función de costo de localización, para α = 0.5 (la precisión y la duración son igualmente importantes). Como se muestra en la Figura 16, se puede observar que un tamaño de evento de aproximadamente 10-15 cm (dependiendo de la velocidad de escaneo) minimiza nuestra función de costo. Para α = 1, el mismo gráfico sería una función monotónicamente que aumenta, mientras que para α = 0, sería una función disminución monotónica.0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 Tamaño del evento [CM] Localización [%] 87cm/seg 58cm/seg 43cm/seg 35cm/seg Figura 16. Costo de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el escaneo Point EDF 5.2 Línea Escaneo: μSpotlight System de manera similar al EDF de escaneo de puntos, para el escaneo de línea EDF estábamos interesados en la dependencia del error de localización y la duración del tamaño del evento y la velocidad de escaneo. Representamos en la Figura 17 el error de localización para diferentes tamaños de eventos. Es interesante observar la dependencia (forma cóncava) del error de localización frente al tamaño del evento. Además, una pregunta que debería surgir es la razón por la cual no se observó la misma dependencia en el caso del escaneo de puntos EDF.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Tamaño del evento [CM] UbicaciónError [CM] 87cm/seg 58cm/seg 43cm/seg 35cm/seg Figura 17. Error de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el escaneo de línea La explicación de esta dependencia cóncava es la existencia de un sesgo en la estimación de la ubicación. Como recordatorio, se introdujo un factor de sesgo para estimar mejor el punto central de los eventos que tienen un gran tamaño. Lo que muestra la Figura 17 es el hecho de que el factor de sesgo fue óptimo para un tamaño de evento de aproximadamente 7 cm. Para los eventos más pequeños y más grandes que esto, el factor de sesgo era demasiado grande y demasiado pequeño, respectivamente. Por lo tanto, introdujo errores sesgados en la estimación de posición. La razón por la que no observamos la misma dependencia en el caso del punto de escaneo de puntos era que no experimentamos con tamaños de eventos por debajo de 7 cm, debido a la mucho tiempo que habría tomado escanear todo el campo con eventos tan pequeños como 1.7cm. Los resultados para la duración de la localización en función del tamaño del evento se muestran en la Figura 18. Como se muestra, la duración de la localización es directamente proporcional a la velocidad de escaneo. El tamaño del evento tiene una influencia menor en la duración de la localización. Uno puede observar la duración promedio de localización de aproximadamente 10 segundos, mucho más corta que la duración obtenida en el experimento de escaneo de puntos. La dependencia de la función de costo de localización del tamaño del evento y la velocidad de escaneo, para α = 0.5, se muestra en la Figura 19. La dependencia de la velocidad de escaneo es muy pequeña (la función de costo logra un mínimo en el mismo rango de 4-6 cm). Es interesante observar que este tamaño de evento óptimo de 4-6 cm es más pequeño que el observado en el caso de Point Scan EDF. La explicación de esto es que la menor duración de localización observada en la línea de escaneo EDF, permitió un cambio (hacia tamaños de eventos más pequeños) en la función de costo de localización total.0 5 10 15 20 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Tamaño del evento [CM] Duración de localización [Sec] 87cm/seg 58 cm/seg 43cm/seg 35cm/seg Figura 18.

Función de costos vs. Tamaño del evento Para la línea de escaneo EDF durante nuestros experimentos con la línea de escaneo EDF, observamos evidencia de un sesgo en la estimación de ubicación. Las ubicaciones estimadas para todos los nodos sensores exhibieron diferentes sesgos, para diferentes tamaños de eventos. Por ejemplo, para un tamaño de evento de 17.5 cm, la ubicación estimada para los nodos del sensor fue al tamaño de la parte superior izquierda de la ubicación real. Esto fue equivalente a una detección temprana, ya que nuestro escaneo se realizó de izquierda a derecha y de arriba a abajo. La velocidad de escaneo no influyó en el sesgo. Para comprender mejor los fenómenos observados, analizamos nuestros datos. La Figura 20 muestra el sesgo en la dirección horizontal, para diferentes tamaños de eventos (el sesgo vertical fue casi idéntico, y lo omitimos, debido a limitaciones de espacio). De la Figura 20, se puede observar que el sesgo observado más pequeño y, por lo tanto, el posicionamiento más preciso, fue para un evento de tamaño 7cm. Estos resultados son consistentes con el error de localización observado, que se muestra en la Figura 17. También ajustamos el error de localización medido (que se muestra en la Figura 17) para el sesgo observado (que se muestra en la Figura 20). Los resultados de un caso ideal de sistema de localización de atención con EDF de escaneo de línea se muestran en la Figura 21. Los errores son notablemente pequeños, variando entre 0.1 cm y 0.8 cm, con una tendencia general de errores de localización más altos para tamaños de eventos más grandes.21-6 -5 -4 -3 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 1.7 3.5 7.0 10.5 14.0 17.5 Tamaño del evento [CM] Horizontalbias [CM] 87cm/seg 58cm/seg 43cm/seg 35cm/seg Figura 20.

Estimación de posición sin sesgo (ideal), para la línea de escaneo de línea EDF 5.3 Cubierta de área: μspotlight System En este experimento, investigamos cómo el número de bits utilizados para cuantificar todo el campo del sensor, afectó la precisión de localización. En nuestro primer experimento no usamos códigos de corrección de errores. Los resultados se muestran en la Figura 22. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 6 8 10 12 Número de bits UbicationError [CM] 20ms/Event 40ms/Event 60ms/Event 80ms/Event 100ms/Event Figura 22. Error de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para la cubierta de área EDF Se puede observar una precisión notable, con un error de localización en el orden de 0.3-0.6 cm. Lo que es importante observar es la varianza en el error de localización. En el escenario donde se usaron 12 bits, mientras que el error promedio fue muy pequeño, hubo un par de casos, donde una detección de eventos incorrecta generó un error más grande de lo esperado. Un ejemplo de cómo puede ocurrir este error se describió en la Sección 3.4. Los resultados experimentales, presentados en la Figura 22, enfatizan la necesidad de corrección de errores de los patrones de bits observados e informados por los nodos sensores. Los resultados de la duración de la localización se muestran en la Figura 23. Se puede observar que la duración es directamente proporcional con el número de bits utilizados, con duraciones totales que van desde 3 segundos, para el método menos preciso, a 6-7 segundos para el más preciso. La duración de un evento tuvo una pequeña influencia en el tiempo total de localización, al considerar el mismo escenario (el mismo número de bits para el código). La dependencia de la función de costo del número de bits en el código, para α = 0.5, se muestra en la Figura 24. En general, dado que la duración de la localización para el escaneo de área puede ser extremadamente pequeña, se desea una mayor precisión en la localización. Si bien la función de costo logra un mínimo cuando se usan 10 bits, atribuimos el ligero aumento observado cuando se usaron 12 bits para los dos escenarios de 12 bits donde se observaron los errores esperados, a saber, 6-7 mm (como se muestra en la Figura 22).0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6 8 10 12 Número de BITS Duración de localización [Sec] 20ms/Evento 40ms/Evento 60ms/Event 80ms/Event 100ms/Event Figura 23.

Error de localización sin corrección de errores de localización Los dos escenarios problemáticos (que se muestran en la Figura 22, donde para los códigos de 12 bits observamos errores mayores que el tamaño del evento, debido a errores en la detección) se exploraron más a fondo mediante el uso de códigos de corrección de errores. Como se describe en la Sección 3.3, implementamos un mecanismo de corrección de errores Golay (24, 12) extendido en nuestro algoritmo de estimación de ubicación. Los resultados experimentales se representan en la Figura 25 y muestran una precisión consistente. El escenario sin códigos de corrección de errores es simplemente el mismo escenario de código de 12 bits, que se muestra en la Figura 22. Solo investigamos el escenario de 12 bits, debido a su coincidencia con los datos de 12 bits requeridos por el esquema de codificación Golay (Golay extendido que produce codewords de 24 bits).22 5.4 Puntos Scan - Sistema de atención En esta sección describimos los experimentos realizados en un estadio de fútbol, utilizando nuestro sistema de atención. El hardware que teníamos disponible nos permitió evaluar la técnica de escaneo de puntos del sistema Spotlight. En nuestra evaluación, estábamos interesados en ver el rendimiento del sistema en diferentes rangos. Las Figuras 26 y 27 muestran el error de localización versus el tamaño del evento en dos rangos diferentes: 46m y 170m. La Figura 26 muestra una notable precisión en la localización. Los errores están en el rango de centímetro. Nuestras mediciones manuales iniciales del error de localización fueron la mayoría de las veces difíciles de hacer, ya que el lugar del láser cubría casi perfectamente la mote XSM. Podemos lograr errores de localización de unos pocos centímetros, que solo los esquemas de localización basados en el rango pueden lograr [25]. La dependencia observada del tamaño del evento es similar a la observada en la evaluación del sistema μspotlight, y se muestra en la Figura 14. Esto demostró que el sistema μSpotlight es una alternativa viable para investigar EDF complejos, sin incurrir en los costos del hardware necesario.0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Tamaño del evento [CM] Localización de localización [CM] 0.41m/seg 0.81m/seg 1.7m/seg Figura 26. Error de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el sistema de atención a 46 m en los experimentos realizados en una distancia mucho más larga entre el dispositivo de atención y la red de sensores, el error de localización promedio sigue siendo muy pequeño. Se midieron errores de localización de 510 cm, como muestra la Figura 27. Simplemente nos sorprendió la precisión de la que el sistema es capaz, al considerar que el sistema de foco funcionaba a lo largo de un estadio de fútbol. A lo largo de nuestra experimentación con el sistema de atención, hemos observado errores de localización que eran simplemente compensaciones de ubicaciones reales. Dado que se observó el mismo fenómeno al experimentar con el sistema μspotlight, creemos que con la auto calibración, el error de localización puede reducirse aún más.0 5 10 15 20 25 25 6 12 18 Tamaño del evento [CM] Localización de localización [CM] 0.7m/seg 1.4m/seg 3m/seg Figura 27. Error de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el sistema de atención a los 170 m El tiempo requerido para la localización utilizando el sistema de atención con un escaneo de puntos EDF, viene dado por: t = (l*l)/(s*es), donde l y l son las dimensiones del sensorCampo de red, S es la velocidad de escaneo y ES es el tamaño del evento. La Figura 28 muestra el tiempo para localizar una red de sensores desplegada en un área de tamaño de un campo de fútbol utilizando el sistema de atención. Aquí ignoramos el tiempo de propagación de mensajes, desde los nodos del sensor hasta el dispositivo Spotlight. De la Figura 28 se puede observar que los errores de localización muy pequeños son prohibitivamente caros en el caso del escaneo de puntos. Cuando los errores de localización de hasta 1 m son tolerables, la duración de la localización puede ser tan baja como 4 minutos. Duraciones de localización de 5-10 minutos, y los errores de localización de 1M son actualmente el estado de arte en el ámbito de los esquemas de localización sin rango. Y estos resultados se logran utilizando el esquema de escaneo de puntos, que requirió el tiempo de localización más alto, como se muestra en la Tabla 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Tamaño del evento [CM] Tiempo de localización [min] 3m/seg 6m/seg 9m/seg Figura 28. Tiempo de localización vs. Tamaño del evento para el sistema Spotlight Una característica importante del sistema Spotlight es su rango. Los dos factores más importantes son la sensibilidad del fotosensor y el poder de la fuente de atención. Estábamos interesados en medir el rango de nuestro sistema de atención, considerando nuestras capacidades (tablero de sensores MTS310 y de bajo costo, $ 12- $ 85, láser de diodo). Como resultado, medimos la intensidad del haz láser, con el mismo enfoque, a diferentes distancias. Los resultados se muestran en la Figura 29. 950 1000 1050 1100 0 50 100 150 200 Distancia [m] Intensidad [ADCCount] 35MW 7MW Figura 29. Rango de localización Para el sistema de atención de la Figura 29, se puede observar que solo se produce una disminución menor en la intensidad, debido a la absorción y posiblemente a nuestro enfoque imperfecto del haz láser. Un ajuste lineal de los datos experimentales muestra que se pueden lograr distancias de hasta 6500m. Si bien no esperamos que las condiciones atmosféricas, a grandes distancias, sean similares a nuestra evaluación de 200 m, existe una fuerte evidencia de que las distancias (es decir, la altitud) de 1000-2000m se pueden lograr fácilmente. El ángulo entre el haz láser y la vertical debe minimizarse (menos de 45 °), ya que reduce la diferencia entre la sección transversal del haz (tamaño del evento) y la proyección real del haz en el suelo. De manera similar, estábamos interesados en descubrir el tamaño máximo de un evento, que puede ser generado por un láser COTS y que es detectable por el fotosensor existente. Para esto, 23 variamos la divergencia del haz láser y medimos la intensidad de la luz, como lo dio el recuento de ADC. Los resultados se muestran en la Figura 30. Se puede observar que para el láser menos potente, un tamaño de evento de 1,5 m es el límite. Para el láser más poderoso, el tamaño del evento puede ser tan alto como 4M. A través de nuestros extensos resultados de evaluación del rendimiento, hemos demostrado que el sistema de atención es una solución factible, altamente precisa y de bajo costo para la localización de redes de sensores inalámbricos. Desde nuestra experiencia con fuentes de radiación láser, creemos que para las implementaciones de red de sensores pequeños y medianos, en áreas de menos de 20,000m2, el esquema de cobertura de área es una solución viable. Para las implementaciones de red de sensores de gran tamaño, el escaneo de línea o un uso incremental de la cubierta de área son muy buenas opciones.0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 Tamaño del evento [CM] Intensidad [ADCCount] 35MW 7MW Figura 30. Tamaños de eventos detectables que pueden generar los láseres de COTS 6. Optimizaciones/lecciones aprendidas 6.1 Sistema de atención distribuida El diseño propuesto y la implementación del sistema de foco pueden considerarse centralizados, debido a la recopilación de los datos del sensor y la ejecución de la función de localización L (t) por el dispositivo Spotlight. Mostramos que este diseño se puede transformar fácilmente en uno distribuido, ofreciendo dos soluciones. Una idea es difundir en la red, la información sobre la ruta de los eventos, generado por el EDF (similar a una ecuación, describiendo una ruta) y dejar que los nodos del sensor ejecuten la función de localización. Por ejemplo, en el escenario de escaneo de línea, si los puntos de inicio y finalización para los escaneos horizontales y verticales, y los tiempos a los que se alcanzaron, se propagan en la red, entonces cualquier sensor en la red puede obtener su ubicación (suponiendo un escaneo constantevelocidad). Una segunda solución es usar nodos de anclaje que conozcan sus posiciones. En el caso del escaneo de línea, si hay tres anclajes, después de detectar la presencia de los dos eventos, los anclajes inundan la red con sus ubicaciones y tiempos de detección. Usando las mismas fórmulas simples que en el esquema anterior, todos los nodos sensores pueden inferir sus posiciones.6.2 Reducción de gastos generales de localización Otro requisito impuesto por el diseño del sistema Spotlight, es el uso de un protocolo de sincronización de tiempo entre el dispositivo Spotlight y la red de sensores. Relajarse este requisito e imponer un protocolo de sincronización de tiempo entre los nodos sensores es un objetivo muy deseable. La idea es utilizar el conocimiento que el dispositivo Spotlight tiene sobre la velocidad con la que tiene lugar el escaneo del campo del sensor. Si la velocidad de escaneo es constante (llamemos la S), entonces la diferencia de tiempo (llamándola ΔT) entre las detecciones de eventos de dos nodos sensores es, de hecho, una medida precisa del rango entre ellos: D = S*ΔT. Por lo tanto, el sistema de atención se puede usar para un rango preciso de la distancia entre cualquier par de nodos de sensor. Una observación importante es que esta técnica de rango no sufre de limitaciones de los demás: rango pequeño y direccionalidad para la ecografía, o irregularidad, desvanecimiento y múltiples trayectoria para el indicador de resistencia a la señal recibida (RSSI). Después de que los rangos entre nodos se hayan determinado (ya sea de manera centralizada o distribuida), se pueden utilizar algoritmos de incrustación de gráficos para la realización de un gráfico rígido, que describe la topología de la red de sensores.6.3 Función de distribución de eventos dinámicos E (t) Otra optimización del sistema es para entornos donde la densidad del nodo del sensor no es uniforme. Una desventaja de la técnica de escaneo de línea, en comparación con la cubierta del área, es el tiempo de localización. Una idea es usar dos escaneos: uno que utiliza un tamaño de evento grande (por lo tanto, errores de localización más grandes), seguido de un segundo escaneo en el que el tamaño del evento cambia dinámicamente. El primer escaneo se utiliza para identificar las áreas con una mayor densidad de nodos sensores. El segundo escaneo utiliza un evento más grande en áreas donde la densidad del nodo del sensor es baja y un evento más pequeño en áreas con una mayor densidad de nodo del sensor. También se puede usar un EDF dinámico cuando es muy difícil cumplir con los requisitos de potencia para el dispositivo de atención (impuesto por el uso del esquema de cobertura del área en un área muy grande). En este escenario, se puede usar un esquema híbrido: el primer escaneo (escaneo de puntos) se realiza rápidamente, con un tamaño de evento muy grande, y está destinado a identificar, aproximadamente, la ubicación de la red de sensores. Los escaneos de cobertura de área posteriores se ejecutarán en partes más pequeñas de la red, hasta que se localice todo el área de implementación.6.4 Seed Sigital Nuestra implementación del sistema Spotlight utilizó luz visible para crear eventos. Usando el sistema durante la luz del día o en una habitación bien iluminada, plantea desafíos debido a la radiación de la lámpara solar o fluorescente, que genera un fuerte ruido de fondo. La alternativa, que utilizamos en nuestras evaluaciones de rendimiento, fue usar el sistema en una habitación oscura (sistema μspotlight) o durante la noche (sistema de atención). Si bien el uso del sistema de atención durante la noche es una buena solución para entornos donde la sigilo no es importante (por ejemplo, ciencias ambientales) para otros (por ejemplo, aplicaciones militares), divulgando la presencia y la ubicación de un campo de sensores, podría comprometer seriamente la eficacia del sistema. Figura 31. Los espectros de luz fluorescente (TOP), respuesta espectral para las células CDSE (abajo) Una solución a este problema, que experimentamos en el sistema µspotlight, fue usar un filtro óptico en la parte superior del sensor de luz 24. La respuesta espectral de un sensor de fotos CDSE abarca casi todo el dominio visible [37], con un pico de aproximadamente 700 nm (figura 31-fondo). Como se muestra en la Figura 31, la luz fluorescente no tiene componentes significativos superiores a 700 nm. Por lo tanto, un filtro rojo simple (Schott RG-630), que transmite toda la luz con una longitud de onda aproximadamente por encima de 630 nm, junto con una función de distribución de eventos que genera eventos con longitudes de onda por encima del mismo umbral, permitiría el uso del sistema cuando una luz fluorescenteestá presente. Una solución para que el sistema de atención sea sigiloso por la noche es usar una fuente de radiación infrarroja (es decir, láser) que emite en el rango [750, 1000] nm. Para un uso de la luz del día del sistema de atención, el desafío es superar el fuerte fondo de la luz natural. Una solución que estamos considerando es el uso de un filtro óptico de banda estrecha, centrada en la longitud de onda de la radiación láser. La viabilidad y la rentabilidad de esta solución aún no se han demostrado.6.5 Red desplegada en terreno desconocido Una generalización adicional es cuando se desconoce el mapa del terreno donde se implementa la red de sensores. Si bien esto es muy poco probable para muchas aplicaciones civiles de tecnologías de redes de sensores inalámbricos, no es difícil imaginar aplicaciones militares donde la red de sensores se despliegue en un terreno hostil y desconocido. Una solución a este problema es un sistema que utiliza dos dispositivos de atención, o de manera equivalente, el uso del mismo dispositivo de dos posiciones distintas, ejecutando, de cada uno de ellos, un procedimiento de localización completo. En este esquema, la posición del nodo del sensor está determinada de manera única por la intersección de las dos instrucciones de ubicación obtenidas por el sistema. La localización relativa (para cada par de dispositivos de atención) requerirá un conocimiento preciso de la traducción 3 y 3 parámetros de rotación de cuerpo rígido para la posición y orientación de los focos (como se menciona en la Sección 3). Esta generalización también es aplicable a escenarios en los que, debido a las variaciones del terreno, no hay un solo punto aéreo con una línea de visión directa para todos los nodos sensores, p.terreno montañoso. Al ejecutar el procedimiento de localización desde diferentes puntos aéreos, aumenta la probabilidad de establecer una línea de visión con todos los nodos. Para algunos escenarios militares [1] [12], donde prevalece el terreno abierto, la existencia de una línea de visión no es un factor limitante. A la luz de esto, el sistema de atención no se puede usar en bosques o ambientes interiores.7. Conclusiones y trabajo futuro En este documento presentamos el diseño, implementación y evaluación de un sistema de localización para redes de sensores inalámbricos, llamado Spotlight. Nuestra solución de localización no requiere ningún hardware adicional para los nodos sensores, aparte de lo que ya existe. Toda la complejidad del sistema está encapsulada en un solo dispositivo de atención. Nuestro sistema de localización es reutilizable, es decir, los costos pueden amortizarse a través de varias implementaciones, y su rendimiento no se ve afectado por la cantidad de nodos de sensores en la red. Nuestros resultados experimentales, obtenidos de un sistema real implementado al aire libre, muestran que el error de localización es inferior a 20 cm. Este error es actualmente el estado de arte, incluso para los sistemas de localización basados en el rango y es un 75% más pequeño que el error obtenido cuando se usa dispositivos GPS o cuando la implementación manual de nodos sensores es una opción factible [31]. Como trabajo futuro, nos gustaría explorar la autocalibración y el auto-ajuste del sistema de atención. La precisión del sistema puede mejorarse aún más si se informa la distribución del evento, en lugar de una sola marca de tiempo. Se podría obtener una generalización reformulando el problema como un problema de estimación angular que proporciona los bloques de construcción para técnicas de localización más generales.8.

        "The Spotlight device computes the location of the sensor nodes.",
        "During the design of our Spotlight system, we made the following assumptions: - the sensor network to be localized is connected and a middleware, able to forward data from the sensor nodes to the Spotlight device, is present. - the aerial vehicle has a very good knowledge about its position and orientation (6 parameters: 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation) and it possesses the map of the field where the network was deployed. - a powerful Spotlight device is available and it is able to generate 14 spatially large events that can be detected by the sensor nodes, even in the presence of background noise (daylight). - a line of sight between the Spotlight device and sensor nodes exists.",
        "Our assumptions are simplifying assumptions, meant to reduce the complexity of the presentation, for clarity.",
        "We propose solutions that do not rely on these simplifying assumptions, in Section 6.",
        "In order to formally describe and generalize the Spotlight localization system, we introduce the following definitions. 3.1 Definitions and Problem Formulation Lets assume that the space A ⊂R3 contains all sensor nodes N, and that each node Ni is positioned at pi(x, y, z).",
        "To obtain pi(x, y, z), a Spotlight localization system needs to support three main functions, namely an Event Distribution Function (EDF) E(t), an Event Detection Function D(e), and a Localization Function L(Ti).",
        "They are formally defined as follows: Definition 1: An event e(t, p) is a detectable phenomenon that occurs at time t and at point p є A.",
        "Examples of events are light, heat, smoke, sound, etc.",
        "Let Ti={ti1, ti2, …, tin} be a set of n timestamps of events detected by a node i.",

        "Spotlight system architecture As shown in Figure 2, the Event Detection Function D(e) is supported by the sensor nodes.",
        "It is used to determine whether an external event happens or not.",
        "It can be implemented through either a simple threshold-based detection algorithm or other advanced digital signal processing techniques.",
        "The Event Distribution E(t) and Localization Functions L(Ti) are implemented by a Spotlight device.",
        "The Localization function is an aggregation algorithm which calculates the intersection of multiple sets of points.",
        "The Event Distribution Function E(t) describes the distribution of events over time.",
        "It is the core of the Spotlight system and it is much more sophisticated than the other two functions.",
        "Due to the fact that E(t) is realized by the Spotlight device, the hardware requirements for the sensor nodes remain minimal.",
        "With the support of these three functions, the localization process goes as follows: 1) A Spotlight device distributes events in the space A over a period of time. 2) During the event distribution, sensor nodes record the time sequence Ti = {ti1, ti2, …, tin} at which they detect the events. 3) After the event distribution, each sensor node sends the detection time sequence back to the Spotlight device. 4) The Spotlight device estimates the location of a sensor node i, using the time sequence Ti and the known E(t) function.",
        "The Event Distribution Function E(t) is the core technique used in the Spotlight system and we propose three designs for it.",
        "These designs have different tradeoffs and the cost comparison is presented in Section 3.5. 3.2 Point Scan Event Distribution Function To illustrate the basic functionality of a Spotlight system, we start with a simple sensor system where a set of nodes are placed along a straight line (A = [0, l] R).",
        "The Spotlight device generates point events (e.g. light spots) along this line with constant speed s. The set of timestamps of events detected by a node i is Ti={ti1}.",

        "This allows the implementation of the Area Cover EDF.",
        "The idea of Area Cover EDF is to partition the space A into multiple sections and assign a unique binary identifier, called code, to each section.",

The Area Cover EDF is then defined as follows: ⊂ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = 0iskofbitjthiffalse, 1iskofbitjthiftrue, ),( jkBIT (8) }{ truetkBITSpptE k =∧∈= ),()( and the corresponding localization algorithm is: { ∧∈=∧== )),(()(|)( iki TtiftruetkBITSCOGppTL (9)})`),(( iTTtiffalsetkBIT −∈= where COG(Sk) denotes the center of gravity of Sk.",

        "As shown in Figure 5, the plane A is divided in 16 sections.",
        "Each section Sk has a unique code k. The Spotlight device distributes the events according to these codes: at time j a section Sk is covered by an event (lit by light), if jth bit of k is 1.",
        "A node residing anywhere in the section Sk is localized at the center of gravity of that section.",
        "For example, nodes within section 1010 detect the events at time T = {1, 3}.",
        "At t = 4 the section where each node resides can be determined A more accurate localization requires a finer partitioning of the plane, hence the number of bits in the code will increase.",
        "Considering the noise that is present in a real, outdoor environment, it is easy to observe that a relatively small error in detecting the correct bit pattern could result in a large localization error.",
        "Returning to the example shown in Figure 5, if a sensor node is located in the section with code 0000, and due to the noise, at time t = 3, it thinks it detected an event, it will incorrectly conclude that its code is 1000, and it positions itself two squares below its correct position.",
        "The localization accuracy can deteriorate even further, if multiple errors are present in the transmission of the code.",
        "A natural solution to this problem is to use error-correcting codes, which greatly reduce the probability of an error, without paying the price of a re-transmission, or lengthening the transmission time too much.",
        "Several error correction schemes have been proposed in the past.",
        "Two of the most notable ones are the Hamming (7, 4) code and the Golay (23, 12) code.",
        "Both are perfect linear error correcting codes.",
        "The Hamming coding scheme can detect up to 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors.",
        "In the Hamming (7, 4) scheme, a message having 4 bits of data (e.g. dddd, where d is a data bit) is transmitted as a 7-bit word by adding 3 error control bits (e.g. dddpdpp, where p is a parity bit).",

        "Similar to Hamming (7, 4), Golay constructs a 23-bit codeword from 12-bit data.",

        "The steps of Area Cover EDF with Hamming (7, 4) ECC.",
        "The events cover the shaded areas.",
        "Lets assume a 1-bit error probability of 0.01, and a 12-bit message that needs to be transmitted.",
        "The probability of a failed transmission is thus: 0.11, if no error detection and correction is used; 0.0061 for the Hamming scheme (i.e. more than 1-bit error); and 0.000076 for the Golay scheme (i.e. more than 3-bit errors).",
        "Golay is thus 80 times more robust that the Hamming scheme, which is 20 times more robust than the no error correction scheme. 16 Considering that a limited number of corrections is possible by any coding scheme, a natural question arises: can we minimize the localization error when there are errors that can not be corrected?",
        "This can be achieved by a clever placement of codes in the grid.",
        "As shown in Figure 7, the placement A, in the presence of a 1-bit error has a smaller average localization error when compared to the placement B.",
        "The objective of our code placement strategy is to reduce the total Euclidean distance between all pairs of codes with Hamming distances smaller than K, the largest number of expected 1-bit errors.",
        "Figure 7.",
        "Different code placement strategies Formally, a placement is represented by a function P: [0, l]d → C, which assigns a code to every coordinate in the d-dimensional cube of size l (e.g., in the planar case, we place codes in a 2dimensional grid).",
        "We denote by dE(i, j) the Euclidean distance and by dH(i, j) the Hamming distance between two codes i and j.",
        "In a noisy environment, dH(i,j) determines the crossover probability between the two codes.",

        "To overcome this, we propose a Greedy Placement method to obtain suboptimal results.",
        "In this method we initialize the 2-dimensional grid with codes.",
        "Then we swap the codes within the grid repeatedly, to minimize the objective function.",
        "For each swap, we greedily chose a pair of codes, which can reduce the objective function (Equation 10) the most.",
        "The proposed Greedy Placement method ends when no swap of codes can further minimize the objective function.",

        "Localization error with code placement and Hamming ECC 3.5 Event Distribution Function Analysis Although all three aforementioned techniques are able to localize the sensor nodes, they differ in the localization time, communication overhead and energy consumed by the Event Distribution Function (lets call it Event Overhead).",
        "Lets assume that all sensor nodes are located in a square with edge size D, and that the Spotlight device can generate N events (e.g.",
        "Point, Line and Area Cover events) every second and that the maximum tolerable localization error is r. Table 1 presents the execution cost comparison of the three different Spotlight techniques.",

        "However the Point Scan takes a much longer time than the Area Cover technique, which finishes in logrD seconds.",
        "The Line Scan method trades the Event Overhead well with the localization time.",
        "By doubling the Event Overhead, the Line Scan method takes only r/2D percentage of time to complete, when compared with the Point Scan method.",
        "From Table 1, it can be observed that the execution costs do not depend on the number of sensor nodes to be localized.",
        "It is important to remark the ratio Event Overhead per unit time, which is indicative of the power requirement for the Spotlight device.",
        "This ratio is constant for the Point Scan (r2 *N) while it grows linearly with area, for the Area Cover (D2 *N/2).",
        "If the deployment area is very large, the use of the Area Cover EDF is prohibitively expensive, if not impossible.",
        "For practical purposes, the Area Cover is a viable solution for small to medium size networks, while the Line Scan works well for large networks.",
        "We discuss the implications of the power requirement for the Spotlight device, and offer a hybrid solution in Section 6. 3.6 Localization Error Analysis The accuracy of localization with the Spotlight technique depends on many aspects.",
        "The major factors that were considered during the implementation of the system are discussed below: 17 - Time Synchronization: the Spotlight system exchanges time stamps between sensor nodes and the Spotlight device.",
        "It is necessary for the system to reach consensus on global time through synchronization.",
        "Due to the uncertainty in hardware processing and wireless communication, we can only confine such errors within certain bounds (e.g. one jiffy).",
        "An imprecise input to the Localization Function L(T) leads to an error in node localization. - Uncertainty in Detection: the sampling rate of the sensor nodes is finite, consequently, there will be an unpredictable delay between the time when an event is truly present and when the sensor node detects it.",
        "Lower sampling rates will generate larger localizations errors. - Size of the Event: the events distributed by the Spotlight device can not be infinitely small.",
        "If a node detects one event, it is hard for it to estimate the exact location of itself within the event. - Realization of Event Distribution Function: EDF defines locations of events at time t. Due to the limited accuracy (e.g. mechanical imprecision), a Spotlight device might generate events which locate differently from where these events are supposed to be.",
        "It is important to remark that the localization error is independent of the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
        "This independence, as well as the aforementioned independence of the execution cost, indicate the very good scalability properties (with the number of sensor nodes, but not with the area of deployment) that the Spotlight system possesses. 4.",
        "SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION For our performance evaluation we implemented two Spotlight systems.",
        "Using these two implementations we were able to investigate the full spectrum of Event Distribution techniques, proposed in Section 3, at a reduced one time cost (less than $1,000).",
        "The first implementation, called μSpotlight, had a short range (10-20 meters), however its capability of generating the entire spectrum of EDFs made it very useful.",
        "We used this implementation mainly to investigate the capabilities of the Spotlight system and tune its performance.",
        "It was not intended to represent the full solution, but only a scaled down version of the system.",
        "The second implementation, the Spotlight system, had a much longer range (as far as 6500m), but it was limited in the types of EDFs that it can generate.",
        "The goal of this implementation was to show how the Spotlight system works in a real, outdoor environment, and show correlations with the experimental results obtained from the μSpotlight system implementation.",
        "In the remaining part of this section, we describe how we implemented the three components (Event Distribution, Event Detection and Localization functions) of the Spotlight architecture, and the time synchronization protocol, a key component of our system. 4.1 µSpotlight System The first system we built, called μSpotlight, used as the Spotlight device, an Infocus LD530 projector connected to an IBM Thinkpad laptop.",
        "The system is shown in Figure 10.",
        "The Event Distribution Function was implemented as a Java GUI.",
        "Due to the stringent timing requirements and the delay caused by the buffering in the windowing system of a PC, we used the Full-Screen Exclusive Mode API provided by Java2.",
        "This allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector, hence a higher accuracy of timestamps of events.",
        "Because of the 50Hz refresh rate of our projector, there was still an uncertainty in the time stamping of the events of 20msec.",
        "We explored the possibility of using and modifying the Linux kernel to expose the vertical synch (VSYNCH) interrupt, generated by the displaying device after each screen refresh, out of the kernel mode.",
        "The performance evaluation results showed, however, that this level of accuracy was not needed.",
        "The sensor nodes that we used were Berkeley Mica2 motes equipped with MTS310 multi-sensor boards from Crossbow.",
        "This sensor board contains a CdSe photo sensor which can detect the light from the projector.",
        "Figure 10. μSpotlight system implementation With this implementation of the Spotlight system, we were able to generate Point, Line and Area Scan events. 4.2 Spotlight System The second Spotlight system we built used, as the Spotlight device, diode lasers, a computerized telescope mount (Celestron CG-5GT, shown in Figure 11), and an IBM Thinkpad laptop.",
        "The laptop was connected, through RS232 interfaces, to the telescope mount and to one XSM600CA [7] mote, acting as a base station.",
        "The diode lasers we used ranged in power from 7mW to 35mW.",
        "They emitted at 650nm, close to the point of highest sensitivity for CdSe photosensor.",

        "Spotlight system implementation The telescope mount has worm gears for a smooth motion and high precision angular measurements.",
        "The two angular measures that we used were the, so called, Alt (from Altitude) and Az (from Azimuth).",
        "In astronomy, the Altitude of a celestial object is its angular distance above or below the celestial horizon, and the Azimuth is the angular distance of an object eastwards of the meridian, along the horizon. 18 The laptop computer, through a Java GUI, controls the motion of the telescope mount, orienting it such that a full Point Scan of an area is performed, similar to the one described in Figure 3(b).",
        "For each turning point i, the 3-tuple (Alti and Azi angles and the timestamp ti) is recorded.",
        "The Spotlight system uses the timestamp received from a sensor node j, to obtain the angular measures Altj and Azj for its location.",
        "For the sensor nodes, we used XSM motes, mainly because of their longer communication range.",
        "The XSM mote has the photo sensor embedded in its main board.",
        "We had to make minor adjustments to the plastic housing, in order to expose the photo sensor to the outside.",
        "The same mote code, written in nesC, for TinyOS, was used for both µSpotlight and Spotlight system implementations. 4.3 Event Detection Function D(t) The Event Detection Function aims to detect the beginning of an event and record the time when the event was observed.",
        "We implemented a very simple detection function based on the observed maximum value.",
        "An event i will be time stamped with time ti, if the reading from the photo sensor dti, fulfills the condition: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor before ti and Δ is a constant which ensures that the first large detection gives the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variations around the first large signal are not considered).",
        "Hence Δ guarantees that only sharp changes in the detected value generate an observed event. 4.4 Localization Function L(T) The Localization Function is implemented in the Java GUI.",
        "It matches the timestamps created by the Event Distribution Function with those reported by the sensor nodes.",

        "If the following condition is true: nei dd = where en is an event with code den, then the inferred location for node i is: nn ee yyxx == , 4.5 Time Synchronization The time synchronization in the Spotlight system consists of two parts: - Synchronization between sensor nodes: This is achieved through the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol [18].",
        "In this protocol, synchronized nodes (the root node is the only synchronized node at the beginning) send time synchronization message to unsynchronized nodes.",
        "The sender puts the time stamp into the synchronization message right before the bytes containing the time stamp are transmitted.",
        "Once a receiver gets the message, it follows the senders time and performs the necessary calculations to compensate for the clock drift. - Synchronization between the sensor nodes and the Spotlight device: We implemented this part through a two-way handshaking between the Spotlight device and one node, used as the base station.",

        "Two-way synchronization As shown in Figure 12, lets assume that the Spotlight device sends a synchronization message (SYNC) at local time T1, the sensor node receives it at its local time T2 and acknowledges it at local time T3 (both T2 and T3 are sent back through ACK).",
        "After the Spotlight device receives the ACK, at its local time T4, the time synchronization can be achieved as follows: 2 )()( 4312 TTTT Offset −+− = (11) OffsetTTT spotlightnodeglobal +== We note that Equation 11 assumes that the one trip delays are the same in both directions.",
        "In practice this does not hold well enough.",

        "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
        "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
        "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
        "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
        "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
        "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
        "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
        "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
        "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
        "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
        "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
        "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
        "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
        "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
        "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
        "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
        "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
        "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
        "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
        "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",

        "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
        "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
        "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
        "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",

        "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
        "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
        "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
        "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
        "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
        "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
        "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",
                "Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.",

                "Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes.",
                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",

                "At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.",

                "We were interested in measuring the range of our Spotlight system, considering our capabilities (MTS310 sensor board and inexpensive, $12-$85, diode laser).",
                "As a result, we measured the intensity of the laser beam, having the same focus, at different distances.",
                "The results are shown in Figure 29. 950 1000 1050 1100 0 50 100 150 200 Distance [m] Intensity[ADCcount] 35mW 7mW Figure 29.",
                "<br>localization</br> Range for the Spotlight system From Figure 29, it can be observed that only a minor decrease in the intensity occurs, due to absorption and possibly our imperfect focusing of the laser beam.",
                "A linear fit of the experimental data shows that distances of up to 6500m can be achieved.",
                "While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can easily be achieved.",
                "The angle between the laser beam and the vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual projection of the beam on the ground.",
                "In a similar manner, we were interested in finding out the maximum size of an event, that can be generated by a COTS laser and that is detectable by the existing photosensor.",
                "For this, we 23 varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light intensity, as given by the ADC count.",
                "The results are shown in Figure 30.",
                "It can be observed that for the less powerful laser, an event size of 1.5m is the limit.",
                "For the more powerful laser, the event size can be as high as 4m.",
                "Through our extensive performance evaluation results, we have shown that the Spotlight system is a feasible, highly accurate, low cost solution for <br>localization</br> of wireless sensor networks.",
                "From our experience with sources of laser radiation, we believe that for small and medium size sensor network deployments, in areas of less than 20,000m2 , the Area Cover scheme is a viable solution.",
                "For large size sensor network deployments, the Line Scan, or an incremental use of the Area Cover are very good options. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 0 50 100 150 200 Event Size [cm] Intensity[ADCcount] 35mW 7mW Figure 30.",

                "OPTIMIZATIONS/LESSONS LEARNED 6.1 Distributed Spotlight System The proposed design and the implementation of the Spotlight system can be considered centralized, due to the gathering of the sensor data and the execution of the <br>localization</br> Function L(t) by the Spotlight device.",
                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the <br>localization</br> Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 <br>localization</br> Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the <br>localization</br> time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger <br>localization</br> errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete <br>localization</br> procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative <br>localization</br> (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the <br>localization</br> procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a <br>localization</br> system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our <br>localization</br> solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our <br>localization</br> system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the <br>localization</br> error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based <br>localization</br> systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general <br>localization</br> techniques. 8.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",
                "Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.",

                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",

                "At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the <br>range-based localization</br> schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.",

                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.",

                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",

                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",

                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.",

                "It is necessary for the system to reach consensus on global time through synchronization.",

                "While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can easily be achieved.",
                "The angle between the laser beam and the vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual projection of the beam on the ground.",
                "In a similar manner, we were interested in finding out the maximum size of an event, that can be generated by a COTS laser and that is detectable by the existing photosensor.",
                "For this, we 23 varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light intensity, as given by the ADC count.",
                "The results are shown in Figure 30.",
                "It can be observed that for the less powerful laser, an event size of 1.5m is the limit.",

                "OPTIMIZATIONS/LESSONS LEARNED 6.1 Distributed Spotlight System The proposed design and the implementation of the Spotlight system can be considered centralized, due to the gathering of the sensor data and the execution of the Localization Function L(t) by the Spotlight device.",
                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our <br>performance</br> evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its <br>performance</br> is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",

                "Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes.",
                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",
                "In addition, the radio propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment dependent, thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free localizations schemes.",
                "With such limitations in mind, this paper addresses the following research challenge: How to reconcile the need for high <br>accuracy</br> in location estimation with the cost to achieve it.",

                "At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2.",

                "Using these two implementations we were able to investigate the full spectrum of Event Distribution techniques, proposed in Section 3, at a reduced one time cost (less than $1,000).",
                "The first implementation, called μSpotlight, had a short range (10-20 meters), however its capability of generating the entire spectrum of EDFs made it very useful.",
                "We used this implementation mainly to investigate the capabilities of the Spotlight system and tune its performance.",
                "It was not intended to represent the full solution, but only a scaled down version of the system.",
                "The second implementation, the Spotlight system, had a much longer range (as far as 6500m), but it was limited in the types of EDFs that it can generate.",

                "This allowed us to bypass the windowing system and more precisely estimate the time when an event is displayed by the projector, hence a higher <br>accuracy</br> of timestamps of events.",
                "Because of the 50Hz refresh rate of our projector, there was still an uncertainty in the time stamping of the events of 20msec.",
                "We explored the possibility of using and modifying the Linux kernel to expose the vertical synch (VSYNCH) interrupt, generated by the displaying device after each screen refresh, out of the kernel mode.",

                "The same mote code, written in nesC, for TinyOS, was used for both µSpotlight and Spotlight system implementations. 4.3 Event Detection Function D(t) The Event Detection Function aims to detect the beginning of an event and record the time when the event was observed.",
                "We implemented a very simple detection function based on the observed maximum value.",
                "An event i will be time stamped with time ti, if the reading from the photo sensor dti, fulfills the condition: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor before ti and Δ is a constant which ensures that the first large detection gives the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variations around the first large signal are not considered).",

                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The <br>accuracy</br> of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",
                "Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.",

                "Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes.",
                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",
                "In addition, the radio propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment dependent, thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free localizations schemes.",
                "With such limitations in mind, this paper addresses the following research challenge: How to reconcile the need for high accuracy in location estimation with the cost to achieve it.",
                "Our answer to this challenge is a localization system called Spotlight.",
                "This system employs an asymmetric architecture, in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware, other than what they currently have.",
                "All the sophisticated hardware and computation reside on a single Spotlight device.",
                "The Spotlight device uses a steerable laser light source, illuminating the sensor nodes placed within a known terrain.",
                "We demonstrate that this localization is much more accurate (i.e., tens of centimeters) than the range-based localization schemes and that it has a much longer effective range (i.e., thousands of meters) than the solutions based on ultra-sound/acoustic ranging.",
                "At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.",

                "Due to the high cost and non-negligible form factor of the ranging hardware, these solutions can not be simply applied to sensor networks.",
                "The RSSI has been an attractive solution for estimating the distance between the sender and the receiver.",
                "The RADAR system [2] uses the RSSI to build a centralized repository of signal strengths at various positions with respect to a set of beacon nodes.",

                "Localization Range for the Spotlight system From Figure 29, it can be observed that only a minor decrease in the intensity occurs, due to absorption and possibly our imperfect focusing of the laser beam.",
                "A linear fit of the experimental data shows that distances of up to 6500m can be achieved.",
                "While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can easily be achieved.",
                "The angle between the laser beam and the vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual projection of the beam on the ground.",
                "In a similar manner, we were interested in finding out the maximum size of an event, that can be generated by a COTS laser and that is detectable by the existing photosensor.",
                "For this, we 23 varied the divergence of the laser beam and measured the light intensity, as given by the ADC count.",
                "The results are shown in Figure 30.",
                "It can be observed that for the less powerful laser, an event size of 1.5m is the limit.",

                "OPTIMIZATIONS/LESSONS LEARNED 6.1 Distributed Spotlight System The proposed design and the implementation of the Spotlight system can be considered centralized, due to the gathering of the sensor data and the execution of the Localization Function L(t) by the Spotlight device.",
                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the <br>sensor network</br>.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the <br>sensor network</br> topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the <br>sensor network</br>.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the <br>sensor network</br> was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless <br>sensor network</br> technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the <br>sensor network</br> is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",
                "Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.",

                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",

                "While many middleware services, to support these applications, have been designed and implemented successfully, localization - finding the position of sensor nodes - remains one of the most difficult research challenges to be solved practically.",
                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",
                "Many approaches have been proposed in the literature [4] [6] [13] [14] [19] [20] [21] [23] [27] [28], however it is still not clear how these solutions can be practically and economically deployed.",

                "Other solutions require per node devices that can perform ranging among neighboring nodes.",
                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",
                "In addition, the radio propagation characteristics vary over time and are environment dependent, thus imposing high calibration costs for the range-free localizations schemes.",
                "With such limitations in mind, this paper addresses the following research challenge: How to reconcile the need for high accuracy in location estimation with the cost to achieve it.",
                "Our answer to this challenge is a localization system called Spotlight.",
                "This system employs an asymmetric architecture, in which sensor nodes do not need any additional hardware, other than what they currently have.",
                "All the sophisticated hardware and computation reside on a single Spotlight device.",
                "The Spotlight device uses a steerable laser light source, illuminating the sensor nodes placed within a known terrain.",

                "At the same time, since only a single sophisticated device is needed to localize the whole network, the amortized cost is much smaller than the cost to add hardware components to the individual sensors. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK In this section, we discuss prior work in localization in two major categories: the range-based localization schemes (which use either expensive, per node, ranging devices for high accuracy, or less accurate ranging solutions, as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)), and the range-free schemes, which use only connectivity information (hop-by-hop) as an indication of proximity among the nodes.",

                "While we do not expect atmospheric conditions, over large distances, to be similar to our 200m evaluation, there is strong evidence that distances (i.e. altitude) of 1000-2000m can easily be achieved.",
                "The angle between the laser beam and the vertical should be minimized (less than 45°), as it reduces the difference between the beam cross-section (event size) and the actual projection of the beam on the ground.",

                "OPTIMIZATIONS/LESSONS LEARNED 6.1 Distributed Spotlight System The proposed design and the implementation of the Spotlight system can be considered centralized, due to the gathering of the sensor data and the execution of the Localization Function L(t) by the Spotlight device.",
                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event Distribution Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general <br>localization technique</br>s. 8.",

                "The difficulties of these approaches are twofold.",
                "First, under constraints of form factor and power supply, the effective ranges of such devices are very limited.",
                "For example the effective range of the ultrasonic transducers used in the Cricket system is less than 2 meters when the sender and receiver are not facing each other [26].",
                "Second, since most sensor nodes are static, i.e. the location is not expected to change, it is not cost-effective to equip these sensors with special circuitry just for a one-time localization.",
                "To overcome these limitations, many range-free localization schemes have been proposed.",
                "Most of these schemes estimate the location of sensor nodes by exploiting the radio connectivity information among neighboring nodes.",
                "These approaches eliminate the need of high-cost specialized hardware, at the cost of a less accurate localization.",

                "We show that this design can easily be transformed into a distributed one, by offering two solutions.",
                "One idea is to disseminate in the network, information about the path of events, generated by the EDF (similar to an equation, describing a path), and let the sensor nodes execute the Localization Function.",
                "For example, in the Line Scan scenario, if the starting and ending points for the horizontal and vertical scans, and the times they were reached, are propagated in the network, then any sensor in the network can obtain its location (assuming a constant scanning speed).",
                "A second solution is to use anchor nodes which know their positions.",
                "In the case of Line Scan, if three anchors are present, after detecting the presence of the two events, the anchors flood the network with their locations and times of detection.",
                "Using the same simple formulas as in the previous scheme, all sensor nodes can infer their positions. 6.2 Localization Overhead Reduction Another requirement imposed by the Spotlight system design, is the use of a time synchronization protocol between the Spotlight device and the sensor network.",
                "Relaxing this requirement and imposing only a time synchronization protocol among sensor nodes is a very desirable objective.",
                "The idea is to use the knowledge that the Spotlight device has about the speed with which the scanning of the sensor field takes place.",
                "If the scanning speed is constant (lets call it s), then the time difference (lets call it Δt) between the event detections of two sensor nodes is, in fact, an accurate measure of the range between them: d=s*Δt.",
                "Hence, the Spotlight system can be used for accurate ranging of the distance between any pair of sensor nodes.",
                "An important observation is that this ranging technique does not suffer from limitations of others: small range and directionality for ultrasound, or irregularity, fading and multipath for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).",
                "After the ranges between nodes have been determined (either in a centralized or distributed manner) graph embedding algorithms can be used for a realization of a rigid graph, describing the sensor network topology. 6.3 Dynamic Event <br>distribution</br> Function E(t) Another system optimization is for environments where the sensor node density is not uniform.",
                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event <br>distribution</br> Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. laser) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the laser radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the <br>distribution</br> of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",

                "Since most emerging applications based on networked sensor nodes require location awareness to assist their operations, such as annotating sensed data with location context, it is an indispensable requirement for a sensor node to be able to find its own location.",

                "One disadvantage of the Line Scan technique, when compared to the Area Cover, is the localization time.",
                "An idea is to use two scans: one which uses a large event size (hence larger localization errors), followed by a second scan in which the event size changes dynamically.",
                "The first scan is used for identifying the areas with a higher density of sensor nodes.",
                "The second scan uses a larger event in areas where the sensor node density is low and a smaller event in areas with a higher sensor node density.",
                "A dynamic EDF can also be used when it is very difficult to meet the power requirements for the Spotlight device (imposed by the use of the Area Cover scheme in a very large area).",
                "In this scenario, a hybrid scheme can be used: the first scan (Point Scan) is performed quickly, with a very large event size, and it is meant to identify, roughly, the location of the sensor network.",
                "Subsequent Area Cover scans will be executed on smaller portions of the network, until the entire deployment area is localized. 6.4 Stealthiness Our implementation of the Spotlight system used visible light for creating events.",
                "Using the system during the daylight or in a room well lit, poses challenges due to the solar or fluorescent lamp radiation, which generate a strong background noise.",
                "The alternative, which we used in our performance evaluations, was to use the system in a dark room (μSpotlight system) or during the night (Spotlight system).",
                "While using the Spotlight system during the night is a good solution for environments where stealthiness is not important (e.g. environmental sciences) for others (e.g. military applications), divulging the presence and location of a sensor field, could seriously compromise the efficacy of the system.",
                "Figure 31.",
                "Fluorescent Light Spectra (top), Spectral Response for CdSe cells (bottom) A solution to this problem, which we experimented with in the µSpotlight system, was to use an optical filter on top of the light 24 sensor.",
                "The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31-bottom).",
                "As shown in Figure 31-top, the fluorescent light has no significant components above 700nm.",
                "Hence, a simple red filter (Schott RG-630), which transmits all light with wavelength approximately above 630nm, coupled with an Event Distribution Function that generates events with wavelengths above the same threshold, would allow the use of the system when a fluorescent light is present.",
                "A solution for the Spotlight system to be stealthy at night, is to use a source of infra-red radiation (i.e. <br>laser</br>) emitting in the range [750, 1000]nm.",
                "For a daylight use of the Spotlight system, the challenge is to overcome the strong background of the natural light.",
                "A solution we are considering is the use of a narrow-band optical filter, centered at the wavelength of the <br>laser</br> radiation.",
                "The feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of this solution remain to be proven. 6.5 Network Deployed in Unknown Terrain A further generalization is when the map of the terrain where the sensor network was deployed is unknown.",
                "While this is highly unlikely for many civil applications of wireless sensor network technologies, it is not difficult to imagine military applications where the sensor network is deployed in a hostile and unknown terrain.",
                "A solution to this problem is a system that uses two Spotlight devices, or equivalently, the use of the same device from two distinct positions, executing, from each of them, a complete localization procedure.",
                "In this scheme, the position of the sensor node is uniquely determined by the intersection of the two location directions obtained by the system.",
                "The relative localization (for each pair of Spotlight devices) will require an accurate knowledge of the 3 translation and 3 rigid-body rotation parameters for Spotlights position and orientation (as mentioned in Section 3).",
                "This generalization is also applicable to scenarios where, due to terrain variations, there is no single aerial point with a direct line of sight to all sensor nodes, e.g. hilly terrain.",
                "By executing the localization procedure from different aerial points, the probability of establishing a line of sight with all the nodes, increases.",
                "For some military scenarios [1] [12], where open terrain is prevalent, the existence of a line of sight is not a limiting factor.",
                "In light of this, the Spotlight system can not be used in forests or indoor environments. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a localization system for wireless sensor networks, called Spotlight.",
                "Our localization solution does not require any additional hardware for the sensor nodes, other than what already exists.",
                "All the complexity of the system is encapsulated into a single Spotlight device.",
                "Our localization system is reusable, i.e. the costs can be amortized through several deployments, and its performance is not affected by the number of sensor nodes in the network.",
                "Our experimental results, obtained from a real system deployed outdoors, show that the localization error is less than 20cm.",
                "This error is currently state of art, even for range-based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].",
                "As future work, we would like to explore the self-calibration and self-tuning of the Spotlight system.",
                "The accuracy of the system can be further improved if the distribution of the event, instead of a single timestamp, is reported.",
                "A generalization could be obtained by reformulating the problem as an angular estimation problem that provides the building blocks for more general localization techniques. 8.",
                "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the DARPA IXO office, under the NEST project (grant number F336616-01-C-1905) and by the NSF grant CCR-0098269.",
