In this paper we propose to improve such Web queries by expanding them with terms collected from each users Personal Information Repository, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. We introduce five broad techniques for generating the additional query keywords by analyzing user data at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and compound level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics, as well as to using external thesauri. Our extensive empirical analysis under four different scenarios shows some of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing a very strong increase in the quality of the output rankings. Subsequently, we move this personalized search framework one step further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to various features of each query. A separate set of experiments indicates the adaptive algorithms to bring an additional statistically significant improvement over the best static expansion approach.

INTRODUCTION The booming popularity of search engines has determined simple keyword search to become the only widely accepted user interface for seeking information over the Web. Yet keyword queries are inherently ambiguous. The query canon book for example covers several different areas of interest: religion, photography, literature, and music. Clearly, one would prefer search output to be aligned with users topic(s) of interest, rather than displaying a selection of popular URLs from each category. Studies have shown that more than 80% of the users would prefer to receive such personalized search results [33] instead of the currently generic ones. Query expansion assists the user in formulating a better query, by appending additional keywords to the initial search request in order to encapsulate her interests therein, as well as to focus the Web search output accordingly. It has been shown to perform very well over large data sets, especially with short input queries (see for example [19, 3]). This is exactly the Web search scenario! In this paper we propose to enhance Web query reformulation by exploiting the users Personal Information Repository (PIR), i.e., the personal collection of text documents, emails, cached Web pages, etc. Several advantages arise when moving Web search personalization down to the Desktop level (note that by Desktop we refer to PIR, and we use the two terms interchangeably). First is of course the quality of personalization: The local Desktop is a rich repository of information, accurately describing most, if not all interests of the user. Second, as all profile information is stored and exploited locally, on the personal machine, another very important benefit is privacy. Search engines should not be able to know about a persons interests, i.e., they should not be able to connect a specific person with the queries she issued, or worse, with the output URLs she clicked within the search interface1 (see Volokh [35] for a discussion on privacy issues related to personalized Web search). Our algorithms expand Web queries with keywords extracted from users PIR, thus implicitly personalizing the search output. After a discussion of previous works in Section 2, we first investigate the analysis of local Desktop query context in Section 3.1.1. We propose several keyword, expression, and summary based techniques for determining expansion terms from those personal documents matching the Web query best. In Section 3.1.2 we move our analysis to the global Desktop collection and investigate expansions based on co-occurrence metrics and external thesauri. The experiments presented in Section 3.2 show many of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing NDCG [15] improvements of up to 51.28%. In Section 4 we move this algorithmic framework further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to the clarity level of the query. This yields an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best algorithm. We conclude and discuss further work in Section 5. 1 Search engines can map queries at least to IP addresses, for example by using cookies and mining the query logs. However, by moving the user profile at the Desktop level we ensure such information is not explicitly associated to a particular user and stored on the search engine side. 2. PREVIOUS WORK This paper brings together two IR areas: Search Personalization and Automatic Query Expansion. There exists a vast amount of algorithms for both domains. However, not much has been done specifically aimed at combining them. In this section we thus present a separate analysis, first introducing some approaches to personalize search, as this represents the main goal of our research, and then discussing several query expansion techniques and their relationship to our algorithms. 2.1 Personalized Search Personalized search comprises two major components: (1) User profiles, and (2) The actual search algorithm. This section splits the relevant background according to the focus of each article into either one of these elements. Approaches focused on the User Profile. Sugiyama et al. [32] analyzed surfing behavior and generated user profiles as features (terms) of the visited pages. Upon issuing a new query, the search results were ranked based on the similarity between each URL and the user profile. Qiu and Cho [26] used Machine Learning on the past click history of the user in order to determine topic preference vectors and then apply Topic-Sensitive PageRank [13]. User profiling based on browsing history has the advantage of being rather easy to obtain and process. This is probably why it is also employed by several industrial search engines (e.g., Yahoo! MyWeb2 ). However, it is definitely not sufficient for gathering a thorough insight into users interests. More, it requires to store all personal information at the server side, which raises significant privacy concerns. Only two other approaches enhanced Web search using Desktop data, yet both used different core ideas: (1) Teevan et al. [34] modified the query term weights from the BM25 weighting scheme to incorporate user interests as captured by their Desktop indexes; (2) In Chirita et al. [6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests. Moreover, none of these investigated the adaptive application of personalization. Approaches focused on the Personalization Algorithm. Effectively building the personalization aspect directly into PageRank [25] (i.e., by biasing it on a target set of pages) has received much attention recently. Haveliwala [13] computed a topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity between the user query and each of the 16 topics. More recently, Nie et al. [24] modified the idea by distributing the PageRank of a page across the topics it contains in order to generate topic oriented rankings. Jeh and Widom [16] proposed an algorithm that avoids the massive resources needed for storing one Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV) per user by precomputing PPVs only for a small set of pages and then applying linear combination. As the computation of PPVs for larger sets of pages was still quite expensive, several solutions have been investigated, the most important ones being those of Fogaras and Racz [12], and Sarlos et al. [30], the latter using rounding and count-min sketching in order to fastly obtain accurate enough approximations of the personalized scores. 2.2 Automatic Query Expansion Automatic query expansion aims at deriving a better formulation of the user query in order to enhance retrieval. It is based on exploiting various social or collection specific characteristics in order to generate additional terms, which are appended to the original in2 http://myWeb2.search.yahoo.com put keywords before identifying the matching documents returned as output. In this section we survey some of the representative query expansion works grouped according to the source employed to generate additional terms: (1) Relevance feedback, (2) Collection based co-occurrence statistics, and (3) Thesaurus information. Some other approaches are also addressed in the end of the section. Relevance Feedback Techniques. The main idea of Relevance Feedback (RF) is that useful information can be extracted from the relevant documents returned for the initial query. First approaches were manual [28] in the sense that the user was the one choosing the relevant results, and then various methods were applied to extract new terms, related to the query and the selected documents. Efthimiadis [11] presented a comprehensive literature review and proposed several simple methods to extract such new keywords based on term frequency, document frequency, etc. We used some of these as inspiration for our Desktop specific techniques. Chang and Hsu [5] asked users to choose relevant clusters, instead of documents, thus reducing the amount of interaction necessary. RF has also been shown to be effectively automatized by considering the top ranked documents as relevant [37] (this is known as Pseudo RF). Lam and Jones [21] used summarization to extract informative sentences from the top-ranked documents, and appended them to the user query. Carpineto et al. [4] maximized the divergence between the language model defined by the top retrieved documents and that defined by the entire collection. Finally, Yu et al. [38] selected the expansion terms from vision-based segments of Web pages in order to cope with the multiple topics residing therein. Co-occurrence Based Techniques. Terms highly co-occurring with the issued keywords have been shown to increase precision when appended to the query [17]. Many statistical measures have been developed to best assess term relationship levels, either analyzing entire documents [27], lexical affinity relationships [3] (i.e., pairs of closely related words which contain exactly one of the initial query terms), etc. We have also investigated three such approaches in order to identify query relevant keywords from the rich, yet rather complex Personal Information Repository. Thesaurus Based Techniques. A broadly explored method is to expand the user query with new terms, whose meaning is closely related to the input keywords. Such relationships are usually extracted from large scale thesauri, as WordNet [23], in which various sets of synonyms, hypernyms, etc. are predefined. Just as for the co-occurrence methods, initial experiments with this approach were controversial, either reporting improvements, or even reductions in output quality [36]. Recently, as the experimental collections grew larger, and as the employed algorithms became more complex, better results have been obtained [31, 18, 22]. We also use WordNet based expansion terms. However, we base this process on analyzing the Desktop level relationship between the original query and the proposed new keywords. Other Techniques. There are many other attempts to extract expansion terms. Though orthogonal to our approach, two works are very relevant for the Web environment: Cui et al. [8] generated word correlations utilizing the probability for query terms to appear in each document, as computed over the search engine logs. Kraft and Zien [19] showed that anchor text is very similar to user queries, and thus exploited it to acquire additional keywords. 3. QUERY EXPANSION USING DESKTOP DATA Desktop data represents a very rich repository of profiling information. However, this information comes in a very unstructured way, covering documents which are highly diverse in format, content, and even language characteristics. In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository. Then, in the second part of the section we empirically analyze the performance of each approach. 3.1 Algorithms This section presents the five generic approaches for analyzing users Desktop data in order to provide expansion terms for Web search. In the proposed algorithms we gradually increase the amount of personal information utilized. Thus, in the first part we investigate three local analysis techniques focused only on those Desktop documents matching users query best. We append to the Web query the most relevant terms, compounds, and sentence summaries from these documents. In the second part of the section we move towards a global Desktop analysis, proposing to investigate term co-occurrences, as well as thesauri, in the expansion process. 3.1.1 Expanding with Local Desktop Analysis Local Desktop Analysis is related to enhancing Pseudo Relevance Feedback to generate query expansion keywords from the PIR best hits for users Web query, rather than from the top ranked Web search results. We distinguish three granularity levels for this process and we investigate each of them separately. Term and Document Frequency. As the simplest possible measures, TF and DF have the advantage of being very fast to compute. Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11]. We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics. The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document. This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10]. The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query. The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request. This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise. Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with. Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores. Note that a hybrid TFxIDF approach is not necessarily efficient, since one Desktop term might have a high DF on the Desktop, while being quite rare in the Web. For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF. However, as it is rather rare in the Web, it would make a good resolution of the query towards the correct topic. Lexical Compounds. Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set. Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1]. We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository. Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time. Sentence Selection. This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output. Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences). Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line. We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein. A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details). The second term is a position score set to (Avg(NS) − SentenceIndex)/Avg2 (NS) for the first ten sentences, and to 0 otherwise, Avg(NS) being the average number of sentences over all Desktop items. This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning. However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant. The final term biases the summary towards the query. It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query. It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms. In this section we propose two such techniques, namely term co-occurrence statistics, and filtering the output of an external thesaurus. Term Co-occurrence Statistics. For each term, we can easily compute off-line those terms co-occurring with it most frequently in a given collection (i.e., PIR in our case), and then exploit this information at run-time in order to infer keywords highly correlated with the user query. Our generic co-occurrence based query expansion algorithm is as follows: Algorithm 3.1.2.1. Co-occurrence based keyword similarity search. Off-line computation: 1: Filter potential keywords k with DF ∈ [10, . . . , 20% · N] 2: For each keyword ki 3: For each keyword kj 4: Compute SCki,kj , the similarity coefficient of (ki, kj) On-line computation: 1: Let S be the set of keywords, potentially similar to an input expression E. 2: For each keyword k of E: 3: S ← S ∪ TSC(k), where TSC(k) contains the Top-K terms most similar to k 4: For each term t of S: 5a: Let Score(t) ← Q k∈E(0.01 + SCt,k) 5b: Let Score(t) ← #DesktopHits(E|t) 6: Select Top-K terms of S with the highest scores. The off-line computation needs an initial trimming phase (step 1) for optimization purposes. In addition, we also restricted the algorithm to computing co-occurrence levels across nouns only, as they contain by far the largest amount of conceptual information, and as this approach reduces the size of the co-occurrence matrix considerably. During the run-time phase, having the terms most correlated with each particular query keyword already identified, one more operation is necessary, namely calculating the correlation of every output term with the entire query. Two approaches are possible: (1) using a product of the correlation between the term and all keywords in the original expression (step 5a), or (2) simply counting the number of documents in which the proposed term co-occurs with the entire user query (step 5b). We considered the following formulas for Similarity Coefficients [17]: • Cosine Similarity, defined as: CS = DFx,y pDFx · DFy (2) • Mutual Information, defined as: MI = log N · DFx,y DFx · DFy (3) • Likelihood Ratio, defined in the paragraphs below. DFx is the Document Frequency of term x, and DFx,y is the number of documents containing both x and y. To further increase the quality of the generated scores we limited the latter indicator to cooccurrences within a window of W terms. We set W to be the same as the maximum amount of expansion keywords desired. Dunnings Likelihood Ratio λ [9] is a co-occurrence based metric similar to χ2 . It starts by attempting to reject the null hypothesis, according to which two terms A and B would appear in text independently from each other. This means that P(A B) = P(A¬B) = P(A), where P(A¬B) is the probability that term A is not followed by term B. Consequently, the test for independence of A and B can be performed by looking if the distribution of A given that B is present is the same as the distribution of A given that B is not present. Of course, in reality we know these terms are not independent in text, and we only use the statistical metrics to highlight terms which are frequently appearing together. We compare the two binomial processes by using likelihood ratios of their associated hypotheses. First, let us define the likelihood ratio for one hypothesis: λ = maxω∈Ω0 H(ω; k) maxω∈Ω H(ω; k) (4) where ω is a point in the parameter space Ω, Ω0 is the particular hypothesis being tested, and k is a point in the space of observations K. If we assume that two binomial distributions have the same underlying parameter, i.e., {(p1, p2) | p1 = p2}, we can write: λ = maxp H(p, p; k1, k2, n1, n2) maxp1,p2 H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) (5) where H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) = pk1 1 · (1 − p1)(n1−k1) ·  n1 k1 ¡ · pk2 2 · (1 − p2)(n2−k2) ·  n2 k2 ¡ . Since the maxima are obtained with p1 = k1 n1 , p2 = k2 n2 , and p = k1+k2 n1+n2 , we have: λ = maxp L(p, k1, n1)L(p, k2, n2) maxp1,p2 L(p1, k1, n1)L(p2, k2, n2) (6) where L(p, k, n) = pk · (1 − p)n−k . Taking the logarithm of the likelihood, we obtain: −2 · log λ = 2 · [log L(p1, k1, n1) + log L(p2, k2, n2) − log L(p, k1, n1) − log L(p, k2, n2)] where log L(p, k, n) = k · log p + (n − k) · log(1 − p). Finally, if we write O11 = P(A B), O12 = P(¬A B), O21 = P(A ¬B), and O22 = P(¬A¬B), then the co-occurrence likelihood of terms A and B becomes: −2 · log λ = 2 · [O11 · log p1 + O12 · log (1 − p1) + O21 · log p2 + O22 · log (1 − p2) − (O11 + O21) · log p − (O12 + O22) · log (1 − p)] where p1 = k1 n1 = O11 O11+O12 , p2 = k2 n2 = O21 O21+O22 , and p = k1+k2 n1+n2 Thesaurus Based Expansion. Large scale thesauri encapsulate global knowledge about term relationships. Thus, we first identify the set of terms closely related to each query keyword, and then we calculate the Desktop co-occurrence level of each of these possible expansion terms with the entire initial search request. In the end, those suggestions with the highest frequencies are kept. The algorithm is as follows: Algorithm 3.1.2.2. Filtered thesaurus based query expansion. 1: For each keyword k of an input query Q: 2: Select the following sets of related terms using WordNet: 2a: Syn: All Synonyms 2b: Sub: All sub-concepts residing one level below k 2c: Super: All super-concepts residing one level above k 3: For each set Si of the above mentioned sets: 4: For each term t of Si: 5: Search the PIR with (Q|t), i.e., the original query, as expanded with t 6: Let H be the number of hits of the above search (i.e., the co-occurence level of t with Q) 7: Return Top-K terms as ordered by their H values. We observe three types of term relationships (steps 2a-2c): (1) synonyms, (2) sub-concepts, namely hyponyms (i.e., sub-classes) and meronyms (i.e., sub-parts), and (3) super-concepts, namely hypernyms (i.e., super-classes) and holonyms (i.e., super-parts). As they represent quite different types of association, we investigated them separately. We limited the output expansion set (step 7) to contain only terms appearing at least T times on the Desktop, in order to avoid noisy suggestions, with T = min( N DocsPerTopic , MinDocs). We set DocsPerTopic = 2, 500, and MinDocs = 5, the latter one coping with the case of small PIRs. 3.2 Experiments 3.2.1 Experimental Setup We evaluated our algorithms with 18 subjects (Ph.D. and PostDoc. students in different areas of computer science and education). First, they installed our Lucene based search engine3 and 3 Clearly, if one had already installed a Desktop search application, then this overhead would not be present. indexed all their locally stored content: Files within user selected paths, Emails, and Web Cache. Without loss of generality, we focused the experiments on single-user machines. Then, they chose 4 queries related to their everyday activities, as follows: • One very frequent AltaVista query, as extracted from the top 2% queries most issued to the search engine within a 7.2 million entries log from October 2001. In order to connect such a query to each users interests, we added an off-line preprocessing phase: We generated the most frequent search requests and then randomly selected a query with at least 10 hits on each subjects Desktop. To further ensure a real life scenario, users were allowed to reject the proposed query and ask for a new one, if they considered it totally outside their interest areas. • One randomly selected log query, filtered using the same procedure as above. • One self-selected specific query, which they thought to have only one meaning. • One self-selected ambiguous query, which they thought to have at least three meanings. The average query lengths were 2.0 and 2.3 terms for the log queries, as well as 2.9 and 1.8 for the self-selected ones. Even though our algorithms are mainly intended to enhance search when using ambiguous query keywords, we chose to investigate their performance on a wide span of query types, in order to see how they perform in all situations. The log queries evaluate real life requests, in contrast to the self-selected ones, which target rather the identification of top and bottom performances. Note that the former ones were somewhat farther away from each subjects interest, thus being also more difficult to personalize on. To gain an insight into the relationship between each query type and user interests, we asked each person to rate the query itself with a score of 1 to 5, having the following interpretations: (1) never heard of it, (2) do not know it, but heard of it, (3) know it partially, (4) know it well, (5) major interest. The obtained grades were 3.11 for the top log queries, 3.72 for the randomly selected ones, 4.45 for the self-selected specific ones, and 4.39 for the self-selected ambiguous ones. For each query, we collected the Top-5 URLs generated by 20 versions of the algorithms4 presented in Section 3.1. These results were then shuffled into one set containing usually between 70 and 90 URLs. Thus, each subject had to assess about 325 documents for all four queries, being neither aware of the algorithm, nor of the ranking of each assessed URL. Overall, 72 queries were issued and over 6,000 URLs were evaluated during the experiment. For each of these URLs, the testers had to give a rating ranging from 0 to 2, dividing the relevant results in two categories, (1) relevant and (2) highly relevant. Finally, the quality of each ranking was assessed using the normalized version of Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) [15]. DCG is a rich measure, as it gives more weight to highly ranked documents, while also incorporating different relevance levels by giving them different gain values: DCG(i) = & G(1) , if i = 1 DCG(i − 1) + G(i)/log(i) , otherwise. We used G(i) = 1 for relevant results, and G(i) = 2 for highly relevant ones. As queries having more relevant output documents will have a higher DCG, we also normalized its value to a score between 0 (the worst possible DCG given the ratings) and 1 (the best possible DCG given the ratings) to facilitate averaging over queries. All results were tested for statistical significance using T-tests. 4 Note that all Desktop level parts of our algorithms were performed with Lucene using its predefined searching and ranking functions. Algorithmic specific aspects. The main parameter of our algorithms is the number of generated expansion keywords. For this experiment we set it to 4 terms for all techniques, leaving an analysis at this level for a subsequent investigation. In order to optimize the run-time computation speed, we chose to limit the number of output keywords per Desktop document to the number of expansion keywords desired (i.e., four). For all algorithms we also investigated bigger limitations. This allowed us to observe that the Lexical Compounds method would perform better if only at most one compound per document were selected. We therefore chose to experiment with this new approach as well. For all other techniques, considering less than four terms per document did not seem to consistently yield any additional qualitative gain. We labeled the algorithms we evaluated as follows: 0. Google: The actual Google query output, as returned by the Google API; 1. TF, DF: Term and Document Frequency; 2. LC, LC[O]: Regular and Optimized (by considering only one top compound per document) Lexical Compounds; 3. SS: Sentence Selection; 4. TC[CS], TC[MI], TC[LR]: Term Co-occurrence Statistics using respectively Cosine Similarity, Mutual Information, and Likelihood Ratio as similarity coefficients; 5. WN[SYN], WN[SUB], WN[SUP]: WordNet based expansion with synonyms, sub-concepts, and super-concepts, respectively. Except for the thesaurus based expansion, in all cases we also investigated the performance of our algorithms when exploiting only the Web browser cache to represent users personal information. This is motivated by the fact that other personal documents such as for example emails are known to have a somewhat different language than that residing on the world wide Web [34]. However, as this approach performed visibly poorer than using the entire Desktop data, we omitted it from the subsequent analysis. 3.2.2 Results Log Queries. We evaluated all variants of our algorithms using NDCG. For log queries, the best performance was achieved with TF, LC[O], and TC[LR]. The improvements they brought were up to 5.2% for top queries (p = 0.14) and 13.8% for randomly selected queries (p = 0.01, statistically significant), both obtained with LC[O]. A summary of all results is depicted in Table 1. Both TF and LC[O] yielded very good results, indicating that simple keyword and expression oriented approaches might be sufficient for the Desktop based query expansion task. LC[O] was much better than LC, ameliorating its quality with up to 25.8% in the case of randomly selected log queries, improvement which was also significant with p = 0.04. Thus, a selection of compounds spanning over several Desktop documents is more informative about users interests than the general approach, in which there is no restriction on the number of compounds produced from every personal item. The more complex Desktop oriented approaches, namely sentence selection and all term co-occurrence based algorithms, showed a rather average performance, with no visible improvements, except for TC[LR]. Also, the thesaurus based expansion usually produced very few suggestions, possibly because of the many technical queries employed by our subjects. We observed however that expanding with sub-concepts is very good for everyday life terms (e.g., car), whereas the use of super-concepts is valuable for compounds having at least one term with low technicality (e.g., document clustering). As expected, the synonym based expansion performed generally well, though in some very Algorithm NDCG Signific. NDCG Signific.

Finally, we noticed Google to be very optimized for some top frequent queries. However, even within this harder scenario, some of our personalization algorithms produced statistically significant improvements over regular search (i.e., TF and LC[O]). Self-selected Queries. The NDCG values obtained with selfselected queries are depicted in Table 2. While our algorithms did not enhance Google for the clear search tasks, they did produce strong improvements of up to 52.9% (which were of course also highly significant with p 0.01) when utilized with ambiguous queries. In fact, almost all our algorithms resulted in statistically significant improvements over Google for this query type. In general, the relative differences between our algorithms were similar to those observed for the log based queries. As in the previous analysis, the simple Desktop based Term Frequency and Lexical Compounds metrics performed best. Nevertheless, a very good outcome was also obtained for Desktop based sentence selection and all term co-occurrence metrics. There were no visible differences between the behavior of the three different approaches to cooccurrence calculation. Finally, for the case of clear queries, we noticed that fewer expansion terms than 4 might be less noisy and thus helpful in bringing further improvements. We thus pursued this idea with the adaptive algorithms presented in the next section. 4. INTRODUCING ADAPTIVITY In the previous section we have investigated the behavior of each technique when adding a fixed number of keywords to the user query. However, an optimal personalized query expansion algorithm should automatically adapt itself to various aspects of each query, as well as to the particularities of the person using it. In this section we discuss the factors influencing the behavior of our expansion algorithms, which might be used as input for the adaptivity process. Then, in the second part we present some initial experiments with one of them, namely query clarity. 4.1 Adaptivity Factors Several indicators could assist the algorithm to automatically tune the number of expansion terms. We start by discussing adaptation by analyzing the query clarity level. Then, we briefly introduce an approach to model the generic query formulation process in order to tailor the search algorithm automatically, and discuss some other possible factors that might be of use for this task. Query Clarity. The interest for analyzing query difficulty has increased only recently, and there are not many papers addressing this topic. Yet it has been long known that query disambiguation has a high potential of improving retrieval effectiveness for low recall searches with very short queries [20], which is exactly our targeted scenario. Also, the success of IR systems clearly varies across different topics. We thus propose to use an estimate number expressing the calculated level of query clarity in order to automatically tweak the amount of personalization fed into the algorithm. The following metrics are available: • The Query Length is expressed simply by the number of words in the user query. The solution is rather inefficient, as reported by He and Ounis [14]. • The Query Scope relates to the IDF of the entire query, as in: C1 = log( #DocumentsInCollection #Hits(Query) ) (7) This metric performs well when used with document collections covering a single topic, but poor otherwise [7, 14]. • The Query Clarity [7] seems to be the best, as well as the most applied technique so far. It measures the divergence between the language model associated to the user query and the language model associated to the collection. In a simplified version (i.e., without smoothing over the terms which are not present in the query), it can be expressed as follows: C2 =  w∈Query Pml(w|Query) · log Pml(w|Query) Pcoll(w) (8) where Pml(w|Query) is the probability of the word w within the submitted query, and Pcoll(w) is the probability of w within the entire collection of documents. Other solutions exist, but we think they are too computationally expensive for the huge amount of data that needs to be processed within Web applications. We thus decided to investigate only C1 and C2. First, we analyzed their performance over a large set of queries and split their clarity predictions in three categories: • Small Scope / Clear Query: C1 ∈ [0, 12], C2 ∈ [4, ∞). • Medium Scope / Semi-Ambiguous Query: C1 ∈ [12, 17), C2 ∈ [2.5, 4). • Large Scope / Ambiguous Query: C1 ∈ [17, ∞), C2 ∈ [0, 2.5]. In order to limit the amount of experiments, we analyzed only the results produced when employing C1 for the PIR and C2 for the Web. As algorithmic basis we used LC[O], i.e., optimized lexical compounds, which was clearly the winning method in the previous analysis. As manual investigation showed it to slightly overfit the expansion terms for clear queries, we utilized a substitute for this particular case. Two candidates were considered: (1) TF, i.e., the second best approach, and (2) WN[SYN], as we observed that its first and second expansion terms were often very good. Desktop Scope Web Clarity No. of Terms Algorithm Large Ambiguous 4 LC[O] Large Semi-Ambig. 3 LC[O] Large Clear 2 LC[O] Medium Ambiguous 3 LC[O] Medium Semi-Ambig. 2 LC[O] Medium Clear 1 TF / WN[SYN] Small Ambiguous 2 TF / WN[SYN] Small Semi-Ambig. 1 TF / WN[SYN] Small Clear 0Table 3: Adaptive Personalized Query Expansion. Given the algorithms and clarity measures, we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query, as a function of its ambiguity in the Web, as well as within users PIR. Note that the ambiguity level is related to the number of documents covering a certain query. Thus, to some extent, it has different meanings on the Web and within PIRs. While a query deemed ambiguous on a large collection such as the Web will very likely indeed have a large number of meanings, this may not be the case for the Desktop. Take for example the query PageRank. If the user is a link analysis expert, many of her documents might match this term, and thus the query would be classified as ambiguous. However, when analyzed against the Web, this is definitely a clear query. Consequently, we employed more additional terms, when the query was more ambiguous in the Web, but also on the Desktop. Put another way, queries deemed clear on the Desktop were inherently not well covered within users PIR, and thus had fewer keywords appended to them. The number of expansion terms we utilized for each combination of scope and clarity levels is depicted in Table 3. Query Formulation Process. Interactive query expansion has a high potential for enhancing search [29]. We believe that modeling its underlying process would be very helpful in producing qualitative adaptive Web search algorithms. For example, when the user is adding a new term to her previously issued query, she is basically reformulating her original request. Thus, the newly added terms are more likely to convey information about her search goals. For a general, non personalized retrieval engine, this could correspond to giving more weight to these new keywords. Within our personalized scenario, the generated expansions can similarly be biased towards these terms. Nevertheless, more investigations are necessary in order to solve the challenges posed by this approach. Other Features. The idea of adapting the retrieval process to various aspects of the query, of the user itself, and even of the employed algorithm has received only little attention in the literature. Only some approaches have been investigated, usually indirectly. There exist studies of query behaviors at different times of day, or of the topics spanned by the queries of various classes of users, etc. However, they generally do not discuss how these features can be actually incorporated in the search process itself and they have almost never been related to the task of Web personalization. 4.2 Experiments We used exactly the same experimental setup as for our previous analysis, with two log-based queries and two self-selected ones (all different from before, in order to make sure there is no bias on the new approaches), evaluated with NDCG over the Top-5 results output by each algorithm. The newly proposed adaptive personalized query expansion algorithms are denoted as A[LCO/TF] for the approach using TF with the clear Desktop queries, and as A[LCO/WN] when WN[SYN] was utilized instead of TF. The overall results were at least similar, or better than Google for all kinds of log queries (see Table 4). For top frequent queries, Algorithm NDCG Signific. NDCG Signific. Top vs. Google Random vs. Google Google 0.51 - 0.45TF 0.51 - 0.48 p = 0.04 LC[O] 0.53 p = 0.09 0.52 p < 0.01 WN[SYN] 0.51 - 0.45A[LCO/TF] 0.56 p < 0.01 0.49 p = 0.04 A[LCO/WN] 0.55 p = 0.01 0.44Table 4: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at the first 5 results when using our adaptive personalized search algorithms on top (left) and random (right) log queries. Algorithm NDCG Signific. NDCG Signific. Clear vs. Google Ambiguous vs. Google Google 0.81 - 0.46TF 0.76 - 0.54 p = 0.03 LC[O] 0.77 - 0.59 p 0.01 WN[SYN] 0.79 - 0.44A[LCO/TF] 0.81 - 0.64 p 0.01 A[LCO/WN] 0.81 - 0.63 p 0.01 Table 5: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at the first 5 results when using our adaptive personalized search algorithms on user selected clear (left) and ambiguous (right) queries. both adaptive algorithms, A[LCO/TF] and A[LCO/WN], improve with 10.8% and 7.9% respectively, both differences being also statistically significant with p ≤ 0.01. They also achieve an improvement of up to 6.62% over the best performing static algorithm, LC[O] (p = 0.07). For randomly selected queries, even though A[LCO/TF] yields significantly better results than Google (p = 0.04), both adaptive approaches fall behind the static algorithms. The major reason seems to be the imperfect selection of the number of expansion terms, as a function of query clarity. Thus, more experiments are needed in order to determine the optimal number of generated expansion keywords, as a function of the query ambiguity level. The analysis of the self-selected queries shows that adaptivity can bring even further improvements into Web search personalization (see Table 5). For ambiguous queries, the scores given to Google search are enhanced by 40.6% through A[LCO/TF] and by 35.2% through A[LCO/WN], both strongly significant with p 0.01. Adaptivity also brings another 8.9% improvement over the static personalization of LC[O] (p = 0.05). Even for clear queries, the newly proposed flexible algorithms perform slightly better, improving with 0.4% and 1.0% respectively. All results are depicted graphically in Figure 1. We notice that A[LCO/TF] is the overall best algorithm, performing better than Google for all types of queries, either extracted from the search engine log, or self-selected. The experiments presented in this section confirm clearly that adaptivity is a necessary further step to take in Web search personalization. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK In this paper we proposed to expand Web search queries by exploiting the users Personal Information Repository in order to automatically extract additional keywords related both to the query itself and to users interests, personalizing the search output. In this context, the paper includes the following contributions: • We proposed five techniques for determining expansion terms from personal documents. Each of them produces additional query keywords by analyzing users Desktop at increasing granularity levels, ranging from term and expression level analysis up to global co-occurrence statistics and external thesauri. Figure 1: Relative NDCG gain (in %) for each algorithm overall, as well as separated per query category. • We provided a thorough empirical analysis of several variants of our approaches, under four different scenarios. We showed some of these approaches to perform very well, producing NDCG improvements of up to 51.28%. • We moved this personalized search framework further and proposed to make the expansion process adaptive to features of each query, a strong focus being put on its clarity level. • Within a separate set of experiments, we showed our adaptive algorithms to provide an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best approach. We are currently performing investigations on the dependency between various query features and the optimal number of expansion terms. We are also analyzing other types of approaches to identify query expansion suggestions, such as applying Latent Semantic Analysis on the Desktop data. Finally, we are designing a set of more complex combinations of these metrics in order to provide enhanced adaptivity to our algorithms. 6.

En este documento, proponemos mejorar tales consultas web expandiéndolas con los términos recopilados del repositorio de información personal de cada usuarios, personalizando por lo tanto implícitamente la salida de búsqueda. Introducimos cinco técnicas amplias para generar las palabras clave de consulta adicionales mediante el análisis de los datos del usuario al aumento de los niveles de granularidad, que van desde el análisis a nivel de término y compuesto hasta las estadísticas de concurrencia global, así como hasta el uso de dicios de vía externas. Nuestro extenso análisis empírico en cuatro escenarios diferentes muestra algunos de estos enfoques para funcionar muy bien, especialmente en consultas ambiguas, produciendo un aumento muy fuerte en la calidad de las clasificaciones de salida. Posteriormente, movemos este marco de búsqueda personalizado un paso más allá y proponemos que el proceso de expansión sea adaptable a varias características de cada consulta. Un conjunto separado de experimentos indica los algoritmos adaptativos para brindar una mejora estadísticamente significativa adicional sobre el mejor enfoque de expansión estática.

Introducción La popularidad en auge de los motores de búsqueda ha determinado la búsqueda simple de palabras clave para convertirse en la única interfaz de usuario ampliamente aceptada para buscar información en la web. Sin embargo, las consultas de palabras clave son inherentemente ambiguas. El libro de consulta Canon, por ejemplo, cubre varias áreas diferentes de interés: religión, fotografía, literatura y música. Claramente, uno preferiría que la salida de búsqueda se alinee con los temas de interés de los usuarios, en lugar de mostrar una selección de URL populares de cada categoría. Los estudios han demostrado que más del 80% de los usuarios preferirían recibir tales resultados de búsqueda personalizados [33] en lugar de los actualmente genéricos. La expansión de la consulta ayuda al usuario a formular una mejor consulta, al agregar palabras clave adicionales a la solicitud de búsqueda inicial para encapsular sus intereses allí, así como para enfocar la salida de búsqueda web en consecuencia. Se ha demostrado que funciona muy bien en grandes conjuntos de datos, especialmente con consultas de entrada cortas (ver, por ejemplo, [19, 3]). ¡Este es exactamente el escenario de búsqueda web! En este documento, proponemos mejorar la reformulación de consultas web explotando el repositorio de información personal de los usuarios (PIR), es decir, la colección personal de documentos de texto, correos electrónicos, páginas web en caché, etc. Surgen varias ventajas al mover la personalización de la búsqueda web hasta el nivel de escritorio (tenga en cuenta que por escritorio nos referimos a PIR, y usamos los dos términos indistintamente). Primero es, por supuesto, la calidad de la personalización: el escritorio local es un rico repositorio de información, que describe con precisión la mayoría, si no todos los intereses del usuario. En segundo lugar, como toda la información del perfil se almacena y explota localmente, en la máquina personal, otro beneficio muy importante es la privacidad. Los motores de búsqueda no deben poder conocer los intereses de una persona, es decir, no deberían poder conectar a una persona específica con las consultas que emitió, o peor, con las URL de salida que hizo clic dentro de la interfaz de búsqueda1 (ver Volokh [35]para una discusión sobre cuestiones de privacidad relacionadas con la búsqueda web personalizada). Nuestros algoritmos expanden consultas web con palabras clave extraídas de los usuarios PIR, personalizando implícitamente la salida de búsqueda. Después de una discusión de los trabajos anteriores en la Sección 2, primero investigamos el análisis del contexto de consulta de escritorio local en la Sección 3.1.1. Proponemos varias técnicas de palabras clave, expresión y resumen para determinar los términos de expansión de aquellos documentos personales que coinciden mejor con la consulta web. En la Sección 3.1.2 movemos nuestro análisis a la colección de escritorio global e investigamos expansiones basadas en métricas de concurrencia y dicios externos. Los experimentos presentados en la Sección 3.2 muestran muchos de estos enfoques para funcionar muy bien, especialmente en consultas ambiguas, produciendo mejoras de NDCG [15] de hasta 51.28%. En la Sección 4, movemos este marco algorítmico aún más y proponemos que el proceso de expansión sea adaptable al nivel de claridad de la consulta. Esto produce una mejora adicional de 8.47% sobre el mejor algoritmo previamente identificado. Concluimos y discutimos más trabajo en la Sección 5. 1 Los motores de búsqueda pueden mapear consultas al menos a las direcciones IP, por ejemplo, utilizando cookies y minando los registros de consultas. Sin embargo, al mover el perfil de usuario a nivel de escritorio, nos aseguramos de que dicha información no esté explícitamente asociada a un usuario en particular y se almacene en el lado del motor de búsqueda.2. Trabajo anterior Este documento reúne dos áreas IR: personalización de búsqueda y expansión automática de consultas. Existe una gran cantidad de algoritmos para ambos dominios. Sin embargo, no se ha hecho mucho específicamente dirigido a combinarlos. Por lo tanto, en esta sección presentamos un análisis separado, primero introducimos algunos enfoques para personalizar la búsqueda, ya que este representa el objetivo principal de nuestra investigación, y luego discutiendo varias técnicas de expansión de consultas y su relación con nuestros algoritmos.2.1 Búsqueda personalizada La búsqueda personalizada comprende dos componentes principales: (1) Perfiles de usuario y (2) el algoritmo de búsqueda real. Esta sección divide los antecedentes relevantes de acuerdo con el enfoque de cada artículo en cualquiera de estos elementos. Enfoques centrados en el perfil de usuario. Sugiyama et al.[32] analizó el comportamiento de surf y generó perfiles de usuario como características (términos) de las páginas visitadas. Al emitir una nueva consulta, los resultados de búsqueda se clasificaron en función de la similitud entre cada URL y el perfil de usuario. Qiu y Cho [26] utilizaron el aprendizaje automático en el historial de clics pasado del usuario para determinar los vectores de preferencia de tema y luego aplicar PageRank sensible al tema [13]. El perfil de usuario basado en el historial de navegación tiene la ventaja de ser bastante fácil de obtener y procesar. Esta es probablemente la razón por la que también es empleado por varios motores de búsqueda industrial (por ejemplo, Yahoo! Myweb2). Sin embargo, definitivamente no es suficiente para reunir una visión exhaustiva de los intereses de los usuarios. Más, requiere almacenar toda la información personal en el lado del servidor, lo que plantea importantes problemas de privacidad. Solo otros dos enfoques mejoraron la búsqueda web utilizando datos de escritorio, pero ambos usaron diferentes ideas centrales: (1) Teevan et al.[34] modificó los pesos del término de consulta del esquema de ponderación BM25 para incorporar los intereses de los usuarios como capturados por sus índices de escritorio;(2) En Chirita et al.[6], nos centramos en volver a clasificar la salida de búsqueda web de acuerdo con la distancia coseno entre cada URL y un conjunto de términos de escritorio que describen los intereses de los usuarios. Además, ninguno de estos investigó la aplicación adaptativa de la personalización. Enfoques centrados en el algoritmo de personalización. Construir efectivamente el aspecto de personalización directamente en PageRank [25] (es decir, sesgarlo en un conjunto objetivo de páginas) ha recibido mucha atención recientemente. Haveliwala [13] calculó un PageRank atacado, en el que 16 vectores de PageRank sesgados en cada uno de los temas principales del directorio abierto se calcularon inicialmente fuera de línea, y luego se combinaron en el tiempo de ejecución en función de la similitud entre la consulta del usuario y cada uno de los de cada uno de los de cada uno deLos 16 temas. Más recientemente, Nie et al.[24] modificó la idea distribuyendo el PageRank de una página en los temas que contiene para generar clasificaciones orientadas a temas. JEH y Widom [16] propusieron un algoritmo que evita los recursos masivos necesarios para almacenar un Vector PageRank personalizado (PPV) por usuario mediante la precomputación de PPV solo para un pequeño conjunto de páginas y luego aplicar combinación lineal. Como el cálculo de los PPV para conjuntos de páginas más grandes aún era bastante costoso, se han investigado varias soluciones, las más importantes son las de Fogaras y Racz [12], y Sarlos et al.[30], este último usando redondeo y boceto de minuto de recuento para obtener rápidamente las aproximaciones precisas de las puntuaciones personalizadas.2.2 Expansión de consulta automática La expansión de consulta automática tiene como objetivo derivar una mejor formulación de la consulta de usuario para mejorar la recuperación. Se basa en explotar varias características sociales o específicas de la colección para generar términos adicionales, que se adjuntan al IN2 http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com. En esta sección, encuestamos algunos de los trabajos de expansión de consultas representativas agrupados de acuerdo con la fuente empleada para generar términos adicionales: (1) Comentarios de relevancia, (2) estadísticas de co-ocurrencia basadas en la recopilación y (3) información del teso. Algunos otros enfoques también se abordan al final de la sección. Técnicas de retroalimentación de relevancia. La idea principal de retroalimentación de relevancia (RF) es que se puede extraer información útil de los documentos relevantes devueltos para la consulta inicial. Los primeros enfoques fueron manuales [28] en el sentido de que el usuario era el que eligió los resultados relevantes, y luego se aplicaron varios métodos para extraer nuevos términos, relacionados con la consulta y los documentos seleccionados. Efthimiadis [11] presentó una revisión integral de la literatura y propuso varios métodos simples para extraer tales palabras clave nuevas basadas en la frecuencia del término, la frecuencia de los documentos, etc. Utilizamos algunos de estos como inspiración para nuestras técnicas específicas de escritorio. Chang y HSU [5] pidieron a los usuarios que elijan grupos relevantes, en lugar de documentos, reduciendo así la cantidad de interacción necesaria. También se ha demostrado que RF se automatizan efectivamente considerando los documentos mejor clasificados como relevantes [37] (esto se conoce como pseudo RF). Lam y Jones [21] utilizaron el resumen para extraer oraciones informativas de los documentos mejor clasificados y las agregaron a la consulta del usuario. Carpineto et al.[4] maximizó la divergencia entre el modelo de idioma definido por los documentos recuperados superiores y el definido por toda la colección. Finalmente, Yu et al.[38] seleccionó los términos de expansión de segmentos de páginas web basados en la visión para hacer frente a los múltiples temas que residen en él. Técnicas basadas en concurrencia. Se ha demostrado que los términos altamente concurrentes con las palabras clave emitidas aumentan la precisión cuando se agrega a la consulta [17]. Se han desarrollado muchas medidas estadísticas para evaluar mejor los niveles de relación de términos, ya sea analizando documentos completos [27], relaciones de afinidad léxica [3] (es decir, pares de palabras estrechamente relacionadas que contienen exactamente uno de los términos de consulta iniciales), etc. También hemos investigado tres enfoques de este tipo para identificar palabras clave relevantes de consulta del repositorio de información personal rico pero bastante complejo. Técnicas basadas en el tesauro. Un método ampliamente explorado es expandir la consulta del usuario con nuevos términos, cuyo significado está estrechamente relacionado con las palabras clave de entrada. Dichas relaciones generalmente se extraen de los dicios de sinónimos a gran escala, como WordNet [23], en los que se predefinen varios conjuntos de sinónimos, hipernyms, etc. Al igual que para los métodos de concurrencia, los experimentos iniciales con este enfoque fueron controvertidos, ya sea mejoras de informes o incluso reducciones en la calidad de la producción [36]. Recientemente, a medida que las colecciones experimentales se hicieron más grandes, y a medida que los algoritmos empleados se volvieron más complejos, se han obtenido mejores resultados [31, 18, 22]. También usamos términos de expansión basados en WordNet. Sin embargo, basamos este proceso en analizar la relación de nivel de escritorio entre la consulta original y las nuevas palabras clave propuestas. Otras técnicas. Hay muchos otros intentos de extraer términos de expansión. Aunque ortogonal a nuestro enfoque, dos obras son muy relevantes para el entorno web: Cui et al.[8] generaron correlaciones de palabras que utilizan la probabilidad de que los términos de consulta aparezcan en cada documento, según lo calculado en los registros del motor de búsqueda. Kraft y Zien [19] mostraron que el texto de anclaje es muy similar a las consultas de los usuarios y, por lo tanto, lo explotó para adquirir palabras clave adicionales.3. La expansión de la consulta utilizando datos de escritorio de escritorio representa un repositorio muy rico de información de perfiles. Sin embargo, esta información viene de una manera muy no estructurada, que cubre documentos que son muy diversos en formato, contenido e incluso características del lenguaje. En esta sección, primero abordamos este problema proponiendo varios algoritmos de análisis léxico que explotan a los usuarios PIR para extraer términos de expansión de palabras clave en diversas granularidades, que van desde la frecuencia de término dentro de los documentos de escritorio hasta la utilización de estadísticas de concurrencia global sobre el repositorio de información personal. Luego, en la segunda parte de la sección analizamos empíricamente el rendimiento de cada enfoque.3.1 Algoritmos Esta sección presenta los cinco enfoques genéricos para analizar los datos de escritorio de los usuarios para proporcionar términos de expansión para la búsqueda web. En los algoritmos propuestos aumentamos gradualmente la cantidad de información personal utilizada. Por lo tanto, en la primera parte investigamos tres técnicas de análisis locales centradas solo en aquellos documentos de escritorio que coinciden con la consulta de los usuarios. Agradecemos a la consulta web los términos, compuestos y resúmenes de oraciones más relevantes de estos documentos. En la segunda parte de la sección avanzamos hacia un análisis global de escritorio, proponiendo investigar las concurrencias de términos, así como los tesauros, en el proceso de expansión.3.1.1 Expansión con el análisis local de escritorio de escritorio El análisis de escritorio local está relacionado con la mejora de la retroalimentación de pseudo relevancia para generar palabras clave de expansión de consulta de los mejores éxitos para la consulta web de los usuarios, en lugar de los resultados de búsqueda web mejor clasificados. Distinguemos tres niveles de granularidad para este proceso e investigamos cada uno de ellos por separado. Término y frecuencia de documentos. Como las medidas más simples posibles, TF y DF tienen la ventaja de ser muy rápido para calcular. Experimentos anteriores con pequeños conjuntos de datos han demostrado que producen muy buenos resultados [11]. Por lo tanto, asociamos de forma independiente una puntuación con cada término, basado en cada una de las dos estadísticas. El basado en TF se obtiene multiplicando la frecuencia real de un término con un puntaje de posición descendente ya que el término aparece primero más cerca del final del documento. Esto es necesario, especialmente para documentos más largos, porque los términos más informativos tienden a aparecer hacia su comienzo [10]. La fórmula completa de extracción de palabras clave basada en TF es la siguiente: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · Nrwords - Pos Nrwords!· Log (1 + tf) (1) donde NRWords es el número total de términos en el documento y POS es la posición de la primera aparición del término;TF representa la frecuencia de cada término en el documento de escritorio que coincide con la consulta web de los usuarios. La identificación de términos de expansión adecuados es aún más simple cuando se usa DF: dado el conjunto de documentos de escritorio relevantes de Top-K, genere sus fragmentos enfocados en la solicitud de búsqueda original. Esta orientación de consulta es necesaria, ya que los puntajes DF se calculan a nivel de todo el PIR y de lo contrario producirían sugerencias demasiado ruidosas. Una vez que se ha identificado el conjunto de términos candidatos, la selección se realiza ordenándoles de acuerdo con los puntajes de DF con los que están asociados. Los lazos se resuelven utilizando los puntajes de TF correspondientes. Tenga en cuenta que un enfoque HFXIDF híbrido no es necesariamente eficiente, ya que un término de escritorio podría tener un DF alto en el escritorio, mientras que es bastante raro en la web. Por ejemplo, el término PageRank sería bastante frecuente en el escritorio de un científico IR, logrando así una puntuación baja con TFXIDF. Sin embargo, como es bastante raro en la web, sería una buena resolución de la consulta hacia el tema correcto. Compuestos léxicos. Anick y Tipirneni [2] definieron la hipótesis de dispersión léxica, según la cual una expresión de dispersión léxica (es decir, el número de compuestos diferentes en los que aparece dentro de un documento o grupo de documentos) puede usarse automáticamente conceptos clave sobre el documento de entrada sobre el documento de entradacolocar. Aunque hay varias expresiones compuestas posibles disponibles, se ha demostrado que los enfoques simples basados en el análisis de sustantivos son casi tan buenos como los algoritmos de identificación de patrones de voz altamente complejos [1]. Por lo tanto, inspeccionamos los documentos de escritorio coincidentes para todos sus compuestos léxicos de la siguiente forma: {¿Adjetivo?sustantivo+} Todos estos compuestos podrían generarse fácilmente fuera de línea, en el momento de la indexación, para todos los documentos en el repositorio local. Además, una vez identificados, se pueden clasificar más dependiendo de su dispersión dentro de cada documento para facilitar la recuperación rápida de los compuestos más frecuentes en el tiempo de ejecución. Selección de oraciones. Esta técnica se basa en el resumen de documentos orientados a las oraciones: primero, se identifica el conjunto de documentos de escritorio relevantes;Luego, un resumen que contiene sus oraciones más importantes se genera como salida. La selección de oraciones es el enfoque de análisis local más completo, ya que produce las expansiones más detalladas (es decir, oraciones). Su desventaja es que, a diferencia de los dos primeros algoritmos, su salida no se puede almacenar de manera eficiente y, en consecuencia, no se puede calcular fuera de línea. Generamos resúmenes basados en oraciones clasificando las oraciones del documento de acuerdo con su puntaje de relevancia, de la siguiente manera [21]: Sentencescore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ El primer término es la relación entre la cantidad cuadrada de palabras significativas dentro de la oración y el totalnúmero de palabras en ellas. Una palabra es significativa en un documento si su frecuencia está por encima de un umbral de la siguiente manera: tf> ms = v `x 7 - 0.1 ∗ (25 - ns), si ns <25 7, si ns ∈ [25, 40] 7 +0.1 ∗ (NS - 40), si NS> 40 con NS es el número total de oraciones en el documento (ver [21] para más detalles). El segundo término es una puntuación de posición establecida en (AVG (NS) - SentenceIndex)/AVG2 (NS) para las primeras diez oraciones, y a 0 de lo contrario, AVG (NS) es el número promedio de oraciones sobre todos los elementos de escritorio. De esta manera, los documentos breves como los correos electrónicos no se ven afectados, lo cual es correcto, ya que generalmente no contienen un resumen al principio. Sin embargo, como los documentos más largos generalmente incluyen oraciones descriptivas generales al principio [10], es más probable que estas oraciones sean relevantes. El término final sesga el resumen hacia la consulta. Es la relación entre el número cuadrado de términos de consulta presentes en la oración y el número total de términos de la consulta. Se basa en la creencia de que cuantos más términos de consulta contenidos en una oración, más probable es que esa oración transmitiera información altamente relacionada con la consulta.3.1.2 Expansión con el análisis global de escritorio en contraste con el enfoque presentado anteriormente, el análisis global se basa en información de todo el escritorio personal para inferir los nuevos términos de consulta relevantes. En esta sección proponemos dos de estas técnicas, a saber, estadísticas de coincidencia de término, y filtrando la salida de un tesauro externo. Estadísticas de coincidencia de término. Para cada término, podemos calcular fácilmente fuera de línea aquellos términos que concurren con él con mayor frecuencia en una colección dada (es decir, PIR en nuestro caso), y luego explotar esta información en el tiempo de ejecución para inferir palabras clave altamente correlacionadas conla consulta de usuario. Nuestro algoritmo genérico de expansión de consultas basado en la concurrencia es el siguiente: Algoritmo 3.1.2.1. Seguimiento de similitud de palabras clave basada en concurrencia. Computación fuera de línea: 1: Filtro de palabras clave potenciales k con df ∈ [10 ,..., 20% · n] 2: para cada palabra clave Ki 3: para cada palabra clave KJ 4: Compute scki, kj, el coeficiente de similitud de (ki, kj) cálculo en línea: 1: Sea s el conjunto de palabras clave, potencialmenteSimilar a una expresión de entrada E. 2: para cada palabra clave K de E: 3: S ← S ∪ TSC (k), donde TSC (k) contiene los términos más importantes de K más similares a K 4: para cada término T de S: 5A: Sea la puntuación (t) ← Q k∈E (0.01 + sct, k) 5b: STORT (T) ← #DesktoPhits (E | T) 6: Seleccione los términos Top-K de S con los puntajes más altos. El cálculo fuera de línea necesita una fase de recorte inicial (paso 1) para fines de optimización. Además, también restringimos el algoritmo para calcular los niveles de concurrencia solo entre los sustantivos, ya que contienen con mucho la mayor cantidad de información conceptual, y a medida que este enfoque reduce considerablemente el tamaño de la matriz de concurrencia. Durante la fase de tiempo de ejecución, con los términos más correlacionados con cada palabra clave de consulta en particular ya identificada, es necesaria una operación más, es decir, calcular la correlación de cada término de salida con toda la consulta. Son posibles dos enfoques: (1) utilizando un producto de la correlación entre el término y todas las palabras clave en la expresión original (paso 5a), o (2) simplemente contando el número de documentos en los que el término propuesto coopera con todaConsulta de usuario (Paso 5B). Consideramos las siguientes fórmulas para los coeficientes de similitud [17]: • La similitud cosena, definida como: cs = dfx, y pdfx · dfy (2) • información mutua, definida como: mi = log n · dfx, y dfx · dfy (3 (3) • Ratio de probabilidad, definida en los párrafos a continuación. DFX es la frecuencia de documento del término X y DFX, y es el número de documentos que contienen X e Y. Para aumentar aún más la calidad de las puntuaciones generadas, limitamos el último indicador a las coincidencias dentro de una ventana de los términos W. Establecemos W como lo mismo que la cantidad máxima de palabras clave de expansión deseadas. La relación de probabilidad de Dunnings λ [9] es una métrica basada en la concurrencia similar a χ2. Comienza intentando rechazar la hipótesis nula, según la cual dos términos A y B aparecerían en texto independientemente el uno del otro. Esto significa que p (a b) = p (a¬b) = p (a), donde p (a-b) es la probabilidad de que el término a no sea seguido por el término B. en consecuencia, la prueba de independencia de A y Bse puede realizar mirando si la distribución de un dado que B está presente es la misma que la distribución de un dado que B no está presente. Por supuesto, en realidad sabemos que estos términos no son independientes en el texto, y solo usamos las métricas estadísticas para resaltar los términos que aparecen con frecuencia juntos. Comparamos los dos procesos binomiales utilizando las relaciones de probabilidad de sus hipótesis asociadas. Primero, definamos la relación de probabilidad para una hipótesis: λ = maxω∈ω0 H (Ω; k) maxω∈ω H (Ω; k) (4) donde Ω es un punto en el espacio de parámetros ω, ω0 es el particularLa hipótesis que se está probando, y K es un punto en el espacio de observaciones K. Si suponemos que dos distribuciones binomiales tienen el mismo parámetro subyacente, es decir, {(p1, p2) |p1 = p2}, podemos escribir: λ = maxp h (p, p; k1, k2, n1, n2) maxp1, p2 h (p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) (5) donde h (p1 (p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) = pk1 1 · (1 - p1) (n1 - k1) · n1 k1 ¡· pk2 2 · (1 - p2) (n2 - k2) · n2 k2 ¡. Dado que los máximos se obtienen con p1 = k1 n1, p2 = k2 n2 y p = k1+k2 n1+n2, tenemos: λ = maxp l (p, k1, n1) l (p, k2, n2) maxp1,P2 L (P1, K1, N1) L (P2, K2, N2) (6) donde L (P, K, N) = Pk · (1 - P) N - K. Tomando el logaritmo de la probabilidad, obtenemos: −2 · log λ = 2 · [log l (p1, k1, n1) + log l (p2, k2, n2) - log l (p, k1, n1) - logL (P, K2, N2)] Donde log L (P, K, N) = K · log P + (N - K) · log (1 - p). Finalmente, si escribimos O11 = P (A B), O12 = P (¬A B), O21 = P (A ¬B) y O22 = P (¬A¬B), entonces la probabilidad de concurrencia de los términos A yB se convierte en: −2 · log λ = 2 · [o11 · log p1 + o12 · log (1 - p1) + o21 · log p2 + o22 · log (1 - p2) - (o11 + o21) · log p - ((O12+o22) · log (1 - p)] donde p1 = k1 n1 = o11 o11+o12, p2 = k2 n2 = o21 o21+o22, y p = k1+k2 n1+n2 expansión basada en el teso. Los tesauros a gran escala encapsulan el conocimiento global sobre las relaciones de términos. Por lo tanto, primero identificamos el conjunto de términos estrechamente relacionados con cada palabra clave de consulta, y luego calculamos el nivel de concurrencia de escritorio de cada uno de estos posibles términos de expansión con toda la solicitud de búsqueda inicial. Al final, se mantienen esas sugerencias con las frecuencias más altas. El algoritmo es el siguiente: Algoritmo 3.1.2.2. Expansión de consulta basada en el tesauro filtrado.1: para cada palabra clave k de una consulta de entrada Q: 2: Seleccione los siguientes conjuntos de términos relacionados usando WordNet: 2a: Syn: Todos los sinónimos 2B: Sub: Todos los subconceptos que residen en un nivel por debajo de K 2C: Super: Todos los super-conceptos que residen un nivel por encima de K 3: para cada conjunto SI de los conjuntos mencionados anteriormente: 4: para cada término t de Si: 5: Busque el PIR con (Q | T), es decir, la consulta original, como se expandió con T 6: Sea h el número de éxitos de la búsqueda anterior (es decir, el nivel de concurencia de t con Q) 7: devuelve los términos Top-K según lo ordenado por sus valores H. Observamos tres tipos de relaciones a términos (pasos 2a-2c): (1) sinónimos, (2) subconceptos, a saber, hiponomas (es decir, subclases) y mierymes (es decir, subpartes) y (3) Super-conceptos, a saber, hipernyms (es decir, súper clases) y holónimos (es decir, súper partes). Como representan tipos de asociación bastante diferentes, los investigamos por separado. Limitamos el conjunto de expansión de salida (Paso 7) para contener solo términos que aparecen al menos t veces en el escritorio, para evitar sugerencias ruidosas, con t = min (n docsepertópico, mindocs). Establecimos DocSpertopic = 2, 500 y Mindocs = 5, el último que está afrontando el caso de pequeños pirs.3.2 Experimentos 3.2.1 Configuración experimental Evaluamos nuestros algoritmos con 18 materias (Ph.D. y Postdoc. Estudiantes en diferentes áreas de informática y educación). Primero, instalaron nuestro motor de búsqueda basado en Lucene3 y 3 claramente, si uno ya hubiera instalado una aplicación de búsqueda de escritorio, entonces esta sobrecarga no estaría presente.indexado todo su contenido almacenado localmente: archivos dentro de rutas, correos electrónicos y caché web seleccionados por el usuario. Sin pérdida de generalidad, centramos los experimentos en máquinas de un solo usuario. Luego, eligieron 4 consultas relacionadas con sus actividades cotidianas, de la siguiente manera: • Una consulta de Altavista muy frecuente, como se extrae de las consultas más importantes del 2% más emitidas al motor de búsqueda dentro de un registro de 7.2 millones de entradas a partir de octubre de 2001. Para conectar dicha consulta a los intereses de cada usuarios, agregamos una fase de preprocesamiento fuera de línea: generamos las solicitudes de búsqueda más frecuentes y luego seleccionamos aleatoriamente una consulta con al menos 10 golpes en el escritorio de cada sujeto. Para garantizar aún más un escenario de la vida real, a los usuarios se les permitió rechazar la consulta propuesta y solicitar una nueva, si lo consideraban totalmente fuera de sus áreas de interés.• Una consulta de registro seleccionada al azar, filtrada utilizando el mismo procedimiento que anteriormente.• Una consulta específica autoseleccionada, que pensaron que solo tenía un significado.• Una consulta ambigua autoseleccionada, que pensaron que tenían al menos tres significados. Las longitudes de consulta promedio fueron de 2.0 y 2.3 términos para las consultas de registro, así como 2.9 y 1.8 para los autoseleccionados. A pesar de que nuestros algoritmos están destinados principalmente a mejorar la búsqueda cuando utilizan palabras clave de consulta ambigua, elegimos investigar su rendimiento en un amplio lapso de tipos de consultas, para ver cómo funcionan en todas las situaciones. Las consultas de registro evalúan las solicitudes de la vida real, en contraste con las auto-seleccionadas, que se dirigen a la identificación de actuaciones superior e inferior. Tenga en cuenta que los primeros estaban un poco más lejos del interés de cada sujeto, por lo que también fueron más difíciles de personalizar. Para obtener una visión de la relación entre cada tipo de consulta y los intereses de los usuarios, le pedimos a cada persona que califique la consulta en sí misma con un puntaje de 1 a 5, con las siguientes interpretaciones: (1) nunca ha oído hablar de ella, (2) noConozca, pero escuché de él, (3) lo sepan parcialmente, (4) lo sepan bien, (5) gran interés. Los grados obtenidos fueron 3.11 para las consultas de registro más importantes, 3.72 para las seleccionadas al azar, 4.45 para las específicas auto-seleccionadas y 4.39 para las ambiguas autoseleccionadas. Para cada consulta, recolectamos las 5 URL principales generadas por 20 versiones de los algoritmos4 presentados en la Sección 3.1. Estos resultados se arrastraron en un conjunto que generalmente contenía entre 70 y 90 URL. Por lo tanto, cada sujeto tuvo que evaluar unos 325 documentos para las cuatro consultas, ya que ni al tanto del algoritmo, ni de la clasificación de cada URL evaluada. En general, se emitieron 72 consultas y se evaluaron más de 6,000 URL durante el experimento. Para cada una de estas URL, los evaluadores tuvieron que dar una calificación de 0 a 2, dividiendo los resultados relevantes en dos categorías, (1) relevante y (2) altamente relevante. Finalmente, la calidad de cada clasificación se evaluó utilizando la versión normalizada de ganancia acumulativa con descuento (DCG) [15]. DCG es una medida rica, ya que da más peso a documentos altamente calificados, al tiempo que incorpora diferentes niveles de relevancia al darles diferentes valores de ganancia: DCG (i) = & g (1), si i = 1 DCG (i - 1)+ G (i)/log (i), de lo contrario. Usamos g (i) = 1 para resultados relevantes, y g (i) = 2 para los altamente relevantes. Como las consultas que tienen documentos de salida más relevantes tendrán un DCG más alto, también normalizamos su valor a un puntaje entre 0 (el peor DCG posible dadas las clasificaciones) y 1 (la mejor DCG posible dadas las calificaciones) para facilitar el promedio de las consultas. Todos los resultados fueron probados para determinar la significación estadística utilizando pruebas t.4 Tenga en cuenta que todas las partes de nivel de escritorio de nuestros algoritmos se realizaron con Lucene utilizando sus funciones de búsqueda y clasificación predefinidas. Aspectos específicos algorítmicos. El parámetro principal de nuestros algoritmos es el número de palabras clave de expansión generadas. Para este experimento, lo establecemos en 4 términos para todas las técnicas, dejando un análisis en este nivel para una investigación posterior. Para optimizar la velocidad de cálculo del tiempo de ejecución, elegimos limitar el número de palabras clave de salida por documento de escritorio al número de palabras clave de expansión deseadas (es decir, cuatro). Para todos los algoritmos también investigamos mayores limitaciones. Esto nos permitió observar que el método de compuestos léxicos funcionaría mejor si solo se seleccionara un compuesto por documento. Por lo tanto, elegimos experimentar con este nuevo enfoque también. Para todas las demás técnicas, considerar menos de cuatro términos por documento no parecía producir constantemente ninguna ganancia cualitativa adicional. Etiquetamos los algoritmos que evaluamos de la siguiente manera: 0. Google: La salida real de Google Consult, según lo devuelve la API de Google;1. TF, DF: frecuencia de término y documento;2. LC, LC [O]: regular y optimizado (considerando solo un compuesto superior por documento) compuestos léxicos;3. SS: selección de oraciones;4. TC [CS], TC [MI], TC [LR]: estadísticas de concurrencia de término utilizando similitudes de coseno respectivamente, información mutua y relación de probabilidad como coeficientes de similitud;5. Wn [Syn], Wn [Sub], Wn [Sup]: expansión basada en WordNet con sinónimos, subconceptos y superconceptos, respectivamente. A excepción de la expansión basada en el tesauro, en todos los casos también investigamos el rendimiento de nuestros algoritmos al explotar solo el caché del navegador web para representar la información personal de los usuarios. Esto está motivado por el hecho de que otros documentos personales, como por ejemplo, se sabe que los correos electrónicos tienen un lenguaje algo diferente al que reside en la World Wide Web [34]. Sin embargo, a medida que este enfoque funcionó visiblemente más pobre que el uso de los datos de escritorio completos, lo omitimos del análisis posterior.3.2.2 Consultas de registro de resultados. Evaluamos todas las variantes de nuestros algoritmos usando NDCG. Para las consultas de registro, el mejor rendimiento se logró con TF, LC [O] y TC [LR]. Las mejoras que trajeron fueron de hasta 5.2% para consultas superiores (P = 0.14) y 13.8% para consultas seleccionadas al azar (P = 0.01, estadísticamente significativas), ambas obtenidas con LC [O]. Un resumen de todos los resultados se muestra en la Tabla 1. Tanto TF como LC [O] arrojaron muy buenos resultados, lo que indica que los enfoques simples de palabras clave y orientados a la expresión podrían ser suficientes para la tarea de expansión de consultas basada en el escritorio. LC [O] fue mucho mejor que LC, mejorando su calidad con hasta el 25.8% en el caso de consultas log de registro seleccionadas al azar, mejoría que también fue significativa con p = 0.04. Por lo tanto, una selección de compuestos que abarcan varios documentos de escritorio es más informativa sobre los intereses de los usuarios que el enfoque general, en el que no hay restricción en el número de compuestos producidos a partir de cada elemento personal. Los enfoques orientados al escritorio más complejos, a saber, la selección de oraciones y los algoritmos basados en la concurrencia de todo el término, mostraron un rendimiento bastante promedio, sin mejoras visibles, excepto TC [LR]. Además, la expansión basada en el tesauro generalmente producía muy pocas sugerencias, posiblemente debido a las muchas consultas técnicas empleadas por nuestros sujetos. Sin embargo, observamos que expandirse con subconceptos es muy bueno para los términos de la vida cotidiana (por ejemplo, CAR), mientras que el uso de superconceptos es valioso para compuestos que tienen al menos un término con bajo tecnicismo (por ejemplo, agrupación de documentos). Como se esperaba, la expansión basada en el sinónimo funcionó generalmente bien, aunque en algunos algoritmo NDCG significativo. NDCG significado.

Finalmente, notamos que Google estaba muy optimizado para algunas consultas frecuentes superiores. Sin embargo, incluso dentro de este escenario más difícil, algunos de nuestros algoritmos de personalización produjeron mejoras estadísticamente significativas sobre la búsqueda regular (es decir, TF y LC [O]). Consultas autoseleccionadas. Los valores de NDCG obtenidos con consultas autoelectadas se representan en la Tabla 2. Si bien nuestros algoritmos no mejoraron Google para las tareas de búsqueda claras, produjeron fuertes mejoras de hasta 52.9% (que, por supuesto, también fueron muy significativas con P 0.01) cuando se utilizaron con consultas ambiguas. De hecho, casi todos nuestros algoritmos dieron como resultado mejoras estadísticamente significativas sobre Google para este tipo de consulta. En general, las diferencias relativas entre nuestros algoritmos fueron similares a las observadas para las consultas basadas en log. Como en el análisis anterior, la frecuencia de término basada en escritorio simple y las métricas de compuestos léxicos funcionaban mejor. Sin embargo, también se obtuvo un muy buen resultado para la selección de oraciones basada en el escritorio y métricas de concurrencia de todo el término. No hubo diferencias visibles entre el comportamiento de los tres enfoques diferentes para el cálculo de la coincurrencia. Finalmente, para el caso de consultas claras, notamos que menos términos de expansión que 4 podrían ser menos ruidosos y, por lo tanto, útiles para lograr mejoras adicionales. Por lo tanto, seguimos esta idea con los algoritmos adaptativos presentados en la siguiente sección.4. Introducción de la adaptación en la sección anterior Hemos investigado el comportamiento de cada técnica al agregar un número fijo de palabras clave a la consulta del usuario. Sin embargo, un algoritmo óptimo de expansión de consulta personalizada debe adaptarse automáticamente a varios aspectos de cada consulta, así como a las particularidades de la persona que lo usa. En esta sección discutimos los factores que influyen en el comportamiento de nuestros algoritmos de expansión, que podrían usarse como entrada para el proceso de adaptación. Luego, en la segunda parte presentamos algunos experimentos iniciales con uno de ellos, a saber, la claridad de consulta.4.1 Factores de adaptación Varios indicadores podrían ayudar al algoritmo a sintonizar automáticamente el número de términos de expansión. Comenzamos discutiendo la adaptación analizando el nivel de claridad de consulta. Luego, presentamos brevemente un enfoque para modelar el proceso de formulación de consultas genéricas para adaptar automáticamente el algoritmo de búsqueda y discutir algunos otros factores posibles que podrían ser útiles para esta tarea. Claridad de consulta. El interés por analizar la dificultad de consultas ha aumentado solo recientemente, y no hay muchos documentos que aborden este tema. Sin embargo, ha sabido hace mucho tiempo que la desambiguación de la consulta tiene un alto potencial de mejorar la efectividad de la recuperación para búsquedas de bajo retiro con consultas muy cortas [20], que es exactamente nuestro escenario específico. Además, el éxito de los sistemas IR claramente varía en diferentes temas. Por lo tanto, proponemos utilizar un número de estimación que exprese el nivel calculado de claridad de consulta para ajustar automáticamente la cantidad de personalización alimentada en el algoritmo. Las siguientes métricas están disponibles: • La longitud de la consulta se expresa simplemente por el número de palabras en la consulta del usuario. La solución es bastante ineficiente, según lo informado por él y Ounis [14].• El alcance de la consulta se relaciona con las FDI de toda la consulta, como en: c1 = log (#Documentsincollection #hits (consulta)) (7) Esta métrica funciona bien cuando se usa con colecciones de documentos que cubren un solo tema, pero de lo contrario [7 de lo contrario [7, 14].• La claridad de la consulta [7] parece ser la mejor, así como la técnica más aplicada hasta ahora. Mide la divergencia entre el modelo de idioma asociado a la consulta de usuario y el modelo de idioma asociado a la colección. En una versión simplificada (es decir, sin suavizar los términos que no están presentes en la consulta), se puede expresar de la siguiente manera: c2 = w∈Query pml (w | consulta) · log pml (w | consulta) pcoll (w) (8) donde pml (w | consulta) es la probabilidad de la palabra w dentro de la consulta enviada, y pcoll (w) es la probabilidad de w dentro de toda la colección de documentos. Existen otras soluciones, pero creemos que son demasiado costosas computacionalmente para la gran cantidad de datos que deben procesarse dentro de las aplicaciones web. Por lo tanto, decidimos investigar solo C1 y C2. Primero, analizamos su rendimiento en un gran conjunto de consultas y dividimos sus predicciones de claridad en tres categorías: • Pequeño alcance / consulta clara: C1 ∈ [0, 12], C2 ∈ [4, ∞).• Medio alcance / consulta semi-ambigua: c1 ∈ [12, 17), c2 ∈ [2.5, 4).• Alcance grande / consulta ambigua: c1 ∈ [17, ∞), c2 ∈ [0, 2.5]. Para limitar la cantidad de experimentos, analizamos solo los resultados producidos al emplear C1 para el PIR y C2 para la web. Como base algorítmica, utilizamos LC [O], es decir, compuestos léxicos optimizados, que fue claramente el método ganador en el análisis anterior. Como la investigación manual mostró que se sobreportó ligeramente los términos de expansión para consultas claras, utilizamos un sustituto de este caso particular. Se consideraron dos candidatos: (1) TF, es decir, el segundo mejor enfoque, y (2) Wn [Syn], como observamos que sus términos de expansión primero y segundo a menudo eran muy buenos. Escopio de escritorio Claridad web No. de Algoritmo de términos Grande ambiguo 4 lc [o] Gran semi-ambig.3 lc [o] grande transparente 2 lc [o] medio ambiguo 3 lc [o] medio ambig medio.2 lc [o] medio claro 1 tf / wn [syn] pequeño ambiguo 2 tf / wn [syn] pequeño semi-ambig.1 tf / wn [syn] pequeño transparente 0 table 3: expansión de consulta personalizada adaptativa. Dados los algoritmos y las medidas de claridad, implementamos el procedimiento de adaptación adaptando la cantidad de términos de expansión agregados a la consulta original, en función de su ambigüedad en la web, así como dentro de los usuarios PIR. Tenga en cuenta que el nivel de ambigüedad está relacionado con el número de documentos que cubren una determinada consulta. Por lo tanto, hasta cierto punto, tiene diferentes significados en la web y dentro de PIRS. Si bien una consulta considerada ambigua en una gran colección, como la web, muy probablemente tendrá una gran cantidad de significados, este puede no ser el caso del escritorio. Tome, por ejemplo, el PageRank de consulta. Si el usuario es un experto en análisis de enlaces, muchos de sus documentos podrían coincidir con este término y, por lo tanto, la consulta se clasificaría como ambigua. Sin embargo, cuando se analiza contra la web, esta es definitivamente una consulta clara. En consecuencia, empleamos más términos adicionales, cuando la consulta era más ambigua en la web, pero también en el escritorio. Dicho de otra manera, las consultas consideradas claras en el escritorio inherentemente no estaban bien cubiertas dentro de los usuarios PIR y, por lo tanto, tenían menos palabras clave adjuntas. El número de términos de expansión que utilizamos para cada combinación de niveles de alcance y claridad se representa en la Tabla 3. Proceso de formulación de consultas. La expansión de consulta interactiva tiene un alto potencial para mejorar la búsqueda [29]. Creemos que modelar su proceso subyacente sería muy útil para producir algoritmos de búsqueda web adaptativos cualitativos. Por ejemplo, cuando el usuario está agregando un nuevo término a su consulta emitida anteriormente, básicamente está reformulando su solicitud original. Por lo tanto, es más probable que los términos recién agregados transmitan información sobre sus objetivos de búsqueda. Para un motor de recuperación general no personalizado, esto podría corresponder a dar más peso a estas nuevas palabras clave. Dentro de nuestro escenario personalizado, las expansiones generadas pueden ser sesgadas de manera similar hacia estos términos. Sin embargo, se necesitan más investigaciones para resolver los desafíos que plantea este enfoque. Otras características. La idea de adaptar el proceso de recuperación a varios aspectos de la consulta, del propio usuario e incluso del algoritmo empleado ha recibido solo poca atención en la literatura. Solo se han investigado algunos enfoques, generalmente indirectamente. Existen estudios de comportamientos de consulta en diferentes momentos del día, o de los temas abarcados por las consultas de varias clases de usuarios, etc. Sin embargo, generalmente no discuten cómo estas características pueden incorporarse realmente en el proceso de búsqueda en sí y casi nunca se han relacionado con la tarea de personalización web.4.2 Experimentos Utilizamos exactamente la misma configuración experimental que para nuestro análisis anterior, con dos consultas basadas en registros y dos autoseleccionadas (todos diferentes de antes, para asegurarse de que no haya sesgo en los nuevos enfoques), evaluado conNDCG sobre la salida de resultados de los 5 mejores por cada algoritmo. Los algoritmos de expansión de consultas personalizados adaptativos recientemente propuestos se denotan como un [LCO/TF] para el enfoque utilizando TF con las consultas de escritorio claras y como [LCO/WN] cuando se utilizó WN [SYN] en lugar de TF. Los resultados generales fueron al menos similares o mejores que Google para todo tipo de consultas de registro (ver Tabla 4). Para las consultas frecuentes superiores, el algoritmo NDCG significado.

También logran una mejora de hasta 6.62% sobre el algoritmo estático de mejor rendimiento, LC [O] (P = 0.07). Para consultas seleccionadas al azar, a pesar de que A [LCO/TF] produce resultados significativamente mejores que Google (P = 0.04), ambos enfoques adaptativos quedan detrás de los algoritmos estáticos. La razón principal parece ser la selección imperfecta del número de términos de expansión, en función de la claridad de consulta. Por lo tanto, se necesitan más experimentos para determinar el número óptimo de palabras clave de expansión generadas, en función del nivel de ambigüedad de consulta. El análisis de las consultas autoseleccionadas muestra que la adaptación puede traer aún más mejoras a la personalización de la búsqueda web (ver Tabla 5). Para consultas ambiguas, los puntajes dados a la búsqueda de Google se mejoran en un 40,6% a través de un [LCO/TF] y en un 35,2% a través de un [LCO/WN], ambos muy significativos con P 0,01. La adaptación también trae otra mejora del 8,9% sobre la personalización estática de LC [O] (p = 0,05). Incluso para consultas claras, los algoritmos flexibles recientemente propuestos funcionan ligeramente mejor, mejorando con 0.4% y 1.0% respectivamente. Todos los resultados se representan gráficamente en la Figura 1. Notamos que un [LCO/TF] es el mejor algoritmo general, que funciona mejor que Google para todo tipo de consultas, ya sea extraída del registro del motor de búsqueda o autoseleccionada. Los experimentos presentados en esta sección confirman claramente que la adaptación es un paso más necesario para tomar la personalización de la búsqueda web.5. Conclusiones y trabajo adicional En este documento propusimos expandir las consultas de búsqueda web explotando el repositorio de información personal de los usuarios para extraer automáticamente palabras clave adicionales relacionadas tanto con la consulta en sí como a los intereses de los usuarios, personalizando la salida de búsqueda. En este contexto, el documento incluye las siguientes contribuciones: • Propusimos cinco técnicas para determinar los términos de expansión de los documentos personales. Cada uno de ellos produce palabras clave de consulta adicionales mediante el análisis de los usuarios de escritorio al aumento de los niveles de granularidad, que van desde el análisis del nivel de término y de expresión hasta las estadísticas de co-ocurrencia globales y los tesauros externos. Figura 1: ganancia relativa de NDCG (en %) para cada algoritmo en general, así como por categoría de consulta separada.• Proporcionamos un análisis empírico exhaustivo de varias variantes de nuestros enfoques, en cuatro escenarios diferentes. Mostramos algunos de estos enfoques para funcionar muy bien, produciendo mejoras de NDCG de hasta 51.28%.• Movimos este marco de búsqueda personalizado y propusimos para que el proceso de expansión sea adaptable a las características de cada consulta, un fuerte enfoque en su nivel de claridad.• Dentro de un conjunto separado de experimentos, mostramos que nuestros algoritmos adaptativos proporcionan una mejora adicional del 8,47% sobre el mejor enfoque previamente identificado. Actualmente estamos realizando investigaciones sobre la dependencia entre varias características de consulta y el número óptimo de términos de expansión. También estamos analizando otros tipos de enfoques para identificar sugerencias de expansión de consultas, como la aplicación de análisis semántico latente en los datos de escritorio. Finalmente, estamos diseñando un conjunto de combinaciones más complejas de estas métricas para proporcionar una mejor adaptación a nuestros algoritmos.6.

        "Subsequently, we move this personalized search framework one step further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to various features of each query.",

        "INTRODUCTION The booming popularity of search engines has determined simple keyword search to become the only widely accepted user interface for seeking information over the Web.",
        "Yet keyword queries are inherently ambiguous.",
        "The query canon book for example covers several different areas of interest: religion, photography, literature, and music.",
        "Clearly, one would prefer search output to be aligned with users topic(s) of interest, rather than displaying a selection of popular URLs from each category.",
        "Studies have shown that more than 80% of the users would prefer to receive such personalized search results [33] instead of the currently generic ones.",
        "Query expansion assists the user in formulating a better query, by appending additional keywords to the initial search request in order to encapsulate her interests therein, as well as to focus the Web search output accordingly.",
        "It has been shown to perform very well over large data sets, especially with short input queries (see for example [19, 3]).",
        "This is exactly the Web search scenario!",
        "In this paper we propose to enhance Web query reformulation by exploiting the users Personal Information Repository (PIR), i.e., the personal collection of text documents, emails, cached Web pages, etc.",
        "Several advantages arise when moving Web search personalization down to the Desktop level (note that by Desktop we refer to PIR, and we use the two terms interchangeably).",
        "First is of course the quality of personalization: The local Desktop is a rich repository of information, accurately describing most, if not all interests of the user.",
        "Second, as all profile information is stored and exploited locally, on the personal machine, another very important benefit is privacy.",
        "Search engines should not be able to know about a persons interests, i.e., they should not be able to connect a specific person with the queries she issued, or worse, with the output URLs she clicked within the search interface1 (see Volokh [35] for a discussion on privacy issues related to personalized Web search).",
        "Our algorithms expand Web queries with keywords extracted from users PIR, thus implicitly personalizing the search output.",
        "After a discussion of previous works in Section 2, we first investigate the analysis of local Desktop query context in Section 3.1.1.",
        "We propose several keyword, expression, and summary based techniques for determining expansion terms from those personal documents matching the Web query best.",
        "In Section 3.1.2 we move our analysis to the global Desktop collection and investigate expansions based on co-occurrence metrics and external thesauri.",
        "The experiments presented in Section 3.2 show many of these approaches to perform very well, especially on ambiguous queries, producing NDCG [15] improvements of up to 51.28%.",
        "In Section 4 we move this algorithmic framework further and propose to make the expansion process adaptive to the clarity level of the query.",
        "This yields an additional improvement of 8.47% over the previously identified best algorithm.",
        "We conclude and discuss further work in Section 5. 1 Search engines can map queries at least to IP addresses, for example by using cookies and mining the query logs.",
        "However, by moving the user profile at the Desktop level we ensure such information is not explicitly associated to a particular user and stored on the search engine side. 2.",
        "PREVIOUS WORK This paper brings together two IR areas: Search Personalization and Automatic Query Expansion.",
        "There exists a vast amount of algorithms for both domains.",
        "However, not much has been done specifically aimed at combining them.",
        "In this section we thus present a separate analysis, first introducing some approaches to personalize search, as this represents the main goal of our research, and then discussing several query expansion techniques and their relationship to our algorithms. 2.1 Personalized Search Personalized search comprises two major components: (1) User profiles, and (2) The actual search algorithm.",
        "This section splits the relevant background according to the focus of each article into either one of these elements.",
        "Approaches focused on the User Profile.",
        "Sugiyama et al. [32] analyzed surfing behavior and generated user profiles as features (terms) of the visited pages.",
        "Upon issuing a new query, the search results were ranked based on the similarity between each URL and the user profile.",
        "Qiu and Cho [26] used Machine Learning on the past click history of the user in order to determine topic preference vectors and then apply Topic-Sensitive PageRank [13].",
        "User profiling based on browsing history has the advantage of being rather easy to obtain and process.",
        "This is probably why it is also employed by several industrial search engines (e.g., Yahoo!",
        "MyWeb2 ).",
        "However, it is definitely not sufficient for gathering a thorough insight into users interests.",
        "More, it requires to store all personal information at the server side, which raises significant privacy concerns.",
        "Only two other approaches enhanced Web search using Desktop data, yet both used different core ideas: (1) Teevan et al. [34] modified the query term weights from the BM25 weighting scheme to incorporate user interests as captured by their Desktop indexes; (2) In Chirita et al. [6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",
        "Moreover, none of these investigated the adaptive application of personalization.",
        "Approaches focused on the Personalization Algorithm.",
        "Effectively building the personalization aspect directly into PageRank [25] (i.e., by biasing it on a target set of pages) has received much attention recently.",
        "Haveliwala [13] computed a topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity between the user query and each of the 16 topics.",
        "More recently, Nie et al. [24] modified the idea by distributing the PageRank of a page across the topics it contains in order to generate topic oriented rankings.",
        "Jeh and Widom [16] proposed an algorithm that avoids the massive resources needed for storing one Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV) per user by precomputing PPVs only for a small set of pages and then applying linear combination.",
        "As the computation of PPVs for larger sets of pages was still quite expensive, several solutions have been investigated, the most important ones being those of Fogaras and Racz [12], and Sarlos et al. [30], the latter using rounding and count-min sketching in order to fastly obtain accurate enough approximations of the personalized scores. 2.2 Automatic Query Expansion Automatic query expansion aims at deriving a better formulation of the user query in order to enhance retrieval.",
        "It is based on exploiting various social or collection specific characteristics in order to generate additional terms, which are appended to the original in2 http://myWeb2.search.yahoo.com put keywords before identifying the matching documents returned as output.",
        "In this section we survey some of the representative query expansion works grouped according to the source employed to generate additional terms: (1) Relevance feedback, (2) Collection based co-occurrence statistics, and (3) Thesaurus information.",
        "Some other approaches are also addressed in the end of the section.",
        "Relevance Feedback Techniques.",
        "The main idea of Relevance Feedback (RF) is that useful information can be extracted from the relevant documents returned for the initial query.",
        "First approaches were manual [28] in the sense that the user was the one choosing the relevant results, and then various methods were applied to extract new terms, related to the query and the selected documents.",
        "Efthimiadis [11] presented a comprehensive literature review and proposed several simple methods to extract such new keywords based on term frequency, document frequency, etc.",
        "We used some of these as inspiration for our Desktop specific techniques.",
        "Chang and Hsu [5] asked users to choose relevant clusters, instead of documents, thus reducing the amount of interaction necessary.",
        "RF has also been shown to be effectively automatized by considering the top ranked documents as relevant [37] (this is known as Pseudo RF).",
        "Lam and Jones [21] used summarization to extract informative sentences from the top-ranked documents, and appended them to the user query.",
        "Carpineto et al. [4] maximized the divergence between the language model defined by the top retrieved documents and that defined by the entire collection.",
        "Finally, Yu et al. [38] selected the expansion terms from vision-based segments of Web pages in order to cope with the multiple topics residing therein.",
        "Co-occurrence Based Techniques.",
        "Terms highly co-occurring with the issued keywords have been shown to increase precision when appended to the query [17].",
        "Many statistical measures have been developed to best assess term relationship levels, either analyzing entire documents [27], lexical affinity relationships [3] (i.e., pairs of closely related words which contain exactly one of the initial query terms), etc.",
        "We have also investigated three such approaches in order to identify query relevant keywords from the rich, yet rather complex Personal Information Repository.",
        "Thesaurus Based Techniques.",
        "A broadly explored method is to expand the user query with new terms, whose meaning is closely related to the input keywords.",
        "Such relationships are usually extracted from large scale thesauri, as WordNet [23], in which various sets of synonyms, hypernyms, etc. are predefined.",
        "Just as for the co-occurrence methods, initial experiments with this approach were controversial, either reporting improvements, or even reductions in output quality [36].",
        "Recently, as the experimental collections grew larger, and as the employed algorithms became more complex, better results have been obtained [31, 18, 22].",
        "We also use WordNet based expansion terms.",
        "However, we base this process on analyzing the Desktop level relationship between the original query and the proposed new keywords.",
        "Other Techniques.",
        "There are many other attempts to extract expansion terms.",
        "Though orthogonal to our approach, two works are very relevant for the Web environment: Cui et al. [8] generated word correlations utilizing the probability for query terms to appear in each document, as computed over the search engine logs.",
        "Kraft and Zien [19] showed that anchor text is very similar to user queries, and thus exploited it to acquire additional keywords. 3.",
        "QUERY EXPANSION USING DESKTOP DATA Desktop data represents a very rich repository of profiling information.",
        "However, this information comes in a very unstructured way, covering documents which are highly diverse in format, content, and even language characteristics.",
        "In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository.",
        "Then, in the second part of the section we empirically analyze the performance of each approach. 3.1 Algorithms This section presents the five generic approaches for analyzing users Desktop data in order to provide expansion terms for Web search.",
        "In the proposed algorithms we gradually increase the amount of personal information utilized.",
        "Thus, in the first part we investigate three local analysis techniques focused only on those Desktop documents matching users query best.",
        "We append to the Web query the most relevant terms, compounds, and sentence summaries from these documents.",
        "In the second part of the section we move towards a global Desktop analysis, proposing to investigate term co-occurrences, as well as thesauri, in the expansion process. 3.1.1 Expanding with Local Desktop Analysis Local Desktop Analysis is related to enhancing Pseudo Relevance Feedback to generate query expansion keywords from the PIR best hits for users Web query, rather than from the top ranked Web search results.",
        "We distinguish three granularity levels for this process and we investigate each of them separately.",
        "Term and Document Frequency.",
        "As the simplest possible measures, TF and DF have the advantage of being very fast to compute.",
        "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
        "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
        "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
        "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
        "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
        "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
        "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
        "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",
        "Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores.",
        "Note that a hybrid TFxIDF approach is not necessarily efficient, since one Desktop term might have a high DF on the Desktop, while being quite rare in the Web.",
        "For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF.",
        "However, as it is rather rare in the Web, it would make a good resolution of the query towards the correct topic.",
        "Lexical Compounds.",
        "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
        "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
        "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
        "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
        "Sentence Selection.",
        "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
        "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
        "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
        "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
        "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",
        "The second term is a position score set to (Avg(NS) − SentenceIndex)/Avg2 (NS) for the first ten sentences, and to 0 otherwise, Avg(NS) being the average number of sentences over all Desktop items.",
        "This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning.",
        "However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant.",
        "The final term biases the summary towards the query.",
        "It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query.",
        "It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms.",
        "In this section we propose two such techniques, namely term co-occurrence statistics, and filtering the output of an external thesaurus.",
        "Term Co-occurrence Statistics.",
        "For each term, we can easily compute off-line those terms co-occurring with it most frequently in a given collection (i.e., PIR in our case), and then exploit this information at run-time in order to infer keywords highly correlated with the user query.",

        "The off-line computation needs an initial trimming phase (step 1) for optimization purposes.",
        "In addition, we also restricted the algorithm to computing co-occurrence levels across nouns only, as they contain by far the largest amount of conceptual information, and as this approach reduces the size of the co-occurrence matrix considerably.",
        "During the run-time phase, having the terms most correlated with each particular query keyword already identified, one more operation is necessary, namely calculating the correlation of every output term with the entire query.",
        "Two approaches are possible: (1) using a product of the correlation between the term and all keywords in the original expression (step 5a), or (2) simply counting the number of documents in which the proposed term co-occurs with the entire user query (step 5b).",
        "We considered the following formulas for Similarity Coefficients [17]: • Cosine Similarity, defined as: CS = DFx,y pDFx · DFy (2) • Mutual Information, defined as: MI = log N · DFx,y DFx · DFy (3) • Likelihood Ratio, defined in the paragraphs below.",
        "DFx is the Document Frequency of term x, and DFx,y is the number of documents containing both x and y.",
        "To further increase the quality of the generated scores we limited the latter indicator to cooccurrences within a window of W terms.",
        "We set W to be the same as the maximum amount of expansion keywords desired.",
        "Dunnings Likelihood Ratio λ [9] is a co-occurrence based metric similar to χ2 .",
        "It starts by attempting to reject the null hypothesis, according to which two terms A and B would appear in text independently from each other.",
        "This means that P(A B) = P(A¬B) = P(A), where P(A¬B) is the probability that term A is not followed by term B. Consequently, the test for independence of A and B can be performed by looking if the distribution of A given that B is present is the same as the distribution of A given that B is not present.",
        "Of course, in reality we know these terms are not independent in text, and we only use the statistical metrics to highlight terms which are frequently appearing together.",
        "We compare the two binomial processes by using likelihood ratios of their associated hypotheses.",
        "First, let us define the likelihood ratio for one hypothesis: λ = maxω∈Ω0 H(ω; k) maxω∈Ω H(ω; k) (4) where ω is a point in the parameter space Ω, Ω0 is the particular hypothesis being tested, and k is a point in the space of observations K. If we assume that two binomial distributions have the same underlying parameter, i.e., {(p1, p2) | p1 = p2}, we can write: λ = maxp H(p, p; k1, k2, n1, n2) maxp1,p2 H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) (5) where H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) = pk1 1 · (1 − p1)(n1−k1) ·  n1 k1 ¡ · pk2 2 · (1 − p2)(n2−k2) ·  n2 k2 ¡ .",
        "Since the maxima are obtained with p1 = k1 n1 , p2 = k2 n2 , and p = k1+k2 n1+n2 , we have: λ = maxp L(p, k1, n1)L(p, k2, n2) maxp1,p2 L(p1, k1, n1)L(p2, k2, n2) (6) where L(p, k, n) = pk · (1 − p)n−k .",
        "Taking the logarithm of the likelihood, we obtain: −2 · log λ = 2 · [log L(p1, k1, n1) + log L(p2, k2, n2) − log L(p, k1, n1) − log L(p, k2, n2)] where log L(p, k, n) = k · log p + (n − k) · log(1 − p).",
        "Finally, if we write O11 = P(A B), O12 = P(¬A B), O21 = P(A ¬B), and O22 = P(¬A¬B), then the co-occurrence likelihood of terms A and B becomes: −2 · log λ = 2 · [O11 · log p1 + O12 · log (1 − p1) + O21 · log p2 + O22 · log (1 − p2) − (O11 + O21) · log p − (O12 + O22) · log (1 − p)] where p1 = k1 n1 = O11 O11+O12 , p2 = k2 n2 = O21 O21+O22 , and p = k1+k2 n1+n2 Thesaurus Based Expansion.",

        "We observe three types of term relationships (steps 2a-2c): (1) synonyms, (2) sub-concepts, namely hyponyms (i.e., sub-classes) and meronyms (i.e., sub-parts), and (3) super-concepts, namely hypernyms (i.e., super-classes) and holonyms (i.e., super-parts).",

        "In order to connect such a query to each users interests, we added an off-line preprocessing phase: We generated the most frequent search requests and then randomly selected a query with at least 10 hits on each subjects Desktop.",
        "To further ensure a real life scenario, users were allowed to reject the proposed query and ask for a new one, if they considered it totally outside their interest areas. • One randomly selected log query, filtered using the same procedure as above. • One self-selected specific query, which they thought to have only one meaning. • One self-selected ambiguous query, which they thought to have at least three meanings.",
        "The average query lengths were 2.0 and 2.3 terms for the log queries, as well as 2.9 and 1.8 for the self-selected ones.",

        "Note that the former ones were somewhat farther away from each subjects interest, thus being also more difficult to personalize on.",
        "To gain an insight into the relationship between each query type and user interests, we asked each person to rate the query itself with a score of 1 to 5, having the following interpretations: (1) never heard of it, (2) do not know it, but heard of it, (3) know it partially, (4) know it well, (5) major interest.",
        "The obtained grades were 3.11 for the top log queries, 3.72 for the randomly selected ones, 4.45 for the self-selected specific ones, and 4.39 for the self-selected ambiguous ones.",
        "For each query, we collected the Top-5 URLs generated by 20 versions of the algorithms4 presented in Section 3.1.",
        "These results were then shuffled into one set containing usually between 70 and 90 URLs.",

        "Overall, 72 queries were issued and over 6,000 URLs were evaluated during the experiment.",
        "For each of these URLs, the testers had to give a rating ranging from 0 to 2, dividing the relevant results in two categories, (1) relevant and (2) highly relevant.",
        "Finally, the quality of each ranking was assessed using the normalized version of Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) [15].",
        "DCG is a rich measure, as it gives more weight to highly ranked documents, while also incorporating different relevance levels by giving them different gain values: DCG(i) = & G(1) , if i = 1 DCG(i − 1) + G(i)/log(i) , otherwise.",
        "We used G(i) = 1 for relevant results, and G(i) = 2 for highly relevant ones.",

[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",

                "In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository.",

                "We distinguish three granularity levels for this process and we investigate each of them separately.",
                "Term and Document Frequency.",
                "As the simplest possible measures, TF and DF have the advantage of being very fast to compute.",
                "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
                "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",
                "Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores.",

                "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
                "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
                "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
                "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
                "Sentence Selection.",
                "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
                "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
                "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
                "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
                "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",

                "This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning.",
                "However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant.",
                "The final term biases the summary towards the query.",
                "It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query.",
                "It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms.",

                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",

[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",

                "Haveliwala [13] computed a topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity between the user query and each of the 16 topics.",
                "More recently, Nie et al. [24] modified the idea by distributing the PageRank of a page across the topics it contains in order to generate topic oriented rankings.",

                "In this section we discuss the factors influencing the behavior of our expansion algorithms, which might be used as input for the adaptivity process.",
                "Then, in the second part we present some initial experiments with one of them, namely query clarity. 4.1 Adaptivity Factors Several indicators could assist the algorithm to automatically tune the number of expansion terms.",
                "We start by discussing adaptation by analyzing the query clarity level.",
                "Then, we briefly introduce an approach to model the generic query formulation process in order to tailor the search algorithm automatically, and discuss some other possible factors that might be of use for this task.",
                "Query Clarity.",
                "The interest for analyzing query difficulty has increased only recently, and there are not many papers addressing this topic.",
                "Yet it has been long known that query disambiguation has a high potential of improving retrieval effectiveness for low recall searches with very short queries [20], which is exactly our targeted scenario.",
                "Also, the success of IR systems clearly varies across different topics.",
                "We thus propose to use an estimate number expressing the calculated level of query clarity in order to automatically tweak the amount of personalization fed into the algorithm.",
                "The following metrics are available: • The Query Length is expressed simply by the number of words in the user query.",
                "The solution is rather inefficient, as reported by He and Ounis [14]. • The Query Scope relates to the IDF of the entire query, as in: C1 = log( #DocumentsInCollection #Hits(Query) ) (7) This metric performs well when used with document collections covering a single topic, but poor otherwise [7, 14]. • The Query Clarity [7] seems to be the best, as well as the most applied technique so far.",
                "It measures the divergence between the language model associated to the user query and the language model associated to the collection.",
                "In a simplified version (i.e., without smoothing over the terms which are not present in the query), it can be expressed as follows: C2 =  w∈Query Pml(w|Query) · log Pml(w|Query) Pcoll(w) (8) where Pml(w|Query) is the probability of the word w within the submitted query, and Pcoll(w) is the probability of w within the entire collection of documents.",
                "Other solutions exist, but we think they are too computationally expensive for the huge amount of data that needs to be processed within Web applications.",
                "We thus decided to investigate only C1 and C2.",
                "First, we analyzed their performance over a large set of queries and split their clarity predictions in three categories: • Small Scope / Clear Query: C1 ∈ [0, 12], C2 ∈ [4, ∞). • Medium Scope / Semi-Ambiguous Query: C1 ∈ [12, 17), C2 ∈ [2.5, 4). • Large Scope / Ambiguous Query: C1 ∈ [17, ∞), C2 ∈ [0, 2.5].",
                "In order to limit the amount of experiments, we analyzed only the results produced when employing C1 for the PIR and C2 for the Web.",
                "As algorithmic basis we used LC[O], i.e., optimized lexical compounds, which was clearly the winning method in the previous analysis.",
                "As manual investigation showed it to slightly overfit the expansion terms for clear queries, we utilized a substitute for this particular case.",
                "Two candidates were considered: (1) TF, i.e., the second best approach, and (2) WN[SYN], as we observed that its first and second expansion terms were often very good.",

                "Given the algorithms and clarity measures, we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query, as a function of its ambiguity in the Web, as well as within users PIR.",
                "Note that the ambiguity level is related to the number of documents covering a certain query.",
                "Thus, to some extent, it has different meanings on the Web and within PIRs.",
                "While a query deemed ambiguous on a large collection such as the Web will very likely indeed have a large number of meanings, this may not be the case for the Desktop.",
                "Take for example the query PageRank.",
                "If the user is a link analysis expert, many of her documents might match this term, and thus the query would be classified as ambiguous.",
                "However, when analyzed against the Web, this is definitely a clear query.",
                "Consequently, we employed more additional terms, when the query was more ambiguous in the Web, but also on the Desktop.",
                "Put another way, queries deemed clear on the Desktop were inherently not well covered within users PIR, and thus had fewer keywords appended to them.",
                "The number of expansion terms we utilized for each combination of scope and clarity levels is depicted in Table 3.",
                "Query Formulation Process.",
                "Interactive query expansion has a high potential for enhancing search [29].",
                "We believe that modeling its underlying process would be very helpful in producing qualitative adaptive Web search algorithms.",
                "For example, when the user is adding a new term to her previously issued query, she is basically reformulating her original request.",
                "Thus, the newly added terms are more likely to convey information about her search goals.",
                "For a general, non personalized retrieval engine, this could correspond to giving more weight to these new keywords.",
                "Within our personalized scenario, the generated expansions can similarly be biased towards these terms.",
                "Nevertheless, more investigations are necessary in order to solve the challenges posed by this approach.",
                "Other Features.",
                "The idea of adapting the retrieval process to various aspects of the query, of the user itself, and even of the employed algorithm has received only little attention in the literature.",
                "Only some approaches have been investigated, usually indirectly.",
                "There exist studies of query behaviors at different times of day, or of the topics spanned by the queries of various classes of users, etc.",
                "However, they generally do not discuss how these features can be actually incorporated in the search process itself and they have almost never been related to the task of Web personalization. 4.2 Experiments We used exactly the same experimental setup as for our previous analysis, with two log-based queries and two self-selected ones (all different from before, in order to make sure there is no bias on the new approaches), evaluated with NDCG over the Top-5 results output by each algorithm.",
                "The newly proposed adaptive personalized query expansion algorithms are denoted as A[LCO/TF] for the approach using TF with the clear Desktop queries, and as A[LCO/WN] when WN[SYN] was utilized instead of TF.",
                "The overall results were at least similar, or better than Google for all kinds of log queries (see Table 4).",

                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",

                "We also use WordNet based expansion terms.",

                "However, this information comes in a very unstructured way, covering documents which are highly diverse in format, content, and even language characteristics.",
                "In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository.",
                "Then, in the second part of the section we empirically analyze the performance of each approach. 3.1 Algorithms This section presents the five generic approaches for analyzing users Desktop data in order to provide expansion terms for Web search.",

                "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
                "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",
                "Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores.",
                "Note that a hybrid TFxIDF approach is not necessarily efficient, since one Desktop term might have a high DF on the Desktop, while being quite rare in the Web.",
                "For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF.",
                "However, as it is rather rare in the Web, it would make a good resolution of the query towards the correct topic.",
                "Lexical Compounds.",
                "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
                "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
                "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
                "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
                "Sentence Selection.",
                "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
                "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
                "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
                "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
                "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",
                "The second term is a position score set to (Avg(NS) − SentenceIndex)/Avg2 (NS) for the first ten sentences, and to 0 otherwise, Avg(NS) being the average number of sentences over all Desktop items.",
                "This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning.",
                "However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant.",
                "The final term biases the summary towards the query.",
                "It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query.",
                "It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms.",

[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",

                "Effectively building the personalization aspect directly into PageRank [25] (i.e., by biasing it on a target set of pages) has received much attention recently.",
                "Haveliwala [13] computed a topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity between the user query and each of the 16 topics.",

                "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
                "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",

                "For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF.",

                "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
                "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
                "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
                "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
                "Sentence Selection.",
                "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
                "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
                "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
                "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
                "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",

                "However, not much has been done specifically aimed at combining them.",
                "In this section we thus present a separate analysis, first introducing some approaches to personalize search, as this represents the main goal of our research, and then discussing several query expansion techniques and their relationship to our algorithms. 2.1 Personalized Search Personalized search comprises two major components: (1) User profiles, and (2) The actual search algorithm.",

                "Only two other approaches enhanced Web search using Desktop data, yet both used different core ideas: (1) Teevan et al. [34] modified the query term weights from the BM25 weighting scheme to incorporate user interests as captured by their Desktop indexes; (2) In Chirita et al. [6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",

                "Effectively building the personalization aspect directly into PageRank [25] (i.e., by biasing it on a target set of pages) has received much attention recently.",
                "Haveliwala [13] computed a topicoriented PageRank, in which 16 PageRank vectors biased on each of the main topics of the Open Directory were initially calculated off-line, and then combined at run-time based on the similarity between the user query and each of the 16 topics.",
                "More recently, Nie et al. [24] modified the idea by distributing the PageRank of a page across the topics it contains in order to generate topic oriented rankings.",
                "Jeh and Widom [16] proposed an algorithm that avoids the massive resources needed for storing one Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV) per user by precomputing PPVs only for a small set of pages and then applying linear combination.",
                "As the computation of PPVs for larger sets of pages was still quite expensive, several solutions have been investigated, the most important ones being those of Fogaras and Racz [12], and Sarlos et al. [30], the latter using rounding and count-min sketching in order to fastly obtain accurate enough approximations of the personalized scores. 2.2 Automatic Query Expansion Automatic query expansion aims at deriving a better formulation of the user query in order to enhance retrieval.",
                "It is based on exploiting various social or collection specific characteristics in order to generate additional terms, which are appended to the original in2 http://myWeb2.search.yahoo.com put keywords before identifying the matching documents returned as output.",

                "Just as for the co-occurrence methods, initial experiments with this approach were controversial, either reporting improvements, or even reductions in output quality [36].",
                "Recently, as the experimental collections grew larger, and as the employed algorithms became more complex, better results have been obtained [31, 18, 22].",
                "We also use WordNet based expansion terms.",
                "However, we base this process on analyzing the Desktop level relationship between the original query and the proposed new keywords.",

                "In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository.",
                "Then, in the second part of the section we empirically analyze the performance of each approach. 3.1 Algorithms This section presents the five generic approaches for analyzing users Desktop data in order to provide expansion terms for Web search.",

                "In the second part of the section we move towards a global Desktop analysis, proposing to investigate term co-occurrences, as well as thesauri, in the expansion process. 3.1.1 Expanding with Local Desktop Analysis Local Desktop Analysis is related to enhancing Pseudo Relevance Feedback to generate query expansion keywords from the PIR best hits for users Web query, rather than from the top ranked Web search results.",
                "We distinguish three granularity levels for this process and we investigate each of them separately.",
                "Term and Document Frequency.",
                "As the simplest possible measures, TF and DF have the advantage of being very fast to compute.",
                "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
                "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",
                "Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores.",
                "Note that a hybrid TFxIDF approach is not necessarily efficient, since one Desktop term might have a high DF on the Desktop, while being quite rare in the Web.",
                "For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF.",
                "However, as it is rather rare in the Web, it would make a good resolution of the query towards the correct topic.",
                "Lexical Compounds.",
                "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
                "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
                "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
                "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
                "Sentence Selection.",
                "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
                "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
                "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
                "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
                "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",
                "The second term is a position score set to (Avg(NS) − SentenceIndex)/Avg2 (NS) for the first ten sentences, and to 0 otherwise, Avg(NS) being the average number of sentences over all Desktop items.",
                "This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning.",
                "However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant.",
                "The final term biases the summary towards the query.",
                "It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query.",
                "It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms.",
                "In this section we propose two such techniques, namely term co-occurrence statistics, and filtering the output of an external thesaurus.",
                "Term Co-occurrence Statistics.",
                "For each term, we can easily compute off-line those terms co-occurring with it most frequently in a given collection (i.e., PIR in our case), and then exploit this information at run-time in order to infer keywords highly correlated with the user query.",

If we assume that two binomial distributions have the same underlying parameter, i.e., {(p1, p2) | p1 = p2}, we can write: λ = maxp H(p, p; k1, k2, n1, n2) maxp1,p2 H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) (5) where H(p1, p2; k1, k2, n1, n2) = pk1 1 · (1 − p1)(n1−k1) ·  n1 k1 ¡ · pk2 2 · (1 − p2)(n2−k2) ·  n2 k2 ¡ .",

[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",

                "In this section we first tackle this problem by proposing several lexical analysis algorithms which exploit users PIR to extract keyword expansion terms at various granularities, ranging from term frequency within Desktop documents up to utilizing global co-occurrence statistics over the personal information repository.",

                "Previous experiments with small data sets have showed them to yield very good results [11].",
                "We thus independently associate a score with each term, based on each of the two statistics.",
                "The TF based one is obtained by multiplying the actual frequency of a term with a position score descending as the term first appears closer to the end of the document.",
                "This is necessary especially for longer documents, because more informative terms tend to appear towards their beginning [10].",
                "The complete TF based keyword extraction formula is as follows: TermScore = 1 2 + 1 2 · nrWords − pos nrWords ! · log(1 + TF) (1) where nrWords is the total number of terms in the document and pos is the position of the first appearance of the term; TF represents the frequency of each term in the Desktop document matching users Web query.",
                "The identification of suitable expansion terms is even simpler when using DF: Given the set of Top-K relevant Desktop documents, generate their snippets as focused on the original search request.",
                "This query orientation is necessary, since the DF scores are computed at the level of the entire PIR and would produce too noisy suggestions otherwise.",
                "Once the set of candidate terms has been identified, the selection proceeds by ordering them according to the DF scores they are associated with.",
                "Ties are resolved using the corresponding TF scores.",
                "Note that a hybrid TFxIDF approach is not necessarily efficient, since one Desktop term might have a high DF on the Desktop, while being quite rare in the Web.",
                "For example, the term PageRank would be quite frequent on the Desktop of an IR scientist, thus achieving a low score with TFxIDF.",
                "However, as it is rather rare in the Web, it would make a good resolution of the query towards the correct topic.",
                "Lexical Compounds.",
                "Anick and Tipirneni [2] defined the lexical dispersion hypothesis, according to which an expressions lexical dispersion (i.e., the number of different compounds it appears in within a document or group of documents) can be used to automatically identify key concepts over the input document set.",
                "Although several possible compound expressions are available, it has been shown that simple approaches based on noun analysis are almost as good as highly complex part-of-speech pattern identification algorithms [1].",
                "We thus inspect the matching Desktop documents for all their lexical compounds of the following form: { adjective? noun+ } All such compounds could be easily generated off-line, at indexing time, for all the documents in the local repository.",
                "Moreover, once identified, they can be further sorted depending on their dispersion within each document in order to facilitate fast retrieval of the most frequent compounds at run-time.",
                "Sentence Selection.",
                "This technique builds upon sentence oriented document summarization: First, the set of relevant Desktop documents is identified; then, a summary containing their most important sentences is generated as output.",
                "Sentence selection is the most comprehensive local analysis approach, as it produces the most detailed expansions (i.e., sentences).",
                "Its downside is that, unlike with the first two algorithms, its output cannot be stored efficiently, and consequently it cannot be computed off-line.",
                "We generate sentence based summaries by ranking the document sentences according to their salience score, as follows [21]: SentenceScore = SW2 TW + PS + TQ2 NQ The first term is the ratio between the square amount of significant words within the sentence and the total number of words therein.",
                "A word is significant in a document if its frequency is above a threshold as follows: TF > ms = V ` X 7 − 0.1 ∗ (25 − NS) , if NS < 25 7 , if NS ∈ [25, 40] 7 + 0.1 ∗ (NS − 40) , if NS > 40 with NS being the total number of sentences in the document (see [21] for details).",

                "This way, short documents such as emails are not affected, which is correct, since they usually do not contain a summary in the very beginning.",
                "However, as longer documents usually do include overall descriptive sentences in the beginning [10], these sentences are more likely to be relevant.",
                "The final term biases the summary towards the query.",
                "It is the ratio between the square number of query terms present in the sentence and the total number of terms from the query.",
                "It is based on the belief that the more query terms contained in a sentence, the more likely will that sentence convey information highly related to the query. 3.1.2 Expanding with Global Desktop Analysis In contrast to the previously presented approach, global analysis relies on information from across the entire personal Desktop to infer the new relevant query terms.",
                "In this section we propose two such techniques, namely term co-occurrence statistics, and filtering the output of an external thesaurus.",
                "Term Co-occurrence Statistics.",
                "For each term, we can easily compute off-line those terms co-occurring with it most frequently in a given collection (i.e., PIR in our case), and then exploit this information at run-time in order to infer keywords highly correlated with the user query.",

[6], we focused on re-ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing users interests.",
