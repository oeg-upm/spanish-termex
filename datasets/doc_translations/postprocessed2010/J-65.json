John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management Carnegie Mellon University acquisti@andrew.cmu.edu ABSTRACT Dichotomies between privacy attitudes and behavior have been noted in the literature but not yet fully explained. We apply lessons from the research on behavioral economics to understand the individual decision making process with respect to privacy in electronic commerce. We show that it is unrealistic to expect individual rationality in this context. Models of self-control problems and immediate gratification offer more realistic descriptions of the decision process and are more consistent with currently available data. In particular, we show why individuals who may genuinely want to protect their privacy might not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral literature; we show that these distortions may affect not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones; and we prove that this may occur also when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant. Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics; K.4.1 [Public Policy Issues]: Privacy General Terms Economics, Security, Human Factors 1. PRIVACY AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Privacy remains an important issue for electronic commerce. A PriceWaterhouseCoopers study in 2000 showed that nearly two thirds of the consumers surveyed would shop more online if they knew retail sites would not do anything with their personal information [15]. A Federal Trade Commission study reported in 2000 that sixty-seven percent of consumers were very concerned about the privacy of the personal information provided on-line [11]. More recently, a February 2002 Harris Interactive survey found that the three biggest consumer concerns in the area of on-line personal information security were: companies trading personal data without permission, the consequences of insecure transactions, and theft of personal data [19]. According to a Jupiter Research study in 2002, $24.5 billion in on-line sales will be lost by 2006 - up from $5.5 billion in 2001. Online retail sales would be approximately twenty-four percent higher in 2006 if consumers fears about privacy and security were addressed effectively [21]. Although the media hype has somewhat diminished, risks and costs have notas evidenced by the increasing volumes of electronic spam and identity theft [16]. Surveys in this field, however, as well as experiments and anecdotal evidence, have also painted a different picture. [36, 10, 18, 21] have found evidence that even privacy concerned individuals are willing to trade-off privacy for convenience, or bargain the release of very personal information in exchange for relatively small rewards. The failure of several on-line services aimed at providing anonymity for Internet users [6] offers additional indirect evidence of the reluctance by most individuals to spend any effort in protecting their personal information. The dichotomy between privacy attitudes and behavior has been highlighted in the literature. Preliminary interpretations of this phenomenon have been provided [2, 38, 33, 40]. Still missing are: an explanation grounded in economic or psychological theories; an empirical validation of the proposed explanation; and, of course, the answer to the most recurring question: should people bother at all about privacy? In this paper we focus on the first question: we formally analyze the individual decision making process with respect to privacy and its possible shortcomings. We focus on individual (mis)conceptions about their handling of risks they face when revealing private information. We do not address the issue of whether people should actually protect themselves. We will comment on that in Section 5, where we will also discuss strategies to empirically validate our theory. We apply lessons from behavioral economics. Traditional economics postulates that people are forward-looking and bayesian updaters: they take into account how current behavior will influence their future well-being and preferences. For example, [5] study rational models of addiction. This approach can be compared to those who see in the decision 21 not to protect ones privacy a rational choice given the (supposedly) low risks at stake. However, developments in the area of behavioral economics have highlighted various forms of psychological inconsistencies (self-control problems, hyperbolic discounting, present-biases, etc.) that clash with the fully rational view of the economic agent. In this paper we draw from these developments to reach the following conclusions: • We show that it is unlikely that individuals can act rationally in the economic sense when facing privacy sensitive decisions. • We show that alternative models of personal behavior and time-inconsistent preferences are compatible with the dichotomy between attitudes and behavior and can better match current data. For example, they can explain the results presented by [36] at the ACM EC 01 conference. In their experiment, self-proclaimed privacy advocates were found to be willing to reveal varying amounts of personal information in exchange for small rewards. • In particular, we show that individuals may have a tendency to under-protect themselves against the privacy risks they perceive, and over-provide personal information even when wary of (perceived) risks involved. • We show that the magnitude of the perceived costs of privacy under certain conditions will not act as deterrent against behavior the individual admits is risky. • We show, following similar studies in the economics of immediate gratification [31], that even sophisticated individuals may under certain conditions become privacy myopic. Our conclusion is that simply providing more information and awareness in a self-regulative environment is not sufficient to protect individual privacy. Improved technologies, by lowering costs of adoption and protection, certainly can help. However, more fundamental human behavioral responses must also be addressed if privacy ought to be protected. In the next section we propose a model of rational agents facing privacy sensitive decisions. In Section 3 we show the difficulties that hinder any model of privacy decision making based on full rationality. In Section 4 we show how behavioral models based on immediate gratification bias can better explain the attitudes-behavior dichotomy and match available data. In Section 5 we summarize and discuss our conclusions. 2. A MODEL OF RATIONALITY IN PRIVACY DECISION MAKING Some have used the dichotomy between privacy attitudes and behavior to claim that individuals are acting rationally when it comes to privacy. Under this view, individuals may accept small rewards for giving away information because they expect future damages to be even smaller (when discounted over time and with their probability of occurrence). Here we want to investigate what underlying assumptions about personal behavior would support the hypothesis of full rationality in privacy decision making. Since [28, 37, 29] economists have been interested in privacy, but only recently formal models have started appearing [3, 7, 39, 40]. While these studies focus on market interactions between one agent and other parties, here we are interested in formalizing the decision process of the single individual. We want to see if individuals can be economically rational (forward-lookers, bayesian updaters, utility maximizers, and so on) when it comes to protect their own personal information. The concept of privacy, once intended as the right to be left alone [41], has transformed as our society has become more information oriented. In an information society the self is expressed, defined, and affected through and by information and information technology. The boundaries between private and public become blurred. Privacy has therefore become more a class of multifaceted interests than a single, unambiguous concept. Hence its value may be discussed (if not ascertained) only once its context has also been specified. This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place. To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing. Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a). For instance, revealing ones identity to an on-line bookstore may earn a discount. Viceversa, it may also cost a larger bill, because of price discrimination. Protecting ones financial privacy by not divulging credit card information on-line may protect against future losses and hassles related to identity theft. But it may 1 See also [1]. 22 make ones on-line shopping experience more cumbersome, and therefore more expensive. The functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable weights and attitudes an individual may have towards keeping her information private (for example, her privacy sensitivity, or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect should be enforced by the government) and completing certain transactions. Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence. The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above. Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information. These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties. The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place. Similarly, the expected benefit from keeping information private will also be a collection over time of probability distributions dependent on several parameters. Imagine that the probability of keeping your financial transactions private is very high when you use a bank in Bermuda: still, the expected value from keeping your financial information confidential will depend on a number of other factors. A rational agent would, in theory, choose the technology d that maximizes her expected payoff in Equation 1. Maybe she would choose to complete the transaction under the protection of a privacy enhancing technology. Maybe she would complete the transaction without protection. Maybe she would not complete the transaction at all (d = 0). For example, the agent may consider the costs and benefits of sending an email through an anonymous MIX-net system [8] and compare those to the costs and benefits of sending that email through a conventional, non-anonymous channel. The magnitudes of the parameters in Equation 1 will change with the chosen technology. MIX-net systems may decrease the expected losses from privacy intrusions. Nonanonymous email systems may promise comparably higher reliability and (possibly) reduced costs of operations. 3. RATIONALITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTORTIONS IN PRIVACY Equation 1 is a comprehensive (while intentionally generic) road-map for navigation across privacy trade-offs that no human agent would be actually able to use. We hinted to some difficulties as we noted that several layers of complexities are hidden inside concepts such as the expected value of maintaining certain information private, and the probability of succeeding doing so. More precisely, an agent will face three problems when comparing the tradeoffs implicit in Equation 1: incomplete information about all parameters; bounded power to process all available information; no deviation from the rational path towards utilitymaximization. Those three problems are precisely the same issues real people have to deal with on an everyday basis as they face privacy-sensitive decisions. We discuss each problem in detail. 1. Incomplete information. What information has the individual access to as she prepares to take privacy sensitive decisions? For instance, is she aware of privacy invasions and the associated risks? What is her knowledge of the existence and characteristics of protective technologies? Economic transactions are often characterized by incomplete or asymmetric information. Different parties involved may not have the same amount of information about the transaction and may be uncertain about some important aspects of it [4]. Incomplete information will affect almost all parameters in Equation 1, and in particular the estimation of costs and benefits. Costs and benefits associated with privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both monetary and immaterial. Monetary costs may for instance include adoption costs (which are probably fixed) and usage costs (which are variable) of protective technologies - if the individual decides to protect herself. Or they may include the financial costs associated to identity theft, if the individuals information turns out not to have been adequately protected. Immaterial costs may include learning costs of a protective technology, switching costs between different applications, or social stigma when using anonymizing technologies, and many others. Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails). It is difficult for an individual to estimate all these values. Through information technology, privacy invasions can be ubiquitous and invisible. Many of the payoffs associated with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or ascertained only ex post through actual experience. Consider, for instance, the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting technologies described in [43]. In addition, the calculations implicit in Equation 1 depend on incomplete information about the probability distribution of future events. Some of those distributions may be predicted after comparable data - for example, the probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud today could be calculated using existing statistics. The probability distributions of other events may be very difficult to estimate because the environment is too dynamicfor example, the probability of being subject to identity theft 5 years in the future because of certain data you are releasing now. And the distributions of some other events may be almost completely subjective - for example, the probability that a new and practical form of attack on a currently secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal communications a few years from now. This leads to a related problem: bounded rationality. 2. Bounded rationality. Is the individual able to calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice? Or is she limited by bounded rationality? In our context, bounded rationality refers to the inability to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs associated with various strategies the individual may choose in privacy-sensitive situations. It also refers to the inability to process all the stochastic information related to risks and probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits. 23 In traditional economic theory, the agent is assumed to have both rationality and unbounded computational power to process information. But human agents are unable to process all information in their hands and draw accurate conclusions from it [34]. In the scenario we consider, once an individual provides personal information to other parties, she literally loses control of that information. That loss of control propagates through other parties and persists for unpredictable spans of time. Being in a position of information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she is transacting, decisions must be based on stochastic assessments, and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect the individual become very difficult to aggregate, calculate, and compare.2 Bounded rationality will affect the calculation of the parameters in Equation 1, and in particular δ, γ, vE(), and pt(). The cognitive costs involved in trying to calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that the individual may just resort to simple heuristics. 3. Psychological distortions. Eventually, even if an individual had access to complete information and could appropriately compute it, she still may find it difficult to follow the rational strategy presented in Equation 1. A vast body of economic and psychological literature has by now confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological distortions on individual decision making. Privacy seems to be a case study encompassing many of those distortions: hyperbolic discounting, under insurance, self-control problems, immediate gratification, and others. The traditional dichotomy between attitude and behavior, observed in several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social psychology literature since [24] and [13], may also appear in the privacy space because of these distortions. For example, individuals have a tendency to discount hyperbolically future costs or benefits [31, 27]. In economics, hyperbolic discounting implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events. Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22]. In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead. People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences. Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable. For example, a small and apparently innocuous piece of information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous liability in the right context. 3 A more rigorous description and application of hyperbolic discounting is provided in Section 4. In addition, individuals suffer from optimism bias [42], the misperception that ones risks are lower than those of other individuals under similar conditions. Optimism bias may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy intrusions. Individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with cumulative risks. [35], for instance, shows that while young smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking, they do not fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a serious danger. Difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks apply to privacy, because our personal information, once released, can remain available over long periods of time. And since it can be correlated to other data, the anonymity sets [32, 14] in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller. As a result, the whole risk associated with revealing different pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the individual risks associated with each piece of data. Also, it is easier to deal with actions and effects that are closer to us in time. Actions and effects that are in the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited foresight perspective. As the foresight changes, so does behavior, even when preferences remain the same [20]. This phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions, since the costs of privacy protection may be immediate, but the rewards may be invisible (absence of intrusions) and spread over future periods of time. To summarize: whenever we face privacy sensitive decisions, we hardly have all data necessary for an informed choice. But even if we had, we would be likely unable to process it. And even if we could process it, we may still end behaving against our own better judgment. In what follows, we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based on some of these findings, and in particular on the plight of immediate gratification. 4. PRIVACY AND THE ECONOMICS OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by ODonoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A persons relative preference for wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their long-run selves do not appreciate. For example, if you were given only two alternatives, on Monday you may claim you will prefer working 5 hours on Saturday to 5 hours and half on Sunday. But as Saturday comes, you will be more likely to prefer postponing work until Sunday. This simple observation has rather important consequences in economic theory, where time-consistency of preferences is the dominant model. Consider first the traditional model of utility that agents derive from consumption: the model states that utility discounts exponentially over time: Ut = T τ=t δτ uτ (2) In Equation 2, the cumulative utility U at time t is the discounted sum of all utilities from time t (the present) until time T (the future). δ is the discount factor, with a value 24 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Benefits from selling period 1 2 0 0 0 Costs from selling period 1 0 1 1 1 Benefits from selling period 2 0 2 0 0 Costs from selling period 2 0 0 1 1 Benefits from selling period 3 0 0 2 0 Costs from selling period 3 0 0 0 1 Table 1: (Fictional) expected payoffs from joining loyalty program. between 0 and 1. A value of 0 would imply that the individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods is worth zero today. A value of 1 would imply that the individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities. The discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact that having (say) one dollar one year from now is valuable, but not as much as having that dollar now. In Equation 2, if all uτ were constant - for instance, 10 - and δ was 0.9, then at time t = 0 (that is, now) u0 would be worth 10, but u1 would be worth 9. Modifying the traditional model of utility discounting, [23] and then [31] have proposed a model which takes into account possible time-inconsistency of preferences. Consider Equation 3: Ut(ut, ut+1, ..., uT ) = δt ut + β T τ=t+1 δτ uτ (3) Assume that δ, β ∈ [0, 1]. δ is the discount factor for intertemporal utility as in Equation 2. β is the parameter that captures an individuals tendency to gratify herself immediately (a form of time-inconsistent preferences). When β is 1, the model maps the traditional time-consistent utility model, and Equation 3 is identical to Equation 2. But when β is zero, the individual does not care for anything but today. In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias. The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future. This analytical framework can be applied to the study of privacy attitudes and behavior. Protecting your privacy sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it represents something akin to getting an insurance against future and only uncertain risks. In surveys completed at time t = 0, subjects asked about their attitude towards privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting themselves at a later time t = s and compare those to the avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant future t = s + n. Their alternatives at survey time 0 are represented in Equation 4. min wrt x DU0 = β[(E(cs,p)δs x) + (E(cs+n,i)δs+n (1 − x))] (4) x is a dummy variable that can take values 0 or 1. It represents the individuals choice - which costs the individual opts to face: the expected cost of protecting herself at time s, E(cs,p) (in which case x = 1), or the expected costs of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s + n, E(cs+n,i). The individual is trying to minimize the disutility DU of these costs with respect to x. Because she discounts the two future events with the same discount factor (although at different times), for certain values of the parameters the individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is worthy. In particular, this will happen when: E(cs,p)δs < E(cs+n,i)δs+n (5) Now, consider what happens as the moment t = s comes. Now a real price should be paid in order to enjoy some form of protection (say, starting to encrypt all of your emails to protect yourself from future intrusions). Now the individual will perceive a different picture: min wrt x DUs = δE(cs,p)x + βE(cn,i)δn (1 − x)] (6) Note that nothing has changed in the equation (certainly not the individuals perceived risks) except time. If β (the parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems) is less than one, chances are that the individual now will actually choose not to protect herself. This will in fact happen when: δE(cs,p) > βE(cn,i)δn (7) Note that Disequalities 5 and 7 may be simultaneously met for certain β < 1. At survey time the individual honestly claimed she wanted to protect herself in principlethat is, some time in the future. But as she is asked to make an effort to protect herself right now, she chooses to run the risk of privacy intrusion. Similar mathematical arguments can be made for the comparison between immediate costs with immediate benefits (subscribing to a no-call list to stop telemarketers from harassing you at dinner), and immediate costs with only future expected rewards (insuring yourself against identity theft, or protecting yourself from frauds by never using your credit card on-line), particularly when expected future rewards (or avoided risks) are also intangible: the immaterial consequences of living (or not) in a dossier society, or the chilling effects (or lack thereof) of being under surveillance. The reader will have noticed that we have focused on perceived (expected) costs E(c), rather than real costs. We do not know the real costs and we do not claim that the 25 individual does. But we are able to show that under certain conditions even costs perceived as very high (as during periods of intense privacy debate) will be ignored. We can provide some fictional numerical examples to make the analysis more concrete. We present some scenarios inspired by the calculations in [31]. Imagine an economy with just 4 periods (Table 1). Each individual can enroll in a supermarkets loyalty program by revealing personal information. If she does so, the individual gets a discount of 2 during the period of enrollment, only to pay one unit each time thereafter because of price discrimination based on the information she revealed (we make no attempt at calibrating the realism of this obviously abstract example; the point we are focusing on is how time inconsistencies may affect individual behavior given the expected costs and benefits of certain actions).4 Depending on which period the individual chooses for selling her data, we have the undiscounted payoffs represented in Table 1. Imagine that the individual is contemplating these options and discounting them according to Equation 3. Suppose that δ = 1 for all types of individuals (this means that for simplicity we do not consider intertemporal discounting) but β = 1/2 for time-inconsistent individuals and β = 1 for everybody else. The time-consistent individual will choose to join the program at the very last period and rip off a benefit of 2-1=1. The individual with immediate gratification problems, for whom β = 1/2, will instead perceive the benefits from joining now or in period 3 as equivalent (0.5), and will join the program now, thus actually making herself worse off. [31] also suggest that, in addition to the distinction between time-consistent individuals and individuals with timeinconsistent preferences, we should also distinguish timeinconsistent individuals who are na¨ıve from those who are sophisticated. Na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals are not aware of their self-control problems - for example, they are those who always plan to start a diet next week. Sophisticated time-inconsistent individuals suffer of immediate gratification bias, but are at least aware of their inconsistencies. People in this category choose their behavior today correctly estimating their future time-inconsistent behavior. Now consider how this difference affects decisions in another scenario, represented in Table 2. An individual is considering the adoption of a certain privacy enhancing technology. It will cost her some money both to protect herself and not to protect herself. If she decides to protect herself, the cost will be the amount she pays - for example - for some technology that shields her personal information. If she decides not to protect herself, the cost will be the expected consequences of privacy intrusions. We assume that both these aggregate costs increase over time, although because of separate dynamics. As time goes by, more and more information about the individual has been revealed, and it becomes more costly to be protected against privacy intrusions. At the same time, however, intrusions become more frequent and dangerous. 4 One may claim that loyalty cards keep on providing benefits over time. Here we make the simplifying assumption that such benefits are not larger than the future costs incurred after having revealed ones tastes. We also assume that the economy ends in period 4 for all individuals, regardless of when they chose to join the loyalty program. In period 1, the individual may protect herself by spending 5, or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the following period, expected to cost 7. In the second period, assuming that no intrusion has yet taken place, she may once again protect herself by spending a little more, 6; or she may choose to face a risk of privacy intrusion the next (third) period, expected to cost 9. In the third period she could protect herself for 8 or face an expected cost of 15 in the following last period. Here too we make no attempt at calibrating the values in Table 2. Again, we focus on the different behavior driven by heterogeneity in time-consistency and sophistication versus na¨ıvete. We assume that β = 1 for individuals with no self control problems and β = 1/2 for everybody else. We assume for simplicity that δ = 1 for all. The time-consistent individuals will obviously choose to protect themselves as soon as possible. In the first period, na¨ıve time-inconsistent individuals will compare the costs of protecting themselves then or face a privacy intrusion in the second period. Because 5 > 7 ∗ (1/2), they will prefer to wait until the following period to protect themselves. But in the second period they will be comparing 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2) - and so they will postpone their protection again. They will keep on doing so, facing higher and higher risks. Eventually, they will risk to incur the highest perceived costs of privacy intrusions (note again that we are simply assuming that individuals believe there are privacy risks and that they increase over time; we will come back to this concept later on). Time-inconsistent but sophisticated individuals, on the other side, will adopt a protective technology in period 2 and pay 6. By period 2, in fact, they will (correctly) realize that if they wait till period 3 (which they are tempted to do, because 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2)), their self-control bias will lead them to postpone adopting the technology once more (because 8 > 15 ∗ (1/2)). Therefore they predict they would incur the expected cost 15 ∗ (1/2), which is larger than 6the cost of protecting oneself in period 2. In period 1, however, they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect themselves further than period 2. So they wait till period 2, because 5 > 6 ∗ (1/2), at which time they will adopt a protective technology (see also [31]). To summarize, time-inconsistent people tend not to fully appreciate future risks and, if na¨ıve, also their inability to deal with them. This happens even if they are aware of those risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing. As we learnt from the second scenario, time inconsistency can lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks. Individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present low risks, but their repetition forms a huge liability: it is a deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly appreciated only after privacy itself is lost. This dynamics captures the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32, 14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. In addition, [31] show that when costs are immediate, time-inconsistent individuals tend to procrastinate; when benefits are immediate, they tend to preoperate. In our context things are even more interesting because all privacy decisions involve at the same time costs and benefits. So we opt against using eCash [9] in order to save us the costs of switching from credit cards. But we accept the risk that our credit card number on the Internet could be used ma26 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Protection costs 5 6 8 .

And we give away our personal information to supermarkets in order to gain immediate discounts - which will likely turn into price discrimination in due time [3, 26]. We have shown in the second scenario above how sophisticated but time-inconsistent individuals may choose to protect their information only in period 2. Sophisticated people with self-control problems may be at a loss, sometimes even when compared to na¨ıve people with time inconsistency problems (how many privacy advocates do use privacy enhancing technologies all the time?). The reasoning is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control problems, and rather than ignoring them, they incorporate them into their decision process. This may decrease their own incentive to behave in the optimal way now. Sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic, and so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to that, a form of coherent arbitrariness). This is consistent with the results by [36] presented at the ACM EC 01 conference. [36] found that privacy advocates were also willing to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary rewards. It is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about available technologies. Individuals in the abstract scenarios we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs. However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of those liabilities is almost irrelevant. The individual will take very slowly increasing risks, which become steps towards huge liabilities. 5. DISCUSSION Applying models of self-control bias and immediate gratification to the study of privacy decision making may offer a new perspective on the ongoing privacy debate. We have shown that a model of rational privacy behavior is unrealistic, while models based on psychological distortions offer a more accurate depiction of the decision process. We have shown why individuals who genuinely would like to protect their privacy may not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral economics literature. We have highlighted that these distortions may affect not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones. Surprisingly, we have also found that these inconsistencies may occur when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant. Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis. Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors. An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances). However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors. Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions. An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda. The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the privacy problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention. The conclusions we have reached suggest that individuals may not be trusted to make decisions in their best interests when it comes to privacy. This does not mean that privacy technologies are ineffective. On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of privacy enhancing tools. However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the privacy problem. Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help. However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed. Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons. A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]). Observing that people do not want to pay for privacy or do not care about privacy, therefore, is only a half truth. People may not be able to act as economically rational agents when it comes to personal privacy. And the question whether do consumers care? is a different question from does privacy matter? Whether from an economic standpoint privacy ought to be protected or not, is still an open question. It is a question that involves defining specific contexts in which the concept of privacy is being invoked. But the value of privacy eventually goes beyond the realms of economic reasoning and cost benefit analysis, and ends up relating to ones views on society and freedom. Still, even from a purely economic perspective, anecdotal evidence suggest that the costs of privacy (from spam to identity theft, lost sales, intrusions, and the like [30, 12, 17, 33, 26]) are high and increasing. 6.

John Heinz III Escuela de Políticas y Gestión Pública de Carnegie Mellon University Acquisti@andrew.cmu.edu Las dicotomías abstractas entre las actitudes y el comportamiento de la privacidad se han observado en la literatura, pero no aún no plenamenteexplicado. Aplicamos lecciones de la investigación sobre economía del comportamiento para comprender el proceso de toma de decisiones individual con respecto a la privacidad en el comercio electrónico. Mostramos que no es realista esperar la racionalidad individual en este contexto. Los modelos de problemas de autocontrol y la gratificación inmediata ofrecen descripciones más realistas del proceso de decisión y son más consistentes con los datos disponibles actualmente. En particular, mostramos por qué las personas que realmente pueden querer proteger su privacidad podrían no hacerlo debido a distorsiones psicológicas bien documentadas en la literatura conductual;Mostramos que estas distorsiones pueden afectar no solo a los individuos na¨ıve sino también a los sofisticados;Y demostramos que esto también puede ocurrir cuando las personas perciben los riesgos de no proteger su privacidad como significativa. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Ciencias sociales y conductuales]: Economía;K.4.1 [Temas de política pública]: Privacidad Términos generales Economía, seguridad, factores humanos 1. La privacidad y la privacidad de comercio electrónico sigue siendo un tema importante para el comercio electrónico. Un estudio de PricewaterhouseCoopers en 2000 mostró que casi dos tercios de los consumidores encuestados comprarían más en línea si supieran que los sitios minoristas no harían nada con su información personal [15]. Un estudio de la Comisión Federal de Comercio informó en 2000 que el sesenta y siete por ciento de los consumidores estaban muy preocupados por la privacidad de la información personal proporcionada en línea [11]. Más recientemente, una encuesta interactiva de Harris Harris en febrero de 2002 encontró que las tres mayores preocupaciones de los consumidores en el área de seguridad de la información personal en línea fueron: las empresas que comerciaban con datos personales sin permiso, las consecuencias de las transacciones inseguras y el robo de datos personales [19]. Según un estudio de investigación de Júpiter en 2002, se perderán $ 24.5 mil millones en ventas en línea en 2006, frente a $ 5.5 mil millones en 2001. Las ventas minoristas en línea serían aproximadamente un veinticuatro por ciento más altas en 2006 si los consumidores temen que la privacidad y la seguridad se abordara de manera efectiva [21]. Aunque la exageración de los medios ha disminuido un poco, los riesgos y los costos han evidenciados por los crecientes volúmenes de spam electrónico y robo de identidad [16]. Sin embargo, las encuestas en este campo, así como los experimentos y la evidencia anecdótica, también han pintado una imagen diferente.[36, 10, 18, 21] han encontrado evidencia de que incluso la privacidad se trata de las personas que están dispuestas a intercambiar la privacidad por conveniencia, o negociar la divulgación de información muy personal a cambio de recompensas relativamente pequeñas. El fracaso de varios servicios en línea destinado a proporcionar anonimato a los usuarios de Internet [6] ofrece evidencia indirecta adicional de la reticencia por parte de la mayoría de las personas a gastar cualquier esfuerzo en proteger su información personal. La dicotomía entre las actitudes de privacidad y el comportamiento se ha destacado en la literatura. Se han proporcionado interpretaciones preliminares de este fenómeno [2, 38, 33, 40]. Todavía faltan: una explicación basada en teorías económicas o psicológicas;una validación empírica de la explicación propuesta;Y, por supuesto, la respuesta a la pregunta más recurrente: ¿la gente debería molestarse en la privacidad? En este artículo nos centramos en la primera pregunta: analizamos formalmente el proceso de toma de decisiones individual con respecto a la privacidad y sus posibles deficiencias. Nos centramos en las concepciones individuales (MIS) sobre su manejo de riesgos que enfrentan al revelar información privada. No abordamos la cuestión de si las personas deberían protegerse realmente. Lo comentaremos sobre eso en la Sección 5, donde también discutiremos estrategias para validar empíricamente nuestra teoría. Aplicamos lecciones de la economía del comportamiento. La economía tradicional postula que las personas son actualizadoras con visión de futuro y bayesianas: tienen en cuenta cómo el comportamiento actual influirá en su futuro bienestar y preferencias. Por ejemplo, [5] estudian modelos racionales de adicción. Este enfoque se puede comparar con aquellos que ven en la decisión 21 para no proteger la privacidad de una elección racional dada los (supuestamente) bajos riesgos en juego. Sin embargo, los desarrollos en el área de la economía del comportamiento han destacado varias formas de inconsistencias psicológicas (problemas de autocontrol, descuento hiperbólico, sesgos presentes, etc.) que chocan con la visión completamente racional del agente económico. En este artículo, sacamos de estos desarrollos para llegar a las siguientes conclusiones: • Mostramos que es poco probable que las personas puedan actuar racionalmente en el sentido económico cuando se enfrentan a las decisiones sensibles a la privacidad.• Mostramos que los modelos alternativos de comportamiento personal y las preferencias incorporadas en el tiempo son compatibles con la dicotomía entre las actitudes y el comportamiento y pueden igualar mejor los datos actuales. Por ejemplo, pueden explicar los resultados presentados por [36] en la conferencia ACM EC 01. En su experimento, se descubrió que los defensores de la privacidad autoproclamados estaban dispuestos a revelar cantidades variables de información personal a cambio de pequeñas recompensas.• En particular, mostramos que los individuos pueden tener una tendencia a subprotigirse contra los riesgos de privacidad que perciben, y generar sobre la información personal, incluso cuando desconfían de los riesgos (percibidos) involucrados.• Mostramos que la magnitud de los costos percibidos de privacidad bajo ciertas condiciones no actuará como elemento disuasorio contra el comportamiento que el individuo admite es riesgoso.• Mostramos, siguiendo estudios similares en la economía de la gratificación inmediata [31], que incluso las personas sofisticadas pueden bajo ciertas condiciones miopes de privacidad. Nuestra conclusión es que simplemente proporcionar más información y conciencia en un entorno autorregulador no es suficiente para proteger la privacidad individual. Las tecnologías mejoradas, al reducir los costos de adopción y protección, ciertamente pueden ayudar. Sin embargo, las respuestas de comportamiento humano más fundamentales también deben abordarse si la privacidad debe protegerse. En la siguiente sección proponemos un modelo de agentes racionales que enfrentan decisiones sensibles a la privacidad. En la Sección 3 mostramos las dificultades que obstaculizan cualquier modelo de toma de decisiones de privacidad en función de la racionalidad completa. En la Sección 4, mostramos cómo los modelos de comportamiento basados en el sesgo inmediato de gratificación pueden explicar mejor las actitudes de dicotomía y los datos disponibles. En la Sección 5 resumimos y discutimos nuestras conclusiones.2. Un modelo de racionalidad en la toma de decisiones de privacidad algunos han utilizado la dicotomía entre las actitudes de privacidad y el comportamiento para afirmar que las personas actúan racionalmente cuando se trata de privacidad. Bajo este punto de vista, las personas pueden aceptar pequeñas recompensas por regalar información porque esperan que los daños futuros sean aún más pequeños (cuando se descuentan con el tiempo y con su probabilidad de ocurrencia). Aquí queremos investigar qué suposiciones subyacentes sobre el comportamiento personal apoyarían la hipótesis de la plena racionalidad en la toma de decisiones de privacidad. Desde [28, 37, 29] los economistas han estado interesados en la privacidad, pero solo recientemente los modelos formales han comenzado a aparecer [3, 7, 39, 40]. Si bien estos estudios se centran en las interacciones del mercado entre un agente y otras partes, aquí estamos interesados en formalizar el proceso de decisión del individuo. Queremos ver si las personas pueden ser económicamente racionales (vigilantes, actualizadores bayesianos, maximizadores de servicios públicos, etc.) cuando se trata de proteger su propia información personal. El concepto de privacidad, una vez pretendido como el derecho a quedarse solo [41], se ha transformado a medida que nuestra sociedad se ha orientado más a la información. En una sociedad de la información, el yo se expresa, define y se ve afectado a través de la información y la tecnología de la información. Los límites entre privado y público se vuelven borrosos. Por lo tanto, la privacidad se ha convertido en una clase más de intereses multifacéticos que un concepto único e inequívoco. Por lo tanto, su valor puede discutirse (si no se determina) solo una vez que su contexto también se haya especificado. Esto a menudo requiere el estudio de una red de relaciones entre un sujeto, cierta información (relacionada con el sujeto), otras partes (que pueden tener varios vínculos de interés o asociación con esa información o ese sujeto), y el contexto en el que tales como talesLos enlaces tienen lugar. Para comprender cómo un agente racional podría navegar a través de esas relaciones complejas, en la Ecuación 1 abstrae el proceso de decisión de un agente económico racional idealizado que enfrenta compensaciones de privacidad al completar una cierta transacción.max d ut = Δ ve (a), pd (a) + γ ve (t), pd (t) - cd t (1) en la ecuación 1, δ y γ son formas funcionales no especificadas que describen las relaciones ponderadas entre los pagos esperados deUn conjunto de eventos V y las probabilidades asociadas de ocurrencia de esos eventos p.Más precisamente, la utilidad U de completar una transacción t (la transacción es cualquier acción, no necesariamente una operación monetaria, que posiblemente implica la exposición de información personal) es igual a alguna función de la recompensa esperada ve (a) para mantener (o no)cierta información privada durante esa transacción, y la probabilidad de mantener [o no mantener] esa información privada al usar la tecnología d, Pd (a) [1 - Pd (a)];Además, alguna función del pago esperado (t) desde completar (o no completar) la transacción (posiblemente revelando información personal) y la probabilidad de completar [o no completar] esa transacción con una determinada tecnología D, PD (t) [1 - pd (t)];menos el costo de usar la tecnología T: CD T .1 La tecnología d puede o no mejorar la privacidad. Dado que los pagos en la ecuación 1 pueden ser positivos o negativos, la ecuación 1 incorpora la dualidad implícita en los problemas de privacidad: hay costos y beneficios obtenidos de revelar o proteger la información personal, y los costos y beneficios de completar una transacción, VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (VE (t), puede ser distinto de los costos y beneficios de mantener la información asociada privada, VE (a). Por ejemplo, revelar la identidad de una librería en línea puede ganar un descuento. Viceversa, también puede costar una factura más grande, debido a la discriminación de precios. Proteger la privacidad financiera al no divulgar la información de la tarjeta de crédito en línea puede proteger contra futuras pérdidas y problemas relacionados con el robo de identidad. Pero es 1 de ver también [1].22 Hacer que la experiencia de compra en línea sea más engorrosa y, por lo tanto, más cara. Los parámetros funcionales δ y γ encarnan los pesos y actitudes variables que un individuo puede tener para mantener su información privada (por ejemplo, su sensibilidad de la privacidad, o su creencia de que la privacidad es un derecho cuyo respeto debe ser aplicado por el gobierno) y completar ciertas transacciones. Tenga en cuenta que VE y P podrían referirse a conjuntos de pagos y las probabilidades asociadas de ocurrencia. Los pagos solo se esperan porque, independientemente de la probabilidad de que la transacción se complete o que la información permanezca privada, pueden depender de otros conjuntos de eventos y sus probabilidades asociadas.Ve () y Pd (), en otras palabras, se pueden leer como parámetros de variabilidades múltiples dentro de los cuales están ocultos varias otras variables, expectativas y funciones debido a la complejidad de la red de privacidad descrita anteriormente. Con el tiempo, la probabilidad de mantener cierta información en privado, por ejemplo, no solo dependerá de la tecnología elegida D sino también de los esfuerzos de otras partes para apropiarse de esa información. Estos esfuerzos pueden ser la función, entre otras cosas, del valor esperado de esa información a esas partes. La probabilidad de mantener la información privada también dependerá del entorno en el que se realiza la transacción. Del mismo modo, el beneficio esperado de mantener la información privada también será una recopilación en el tiempo de distribuciones de probabilidad que dependen de varios parámetros. Imagine que la probabilidad de mantener sus transacciones financieras en privado es muy alta cuando usa un banco en Bermudas: aún así, el valor esperado de mantener su información financiera confidencial dependerá de otros factores. Un agente racional, en teoría, elegiría la tecnología D que maximiza su recompensa esperada en la Ecuación 1. Tal vez ella elegiría completar la transacción bajo la protección de una tecnología que mejora la privacidad. Tal vez ella completaría la transacción sin protección. Tal vez ella no completaría la transacción en absoluto (d = 0). Por ejemplo, el agente puede considerar los costos y beneficios de enviar un correo electrónico a través de un sistema anónimo de red de mezcla [8] y compararlos con los costos y beneficios de enviar ese correo electrónico a través de un canal convencional y no anónimo. Las magnitudes de los parámetros en la Ecuación 1 cambiarán con la tecnología elegida. Los sistemas de redes de mezcla pueden disminuir las pérdidas esperadas de las intrusiones de privacidad. Los sistemas de correo electrónico no anónimos pueden prometer una confiabilidad comparablemente mayor y (posiblemente) costos reducidos de operaciones.3. La racionalidad y las distorsiones psicológicas en la ecuación de privacidad 1 es un mapa de carretera integral (aunque intencionalmente genérico) para la navegación a través de compensaciones de privacidad que ningún agente humano realmente podría usar. Insinimos algunas dificultades, ya que señalamos que varias capas de complejidades están ocultas dentro de los conceptos, como el valor esperado de mantener cierta información privada, y la probabilidad de tener éxito hacerlo. Más precisamente, un agente enfrentará tres problemas al comparar las compensaciones implícitas en la ecuación 1: información incompleta sobre todos los parámetros;potencia limitada para procesar toda la información disponible;No hay desviación del camino racional hacia la utilidad la maximización. Esos tres problemas son precisamente los mismos problemas con los que las personas reales tienen que enfrentar todos los días, ya que enfrentan decisiones sensibles a la privacidad. Discutimos cada problema en detalle.1. Información incompleta. ¿A qué información tiene acceso individual a medida que se prepara para tomar decisiones sensibles a la privacidad? Por ejemplo, ¿es consciente de las invasiones de privacidad y los riesgos asociados? ¿Cuál es su conocimiento de la existencia y las características de las tecnologías protectoras? Las transacciones económicas a menudo se caracterizan por información incompleta o asimétrica. Las diferentes partes involucradas pueden no tener la misma cantidad de información sobre la transacción y pueden ser inciertas sobre algunos aspectos importantes de la misma [4]. La información incompleta afectará a casi todos los parámetros en la Ecuación 1, y en particular la estimación de costos y beneficios. Los costos y los beneficios asociados con las intrusiones de protección de la privacidad y privacidad son monetarios e irrelevantes. Los costos monetarios pueden incluir, por ejemplo, los costos de adopción (que probablemente sean fijos) y los costos de uso (que son variables) de las tecnologías de protección, si el individuo decide protegerse. O pueden incluir los costos financieros asociados al robo de identidad, si la información de los individuos resulta no haber sido protegido adecuadamente. Los costos inmateriales pueden incluir los costos de aprendizaje de una tecnología de protección, cambiar los costos entre diferentes aplicaciones o estigma social al usar tecnologías de anonimización y muchas otras. Del mismo modo, los beneficios de proteger (o no proteger) la información personal también puede ser fácil de cuantificar en términos monetarios (el descuento que recibe para revelar datos personales) o ser intangible (la sensación de protección cuando envía correos electrónicos cifrados). Es difícil para un individuo estimar todos estos valores. A través de la tecnología de la información, las invasiones de privacidad pueden ser ubicuas e invisibles. Muchos de los pagos asociados con la protección de la privacidad o la intrusión pueden descubrirse o determinarse solo ex post a través de la experiencia real. Considere, por ejemplo, las dificultades para usar tecnologías de privacidad y encriptación descritas en [43]. Además, los cálculos implícitos en la Ecuación 1 dependen de información incompleta sobre la distribución de probabilidad de eventos futuros. Algunas de esas distribuciones pueden predecirse después de datos comparables, por ejemplo, la probabilidad de que una cierta transacción de la tarjeta de crédito resulte en fraude hoy en día podría calcularse utilizando estadísticas existentes. Las distribuciones de probabilidad de otros eventos pueden ser muy difíciles de estimar porque el entorno es demasiado dinámico para el ejemplo, la probabilidad de estar sujeta al robo de identidad 5 años en el futuro debido a ciertos datos que está liberando ahora. Y las distribuciones de otros eventos pueden ser casi completamente subjetivas, por ejemplo, la probabilidad de que una forma nueva y práctica de ataque a un criptosistema actualmente seguro exponga todas sus comunicaciones personales cifradas dentro de unos años. Esto lleva a un problema relacionado: racionalidad limitada.2. Racionalidad limitada. ¿El individuo es capaz de calcular todos los parámetros relevantes para su elección? ¿O está limitada por la racionalidad limitada? En nuestro contexto, la racionalidad limitada se refiere a la incapacidad de calcular y comparar las magnitudes de los pagos asociadas con varias estrategias que el individuo puede elegir en situaciones sensibles a la privacidad. También se refiere a la incapacidad de procesar toda la información estocástica relacionada con los riesgos y probabilidades de los eventos que conducen a los costos y beneficios de privacidad.23 En la teoría económica tradicional, se supone que el agente tiene racionalidad y poder computacional ilimitado para procesar información. Pero los agentes humanos no pueden procesar toda la información en sus manos y sacar conclusiones precisas de ella [34]. En el escenario que consideramos, una vez que un individuo proporciona información personal a otras partes, literalmente pierde el control de esa información. Esa pérdida de control se propaga a través de otras partes y persiste por tramos de tiempo impredecibles. Al estar en una posición de asimetría de información con respecto a la parte con la que está realizando transacciones, las decisiones deben basarse en evaluaciones estocásticas, y las magnitudes de los factores que pueden afectar al individuo se vuelven muy difíciles de agregar, calcular y comparar.2 Limitados.La racionalidad afectará el cálculo de los parámetros en la Ecuación 1, y en particular δ, γ, Ve () y Pt (). Por lo tanto, los costos cognitivos involucrados en tratar de calcular la mejor estrategia podrían ser tan altos que el individuo puede recurrir a la heurística simple.3. Distorsiones psicológicas. Finalmente, incluso si un individuo tuviera acceso a información completa y pudiera calcularla adecuadamente, aún puede tener dificultades para seguir la estrategia racional presentada en la Ecuación 1. Un vasto cuerpo de literatura económica y psicológica ya ha confirmado el impacto de varias formas de distorsiones psicológicas en la toma de decisiones individuales. La privacidad parece ser un estudio de caso que abarca muchas de esas distorsiones: descuento hiperbólico, bajo seguro, problemas de autocontrol, gratificación inmediata y otros. La dicotomía tradicional entre actitud y comportamiento, observada en varios aspectos de la psicología humana y estudiada en la literatura de psicología social desde [24] y [13], también puede aparecer en el espacio de la privacidad debido a estas distorsiones. Por ejemplo, los individuos tienden a descontar hiperbólicamente los costos o beneficios futuros [31, 27]. En economía, el descuento hiperbólico implica una inconsistencia de las preferencias personales a lo largo del tiempo: los eventos futuros pueden descartarse a diferentes tasas de descuento que los eventos a corto plazo. El descuento hiperbólico puede afectar las decisiones de privacidad, por ejemplo, cuando descartamos en gran medida la probabilidad (baja) de (altos) riesgos futuros, como el robo de identidad.3 relacionado con el descuento hiperbólico es la tendencia a subestimar a ciertos riesgos [22]. En general, los individuos pueden poner limitaciones en el comportamiento futuro que limitan su propio logro de la utilidad máxima: las personas realmente pueden querer protegerse, pero debido al sesgo de autocontrol, en realidad no tomarán esos pasos y optarán por una satisfacción inmediata. Las personas tienden a subestimar los efectos de los cambios en sus estados y, por lo tanto, proyectan falsamente sus preferencias actuales sobre el consumo en sus preferencias futuras. Mucho más que sugerir simplemente que las personas predicen mal sabores futuros, este sesgo de proyección plantea un patrón sistemático en estas predicciones erróneas que pueden conducir a errores sistemáticos en entornos dinámicos de choice [25, p.2].2 La utilidad negativa que proviene de futuros mal uso de información personal de SomeBodys podría ser un shock aleatorio cuya probabilidad y alcance son extremadamente variables. Por ejemplo, una información pequeña y aparentemente inocua podría convertirse en un activo crucial o un pasivo peligroso en el contexto correcto.3 Una descripción más rigurosa y la aplicación de descuento hiperbólico se proporciona en la Sección 4. Además, los individuos sufren de sesgo de optimismo [42], la percepción errónea de que los riesgos son más bajos que los de otros individuos en condiciones similares. El sesgo de optimismo puede hacernos creer que no estaremos sujetos a intrusiones de privacidad. Las personas se encuentran con dificultades cuando se trata de riesgos acumulativos.[35], por ejemplo, muestra que, si bien los jóvenes fumadores aprecian los riesgos a largo plazo de fumar, no se dan cuenta de la relación acumulativa entre los bajos riesgos de cada cigarrillo adicional y la lenta construcción de un peligro grave. Las dificultades para tratar los riesgos acumulativos se aplican a la privacidad, porque nuestra información personal, una vez publicada, puede permanecer disponible durante largos períodos de tiempo. Y dado que se puede correlacionar con otros datos, los establecimientos de anonimato [32, 14] en los que deseamos permanecer ocultos se hacen más pequeños. Como resultado, todo el riesgo asociado con la revelación de diferentes piezas de información personal es más que la suma de los riesgos individuales asociados con cada pieza de datos. Además, es más fácil lidiar con acciones y efectos que están más cerca de nosotros a tiempo. Las acciones y los efectos que están en el futuro lejano son difíciles de enfocar dada nuestra perspectiva de previsión limitada. A medida que cambia la previsión, también lo hace el comportamiento, incluso cuando las preferencias siguen siendo las mismas [20]. Este fenómeno también puede afectar las decisiones de privacidad, ya que los costos de la protección de la privacidad pueden ser inmediatos, pero las recompensas pueden ser invisibles (ausencia de intrusiones) y distribuidos durante los períodos futuros de tiempo. Para resumir: cada vez que enfrentamos decisiones sensibles a la privacidad, apenas tenemos todos los datos necesarios para una elección informada. Pero incluso si lo hubiéramos tenido, probablemente no podamos procesarlo. E incluso si pudiéramos procesarlo, aún podemos terminar con el comportamiento de nuestro propio juicio. En lo que sigue, presentamos un modelo de actitudes de privacidad y comportamiento basados en algunos de estos hallazgos, y en particular en la difícil situación de la satisfacción inmediata.4. La privacidad y la economía de la gratificación inmediata El problema de la satisfacción inmediata (que está relacionada con los conceptos de inconsistencia del tiempo, descuento hiperbólico y sesgo de autocontrol) se describe así por Odonoghue y Rabin [27, p.4]: una preferencia relativa de personas por el bienestar en una fecha anterior sobre una fecha posterior se vuelve más fuerte a medida que la fecha anterior se acerca.[...] [P] eople tiene problemas de autocontrol causados por una tendencia a perseguir la gratificación inmediata de una manera que sus seres a largo plazo no aprecian. Por ejemplo, si se le dieron solo dos alternativas, el lunes puede afirmar que preferirá trabajar 5 horas el sábado a 5 horas y la mitad el domingo. Pero a medida que llegue el sábado, es más probable que prefiera posponer el trabajo hasta el domingo. Esta simple observación tiene consecuencias bastante importantes en la teoría económica, donde la consistencia de las preferencias es el modelo dominante. Considere primero el modelo tradicional de utilidad que los agentes derivan del consumo: el modelo establece que los descuentos de utilidad exponencialmente con el tiempo: ut = t τ = t Δτ uτ (2) En la ecuación 2, la utilidad acumulativa u en el momento t es la suma descontada detodas las utilidades desde el tiempo t (el presente) hasta el tiempo t (el futuro).δ es el factor de descuento, con un valor 24 período 1 período 2 período 3 Período 4 Beneficios de la venta Período 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 Costos del período de venta 1 0 1 1 1 Beneficios del período de venta 2 0 2 0 0 Costos del período de venta 20 0 1 1 Beneficios del período de venta 3 0 0 0 2 0 Costos del período de venta 3 0 0 0 1 Tabla 1: (Ficcional) Los pagos esperados se unen al Programa de Lealtad.entre 0 y 1. Un valor de 0 implicaría que los descuentos individuales tanto que la utilidad de los períodos futuros vale cero hoy. Un valor de 1 implicaría que el individuo es tan paciente que no descarta futuras empresas de servicios públicos. El factor de descuento se usa en economía para capturar el hecho de que tener (digamos) un dólar dentro de un año es valioso, pero no tanto como tener ese dólar ahora. En la ecuación 2, si todos los uτ fueran constantes, por ejemplo, 10, y δ era 0.9, entonces en el tiempo t = 0 (es decir, ahora) U0 valdría 10, pero U1 valdría 9. La modificación del modelo tradicional de descuento de servicios públicos, [23] y luego [31] han propuesto un modelo que tiene en cuenta la posible incrustación de tiempo de las preferencias. Considere la ecuación 3: UT (UT, UT+1, ..., UT) = ΔT UT+β T τ = T+1 Δτ uτ (3) suponga que δ, β ∈ [0, 1].δ es el factor de descuento para la utilidad intertemporal como en la ecuación 2. β es el parámetro que captura una tendencia individual a gratificarse de inmediato (una forma de preferencias incorporadas en el tiempo). Cuando β es 1, el modelo asigna el modelo de utilidad tradicional consistente en el tiempo, y la ecuación 3 es idéntica a la ecuación 2. Pero cuando β es cero, al individuo no le importa nada más que hoy. De hecho, cualquier β menor que 1 representa un sesgo de autocontrol. La literatura experimental ha demostrado convincentemente que los seres humanos tienden a tener problemas de autocontrol incluso cuando afirman lo contrario: tendemos a evitar y posponer actividades indeseables incluso cuando esto implicará más esfuerzo mañana;Y tendemos a participar demasiado en actividades agradables, aunque esto puede causar sufrimiento o una utilidad reducida en el futuro. Este marco analítico se puede aplicar al estudio de las actitudes y el comportamiento de la privacidad. Proteger su privacidad a veces significa protegerse de una molestia clara y presente (telemarketers o personas que asoman a través de su ventana y ver cómo vive, vea [33]);Pero a veces representa algo similar a obtener un seguro contra el futuro y solo los riesgos inciertos. En las encuestas completadas en el momento t = 0, los sujetos preguntaron sobre su actitud hacia los riesgos de privacidad pueden considerar mentalmente algunos costos de protegerse en un momento posterior T = S y compararlos con los costos evitados de las intrusiones de privacidad en un futuro aún más distante T =s + n.Sus alternativas en el tiempo de encuesta 0 se representan en la ecuación 4. Min WRT x du0 = β [(E (CS, P) ΔS x)+(E (CS+N, I) ΔS+N (1 - X))] (4) X es una variable ficticia que puede tomar valores 0 o 1. Representa la opción de individuos, que cuesta a las opciones individuales a enfrentar: el costo esperado de protegerse en el momento S, E (CS, P) (en cuyo caso x = 1), o los costos esperados de estar sujeto a intrusiones de privacidadUn tiempo posterior S + N, E (CS + N, I). El individuo está tratando de minimizar la desutilidad du de estos costos con respecto a x. Debido a que ella descuenta los dos eventos futuros con el mismo factor de descuento (aunque en diferentes momentos), para ciertos valores de los parámetros, el individuo puede concluir que pagar para protegerse es digno. En particular, esto sucederá cuando: E (CS, P) ΔS <E (CS+N, I) ΔS+N (5) Ahora, considere lo que sucede como el momento T = S viene. Ahora se debe pagar un precio real para disfrutar de alguna forma de protección (por ejemplo, comenzar a cifrar todos sus correos electrónicos para protegerse de futuras intrusiones). Ahora el individuo percibirá una imagen diferente: min wrt x dus = Δe (cs, p) x + βe (cn, i) Δn (1 - x)] (6) Tenga en cuenta que nada ha cambiado en la ecuación (ciertamente no elRiesgos percibidos de las personas) excepto el tiempo. Si β (el parámetro que indica el grado de problemas de autocontrol) es menor que uno, es probable que el individuo ahora elija no protegerse. De hecho, esto sucederá cuando: ΔE (CS, P)> βE (CN, I) ΔN (7) Tenga en cuenta que las desequilibidades 5 y 7 pueden cumplirse simultáneamente para ciertos β <1. En el momento de la encuesta, la persona afirmó honestamente que quería protegerse en principios, en algún momento en el futuro. Pero como se le pide que haga un esfuerzo para protegerse en este momento, elige correr el riesgo de intrusión de privacidad. Se pueden hacer argumentos matemáticos similares para la comparación entre los costos inmediatos con beneficios inmediatos (suscribirse a una lista de no llamar para evitar que los telemarketers lo acosen en la cena), y los costos inmediatos con solo futuras recompensas esperadas (asegurándose contra el robo de identidad, o proteger o protegerusted mismo de fraudes al nunca usar su tarjeta de crédito en línea), particularmente cuando las recompensas futuras esperadas (o los riesgos evitados) también son intangibles: las consecuencias inmateriales de vivir (o no) en una sociedad de dossier, o los efectos escalofriantes (o la falta de ellos) de estar bajo vigilancia. El lector habrá notado que nos hemos centrado en los costos percibidos (esperados) E (C), en lugar de los costos reales. No conocemos los costos reales y no afirmamos que el individuo 25 lo haga. Pero podemos demostrar que bajo ciertas condiciones, incluso los costos percibidos como muy altos (como durante los períodos de intenso debate de privacidad) se ignorará. Podemos proporcionar algunos ejemplos numéricos ficticios para que el análisis sea más concreto. Presentamos algunos escenarios inspirados en los cálculos en [31]. Imagine una economía con solo 4 períodos (Tabla 1). Cada individuo puede inscribirse en un programa de fidelización de supermercados revelando información personal. Si lo hace, el individuo obtiene un descuento de 2 durante el período de inscripción, solo para pagar una unidad cada vez a partir de entonces debido a la discriminación de precios basada en la información que reveló (no intentamos calibrar el realismo de este ejemplo obviamente abstracto; El punto en el que nos estamos centrando es en cómo las inconsistencias del tiempo pueden afectar el comportamiento individual dados los costos y beneficios esperados de ciertas acciones) .4 Dependiendo del período en que el individuo elija para vender sus datos, tenemos los pagos no descontados representados en la Tabla 1. Imagine que el individuo está contemplando estas opciones y descartándolas de acuerdo con la Ecuación 3. Suponga que δ = 1 para todos los tipos de individuos (esto significa que para simplicidad no consideramos el descuento intertemporal) sino β = 1/2 para individuos incontables y β = 1 para todos los demás. El individuo consistente en el tiempo elegirá unirse al programa en el último período y estafa un beneficio de 2-1 = 1. El individuo con problemas de gratificación inmediatos, para los cuales β = 1/2, percibirá los beneficios de unirse ahora o en el período 3 como equivalente (0.5), y ahora se unirá al programa, así que realmente empeoró.[31] también sugieren que, además de la distinción entre individuos consistentes en el tiempo y individuos con preferencias de tiempo de tiempo, también debemos distinguir a las personas sin ingreso a tiempo que son náuticas de aquellos que están sofisticados. Las personas sin incipientes en el tiempo no son conscientes de sus problemas de autocontrol, por ejemplo, son aquellos que siempre planean comenzar una dieta la próxima semana. Las personas sofisticadas incorporadas en el tiempo sufren un sesgo inmediato de gratificación, pero al menos son conscientes de sus inconsistencias. Las personas en esta categoría eligen su comportamiento hoy estimando correctamente su futuro comportamiento incrustado en el tiempo. Ahora considere cómo esta diferencia afecta las decisiones en otro escenario, representada en la Tabla 2. Un individuo está considerando la adopción de una cierta tecnología de mejora de la privacidad. Le costará algo de dinero tanto protegerse como para no protegerse. Si decide protegerse, el costo será la cantidad que paga, por ejemplo, por una tecnología que protege su información personal. Si decide no protegerse, el costo será las consecuencias esperadas de las intrusiones de privacidad. Suponemos que ambos costos agregados aumentan con el tiempo, aunque debido a la dinámica separada. A medida que pasa el tiempo, se ha revelado cada vez más información sobre el individuo, y se vuelve más costoso protegerse contra las intrusiones de privacidad. Al mismo tiempo, sin embargo, las intrusiones se vuelven más frecuentes y peligrosas.4 Uno puede afirmar que las tarjetas de fidelización siguen proporcionando beneficios con el tiempo. Aquí hacemos la suposición simplificadora de que tales beneficios no son mayores que los costos futuros incurridos después de haber revelado los gustos. También suponemos que la economía termina en el período 4 para todas las personas, independientemente de cuándo eligieron unirse al programa de fidelización. En el período 1, la persona puede protegerse gastando 5, o puede optar por enfrentar un riesgo de intrusión de privacidad el siguiente período, que se espera que cueste 7. En el segundo período, suponiendo que aún no haya tenido lugar una intrusión, una vez más puede protegerse gastando un poco más, 6;O puede optar por enfrentar un riesgo de intrusión de privacidad en el próximo período (tercer), se espera que cueste 9. En el tercer período podría protegerse por 8 o enfrentar un costo esperado de 15 en el siguiente último período. Aquí también no intentamos calibrar los valores en la Tabla 2. Nuevamente, nos centramos en el comportamiento diferente impulsado por la heterogeneidad en la consistencia del tiempo y la sofisticación versus Na¨ıvete. Suponemos que β = 1 para individuos sin problemas de autocontrol y β = 1/2 para todos los demás. Asumimos por simplicidad que δ = 1 para todos. Las personas consistentes en el tiempo obviamente elegirán protegerse lo antes posible. En el primer período, las personas sin incipientes en el tiempo compararán los costos de protegerse o enfrentarán una intrusión de privacidad en el segundo período. Porque 5> 7 ∗ (1/2), preferirán esperar hasta el siguiente período para protegerse. Pero en el segundo período compararán 6> 9 ∗ (1/2), y así posponer su protección nuevamente. Seguirán haciéndolo, enfrentando riesgos cada vez mayores. Eventualmente, se arriesgarán a incurrir en los mayores costos percibidos de las intrusiones de privacidad (tenga en cuenta que simplemente estamos asumiendo que las personas creen que hay riesgos de privacidad y que aumentan con el tiempo; volveremos a este concepto más adelante). Los individuos incorporados en el tiempo pero sofisticados, por otro lado, adoptarán una tecnología de protección en el período 2 y pagarán 6. En el período 2, de hecho, (correctamente) se darán cuenta de que si esperan hasta el período 3 (que están tentados a hacer, porque 6> 9 ∗ (1/2)), su sesgo de autocontrol los llevará a posponerse aadoptando la tecnología una vez más (porque 8> 15 ∗ (1/2)). Por lo tanto, predicen que incurrirían en el costo esperado 15 ∗ (1/2), que es mayor que 6 el costo de protegerse en el período 2. Sin embargo, en el período 1, predicen correctamente que no esperarán para protegerse más allá del período 2. Entonces esperan hasta el período 2, porque 5> 6 ∗ (1/2), momento en el que adoptarán una tecnología de protección (ver también [31]). Para resumir, las personas incorporadas en el tiempo tienden a no apreciar completamente los riesgos futuros y, si Na¨ıve, también su incapacidad para lidiar con ellos. Esto sucede incluso si son conscientes de esos riesgos y son conscientes de que esos riesgos están aumentando. Como aprendimos del segundo escenario, la inconsistencia del tiempo puede llevar a las personas a aceptar riesgos más altos y mayores. Las personas pueden tender a minimizar el hecho de que las acciones individuales presentan bajos riesgos, pero su repetición forma una gran responsabilidad: es un aspecto engañoso de la privacidad que su valor realmente se aprecia solo después de que se pierde la privacidad en sí. Esta dinámica captura la esencia de la privacidad y los llamados conjuntos de anonimato [32, 14], donde cada bit de información que revelamos puede vincularse a los demás, de modo que el todo es más que la suma de las partes. Además, [31] muestran que cuando los costos son las personas inmediatas, incontables en el tiempo, tienden a postergar;Cuando los beneficios son inmediatos, tienden a preoperar. En nuestro contexto, las cosas son aún más interesantes porque todas las decisiones de privacidad implican al mismo tiempo costos y beneficios. Por lo tanto, optamos contra el uso de ECASH [9] para ahorrarnos los costos de cambiar de tarjetas de crédito. Pero aceptamos el riesgo de que nuestro número de tarjeta de crédito en Internet pueda usarse MA26 Período 1 Período 2 Período 3 Período 4 Costos de protección 5 6 8. Costos de intrusión esperados.7 9 15 Tabla 2: (ficticio) Costos de proteger la privacidad y los costos esperados de las intrusiones de privacidad con el tiempo.Licemente. Y regalamos nuestra información personal a los supermercados para obtener descuentos inmediatos, lo que probablemente convertirá en la discriminación de precios a su debido tiempo [3, 26]. Hemos demostrado en el segundo escenario por encima de cómo las personas sofisticadas pero incorporadas pueden elegir proteger su información solo en el período 2. Las personas sofisticadas con problemas de autocontrol pueden ser pérdidas, a veces incluso en comparación con las personas naentas con problemas de inconsistencia (¿cuántos defensores de la privacidad usan tecnologías que mejoran la privacidad todo el tiempo?). El razonamiento es que las personas sofisticadas son conscientes de sus problemas de autocontrol y, en lugar de ignorarlos, los incorporan a su proceso de decisión. Esto puede disminuir su propio incentivo para comportarse de la manera óptima ahora. Los defensores de la privacidad sofisticados pueden darse cuenta de que protegerse de cualquier posible intrusión de privacidad no es realista, por lo que pueden comenzar a comportarse mal ahora (y pueden acostumbrarse a eso, una forma de arbitrariedad coherente). Esto es consistente con los resultados de [36] presentados en la conferencia ACM EC 01.[36] descubrieron que los defensores de la privacidad también estaban dispuestos a revelar información personal a cambio de recompensas monetarias. También es interesante observar que estas inconsistencias no son causadas por la ignorancia de los riesgos existentes o la confusión sobre las tecnologías disponibles. Las personas en los escenarios abstractos que describimos son conscientes de sus riesgos y costos percibidos. Sin embargo, bajo ciertas condiciones, la magnitud de esos pasivos es casi irrelevante. El individuo tomará riesgos aumentados muy lentamente, lo que se convertirá en pasos hacia grandes pasivos.5. Discusión La aplicación de modelos de sesgo de autocontrol y gratificación inmediata al estudio de la toma de decisiones de privacidad puede ofrecer una nueva perspectiva sobre el debate continuo de privacidad. Hemos demostrado que un modelo de comportamiento de privacidad racional no es realista, mientras que los modelos basados en distorsiones psicológicas ofrecen una representación más precisa del proceso de decisión. Hemos demostrado por qué las personas que realmente desean proteger su privacidad pueden no hacerlo debido a distorsiones psicológicas bien documentadas en la literatura de economía conductual. Hemos destacado que estas distorsiones pueden afectar no solo a los individuos na¨ ven sino también a los sofisticados. Sorprendentemente, también hemos encontrado que estas inconsistencias pueden ocurrir cuando las personas perciben los riesgos de no proteger su privacidad como significativa. Las incertidumbres adicionales, la aversión al riesgo y las actitudes variables hacia las pérdidas y las ganancias pueden ser elementos confusos en nuestro análisis. La validación empírica es necesaria para calibrar los efectos de diferentes factores. Un análisis empírico puede comenzar con la comparación de los datos disponibles sobre la tasa de adopción de las tecnologías de privacidad que ofrecen refugio inmediato de preocupaciones de privacidad menores pero apremiantes (por ejemplo, no llaman listas de marketing), con datos sobre la adopción de tecnologías de privacidad que ofrecen menosObviamente, la protección percibible de los riesgos de privacidad más peligrosos pero también menos visibles (por ejemplo, seguros de robo de identidad). Sin embargo, solo un enfoque experimental durante diferentes períodos de tiempo en un entorno controlado puede permitirnos desenredar la influencia de varios factores. Las encuestas por sí solas no pueden ser suficientes, ya que hemos demostrado por qué las actitudes de tiempo de encuesta rara vez coincidirán con las acciones de tiempo de decisión. Una verificación experimental es parte de nuestra agenda de investigación en curso. Las distorsiones psicológicas que hemos discutido pueden considerarse en el debate en curso sobre cómo lidiar con el problema de la privacidad: autorregulación de la industria, autoestección de usuarios (a través de la tecnología u otras estrategias), o la intervención de los gobiernos. Las conclusiones que hemos llegado sugieren que no se puede confiar en las personas para tomar decisiones en sus mejores intereses cuando se trata de privacidad. Esto no significa que las tecnologías de privacidad sean ineficaces. Por el contrario, nuestros resultados, al apuntar a ofrecer un modelo más realista de comportamiento de usuario, podrían ser de ayuda para los tecnólogos en su diseño de herramientas de mejora de la privacidad. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados también implican que la tecnología solo o la conciencia por sí sola puede no abordar el corazón del problema de privacidad. Las tecnologías mejoradas (con menores costos de adopción y protección) y más información sobre riesgos y oportunidades ciertamente pueden ayudar. Sin embargo, también se deben abordar mecanismos de comportamiento humano más fundamentales. La autorregulación, incluso en presencia de información y conciencia completa, no se puede confiar en que funcione por las mismas razones. Puede ser necesaria una combinación de tecnología, conciencia y políticas regulativas, calibradas para generar y hacer cumplir los pasivos e incentivos para las partes apropiadas, para el aumento de bienestar relacionado con la privacidad (como en otras áreas de una economía: ver en un análisis relacionado [25]). Observar que las personas no quieren pagar por la privacidad o no le importa la privacidad, por lo tanto, es solo una mitad de la verdad. Es posible que las personas no puedan actuar como agentes económicamente racionales cuando se trata de privacidad personal. ¿Y la pregunta de si a los consumidores les importa?¿Es una pregunta diferente de la privacidad? Ya sea desde un punto de vista económico, la privacidad debería estar protegida o no, sigue siendo una pregunta abierta. Es una pregunta que implica definir contextos específicos en los que se invoca el concepto de privacidad. Pero el valor de la privacidad eventualmente va más allá de los ámbitos del razonamiento económico y el análisis de beneficios de costos, y termina en relación con las opiniones sobre la sociedad y la libertad. Aún así, incluso desde una perspectiva puramente económica, la evidencia anecdótica sugiere que los costos de privacidad (desde el spam hasta el robo de identidad, las ventas perdidas, las intrusiones y similares [30, 12, 17, 33, 26]) son altos y aumentados.6.

        "The boundaries between private and public become blurred.",
        "Privacy has therefore become more a class of multifaceted interests than a single, unambiguous concept.",
        "Hence its value may be discussed (if not ascertained) only once its context has also been specified.",
        "This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place.",
        "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
        "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

        "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
        "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
        "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
        "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
        "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",
        "Similarly, the expected benefit from keeping information private will also be a collection over time of probability distributions dependent on several parameters.",

        "What is her knowledge of the existence and characteristics of protective technologies?",
        "Economic transactions are often characterized by incomplete or asymmetric information.",
        "Different parties involved may not have the same amount of information about the transaction and may be uncertain about some important aspects of it [4].",
        "Incomplete information will affect almost all parameters in Equation 1, and in particular the estimation of costs and benefits.",
        "Costs and benefits associated with privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both monetary and immaterial.",
        "Monetary costs may for instance include adoption costs (which are probably fixed) and usage costs (which are variable) of protective technologies - if the individual decides to protect herself.",
        "Or they may include the financial costs associated to identity theft, if the individuals information turns out not to have been adequately protected.",
        "Immaterial costs may include learning costs of a protective technology, switching costs between different applications, or social stigma when using anonymizing technologies, and many others.",
        "Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails).",
        "It is difficult for an individual to estimate all these values.",
        "Through information technology, privacy invasions can be ubiquitous and invisible.",
        "Many of the payoffs associated with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or ascertained only ex post through actual experience.",
        "Consider, for instance, the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting technologies described in [43].",
        "In addition, the calculations implicit in Equation 1 depend on incomplete information about the probability distribution of future events.",
        "Some of those distributions may be predicted after comparable data - for example, the probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud today could be calculated using existing statistics.",
        "The probability distributions of other events may be very difficult to estimate because the environment is too dynamicfor example, the probability of being subject to identity theft 5 years in the future because of certain data you are releasing now.",
        "And the distributions of some other events may be almost completely subjective - for example, the probability that a new and practical form of attack on a currently secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal communications a few years from now.",
        "This leads to a related problem: bounded rationality. 2.",
        "Bounded rationality.",
        "Is the individual able to calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice?",
        "Or is she limited by bounded rationality?",
        "In our context, bounded rationality refers to the inability to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs associated with various strategies the individual may choose in privacy-sensitive situations.",
        "It also refers to the inability to process all the stochastic information related to risks and probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits. 23 In traditional economic theory, the agent is assumed to have both rationality and unbounded computational power to process information.",
        "But human agents are unable to process all information in their hands and draw accurate conclusions from it [34].",
        "In the scenario we consider, once an individual provides personal information to other parties, she literally loses control of that information.",
        "That loss of control propagates through other parties and persists for unpredictable spans of time.",
        "Being in a position of information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she is transacting, decisions must be based on stochastic assessments, and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect the individual become very difficult to aggregate, calculate, and compare.2 Bounded rationality will affect the calculation of the parameters in Equation 1, and in particular δ, γ, vE(), and pt().",
        "The cognitive costs involved in trying to calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that the individual may just resort to simple heuristics. 3.",
        "Psychological distortions.",
        "Eventually, even if an individual had access to complete information and could appropriately compute it, she still may find it difficult to follow the rational strategy presented in Equation 1.",
        "A vast body of economic and psychological literature has by now confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological distortions on individual decision making.",
        "Privacy seems to be a case study encompassing many of those distortions: hyperbolic discounting, under insurance, self-control problems, immediate gratification, and others.",
        "The traditional dichotomy between attitude and behavior, observed in several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social psychology literature since [24] and [13], may also appear in the privacy space because of these distortions.",
        "For example, individuals have a tendency to discount hyperbolically future costs or benefits [31, 27].",
        "In economics, hyperbolic discounting implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events.",
        "Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
        "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",
        "People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences.",
        "Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable.",
        "For example, a small and apparently innocuous piece of information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous liability in the right context. 3 A more rigorous description and application of hyperbolic discounting is provided in Section 4.",
        "In addition, individuals suffer from optimism bias [42], the misperception that ones risks are lower than those of other individuals under similar conditions.",
        "Optimism bias may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy intrusions.",
        "Individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with cumulative risks. [35], for instance, shows that while young smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking, they do not fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a serious danger.",
        "Difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks apply to privacy, because our personal information, once released, can remain available over long periods of time.",
        "And since it can be correlated to other data, the anonymity sets [32, 14] in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller.",
        "As a result, the whole risk associated with revealing different pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the individual risks associated with each piece of data.",
        "Also, it is easier to deal with actions and effects that are closer to us in time.",
        "Actions and effects that are in the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited foresight perspective.",
        "As the foresight changes, so does behavior, even when preferences remain the same [20].",
        "This phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions, since the costs of privacy protection may be immediate, but the rewards may be invisible (absence of intrusions) and spread over future periods of time.",
        "To summarize: whenever we face privacy sensitive decisions, we hardly have all data necessary for an informed choice.",
        "But even if we had, we would be likely unable to process it.",
        "And even if we could process it, we may still end behaving against our own better judgment.",
        "In what follows, we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based on some of these findings, and in particular on the plight of immediate gratification. 4.",
        "PRIVACY AND THE ECONOMICS OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by ODonoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A persons relative preference for wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their long-run selves do not appreciate.",
        "For example, if you were given only two alternatives, on Monday you may claim you will prefer working 5 hours on Saturday to 5 hours and half on Sunday.",
        "But as Saturday comes, you will be more likely to prefer postponing work until Sunday.",
        "This simple observation has rather important consequences in economic theory, where time-consistency of preferences is the dominant model.",
        "Consider first the traditional model of utility that agents derive from consumption: the model states that utility discounts exponentially over time: Ut = T τ=t δτ uτ (2) In Equation 2, the cumulative utility U at time t is the discounted sum of all utilities from time t (the present) until time T (the future). δ is the discount factor, with a value 24 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Benefits from selling period 1 2 0 0 0 Costs from selling period 1 0 1 1 1 Benefits from selling period 2 0 2 0 0 Costs from selling period 2 0 0 1 1 Benefits from selling period 3 0 0 2 0 Costs from selling period 3 0 0 0 1 Table 1: (Fictional) expected payoffs from joining loyalty program. between 0 and 1.",
        "A value of 0 would imply that the individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods is worth zero today.",
        "A value of 1 would imply that the individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities.",
        "The discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact that having (say) one dollar one year from now is valuable, but not as much as having that dollar now.",
        "In Equation 2, if all uτ were constant - for instance, 10 - and δ was 0.9, then at time t = 0 (that is, now) u0 would be worth 10, but u1 would be worth 9.",
        "Modifying the traditional model of utility discounting, [23] and then [31] have proposed a model which takes into account possible time-inconsistency of preferences.",
        "Consider Equation 3: Ut(ut, ut+1, ..., uT ) = δt ut + β T τ=t+1 δτ uτ (3) Assume that δ, β ∈ [0, 1]. δ is the discount factor for intertemporal utility as in Equation 2. β is the parameter that captures an individuals tendency to gratify herself immediately (a form of time-inconsistent preferences).",
        "When β is 1, the model maps the traditional time-consistent utility model, and Equation 3 is identical to Equation 2.",
        "But when β is zero, the individual does not care for anything but today.",
        "In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias.",
        "The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future.",
        "This analytical framework can be applied to the study of privacy attitudes and behavior.",
        "Protecting your privacy sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it represents something akin to getting an insurance against future and only uncertain risks.",
        "In surveys completed at time t = 0, subjects asked about their attitude towards privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting themselves at a later time t = s and compare those to the avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant future t = s + n. Their alternatives at survey time 0 are represented in Equation 4. min wrt x DU0 = β[(E(cs,p)δs x) + (E(cs+n,i)δs+n (1 − x))] (4) x is a dummy variable that can take values 0 or 1.",
        "It represents the individuals choice - which costs the individual opts to face: the expected cost of protecting herself at time s, E(cs,p) (in which case x = 1), or the expected costs of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s + n, E(cs+n,i).",
        "The individual is trying to minimize the disutility DU of these costs with respect to x.",
        "Because she discounts the two future events with the same discount factor (although at different times), for certain values of the parameters the individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is worthy.",
        "In particular, this will happen when: E(cs,p)δs < E(cs+n,i)δs+n (5) Now, consider what happens as the moment t = s comes.",

        "Now the individual will perceive a different picture: min wrt x DUs = δE(cs,p)x + βE(cn,i)δn (1 − x)] (6) Note that nothing has changed in the equation (certainly not the individuals perceived risks) except time.",
        "If β (the parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems) is less than one, chances are that the individual now will actually choose not to protect herself.",

        "By period 2, in fact, they will (correctly) realize that if they wait till period 3 (which they are tempted to do, because 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2)), their self-control bias will lead them to postpone adopting the technology once more (because 8 > 15 ∗ (1/2)).",
        "Therefore they predict they would incur the expected cost 15 ∗ (1/2), which is larger than 6the cost of protecting oneself in period 2.",
        "In period 1, however, they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect themselves further than period 2.",
        "So they wait till period 2, because 5 > 6 ∗ (1/2), at which time they will adopt a protective technology (see also [31]).",
        "To summarize, time-inconsistent people tend not to fully appreciate future risks and, if na¨ıve, also their inability to deal with them.",
        "This happens even if they are aware of those risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing.",
        "As we learnt from the second scenario, time inconsistency can lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks.",
        "Individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present low risks, but their repetition forms a huge liability: it is a deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly appreciated only after privacy itself is lost.",
        "This dynamics captures the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32, 14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.",
        "In addition, [31] show that when costs are immediate, time-inconsistent individuals tend to procrastinate; when benefits are immediate, they tend to preoperate.",
        "In our context things are even more interesting because all privacy decisions involve at the same time costs and benefits.",

        "And we give away our personal information to supermarkets in order to gain immediate discounts - which will likely turn into price discrimination in due time [3, 26].",
        "We have shown in the second scenario above how sophisticated but time-inconsistent individuals may choose to protect their information only in period 2.",
        "Sophisticated people with self-control problems may be at a loss, sometimes even when compared to na¨ıve people with time inconsistency problems (how many privacy advocates do use privacy enhancing technologies all the time?).",
        "The reasoning is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control problems, and rather than ignoring them, they incorporate them into their decision process.",
        "This may decrease their own incentive to behave in the optimal way now.",
        "Sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic, and so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to that, a form of coherent arbitrariness).",
        "This is consistent with the results by [36] presented at the ACM EC 01 conference. [36] found that privacy advocates were also willing to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary rewards.",
        "It is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about available technologies.",
        "Individuals in the abstract scenarios we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs.",
        "However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of those liabilities is almost irrelevant.",
        "The individual will take very slowly increasing risks, which become steps towards huge liabilities. 5.",
        "DISCUSSION Applying models of self-control bias and immediate gratification to the study of privacy decision making may offer a new perspective on the ongoing privacy debate.",
        "We have shown that a model of rational privacy behavior is unrealistic, while models based on psychological distortions offer a more accurate depiction of the decision process.",
        "We have shown why individuals who genuinely would like to protect their privacy may not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral economics literature.",
        "We have highlighted that these distortions may affect not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones.",
        "Surprisingly, we have also found that these inconsistencies may occur when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant.",
        "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
        "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
        "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",
        "However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors.",
        "Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions.",
        "An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda.",
        "The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the privacy problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention.",
        "The conclusions we have reached suggest that individuals may not be trusted to make decisions in their best interests when it comes to privacy.",
        "This does not mean that privacy technologies are ineffective.",
        "On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of privacy enhancing tools.",
        "However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the privacy problem.",
        "Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help.",
        "However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed.",
        "Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons.",
        "A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]).",
        "Observing that people do not want to pay for privacy or do not care about privacy, therefore, is only a half truth.",
        "People may not be able to act as economically rational agents when it comes to personal privacy.",
        "And the question whether do consumers care? is a different question from does privacy matter?",
        "Whether from an economic standpoint privacy ought to be protected or not, is still an open question.",
        "It is a question that involves defining specific contexts in which the concept of privacy is being invoked.",
        "But the value of privacy eventually goes beyond the realms of economic reasoning and cost benefit analysis, and ends up relating to ones views on society and freedom.",
        "Still, even from a purely economic perspective, anecdotal evidence suggest that the costs of privacy (from spam to identity theft, lost sales, intrusions, and the like [30, 12, 17, 33, 26]) are high and increasing. 6.",

                "Sophisticated people with self-control problems may be at a loss, sometimes even when compared to na¨ıve people with time inconsistency problems (how many <br>privacy</br> advocates do use <br>privacy</br> enhancing technologies all the time?).",
                "The reasoning is that sophisticated people are aware of their self-control problems, and rather than ignoring them, they incorporate them into their decision process.",
                "This may decrease their own incentive to behave in the optimal way now.",
                "Sophisticated <br>privacy</br> advocates might realize that protecting themselves from any possible <br>privacy</br> intrusion is unrealistic, and so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to that, a form of coherent arbitrariness).",
                "This is consistent with the results by [36] presented at the ACM EC 01 conference. [36] found that <br>privacy</br> advocates were also willing to reveal personal information in exchange for monetary rewards.",
                "It is also interesting to note that these inconsistencies are not caused by ignorance of existing risks or confusion about available technologies.",
                "Individuals in the abstract scenarios we described are aware of their perceived risks and costs.",
                "However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of those liabilities is almost irrelevant.",

                "We have shown why individuals who genuinely would like to protect their <br>privacy</br> may not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral economics literature.",
                "We have highlighted that these distortions may affect not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones.",
                "Surprisingly, we have also found that these inconsistencies may occur when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their <br>privacy</br> as significant.",
                "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
                "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of <br>privacy</br> technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing <br>privacy</br> concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",
                "However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors.",
                "Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions.",
                "An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda.",
                "The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the <br>privacy</br> problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention.",
                "The conclusions we have reached suggest that individuals may not be trusted to make decisions in their best interests when it comes to <br>privacy</br>.",
                "This does not mean that <br>privacy</br> technologies are ineffective.",
                "On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of <br>privacy</br> enhancing tools.",
                "However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the <br>privacy</br> problem.",
                "Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help.",
                "However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed.",
                "Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons.",
                "A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for <br>privacy</br>-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]).",
                "Observing that people do not want to pay for <br>privacy</br> or do not care about <br>privacy</br>, therefore, is only a half truth.",

                "Hence its value may be discussed (if not ascertained) only once its context has also been specified.",
                "This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place.",
                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "The functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable weights and attitudes an individual may have towards keeping her information private (for example, her privacy sensitivity, or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect should be enforced by the government) and completing certain transactions.",
                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
                "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",

                "More precisely, an agent will face three problems when comparing the tradeoffs implicit in Equation 1: incomplete information about all parameters; bounded power to process all available information; no deviation from the rational path towards utilitymaximization.",

                "Costs and benefits associated with privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both monetary and immaterial.",
                "Monetary costs may for instance include adoption costs (which are probably fixed) and usage costs (which are variable) of protective technologies - if the individual decides to protect herself.",
                "Or they may include the financial costs associated to identity theft, if the individuals information turns out not to have been adequately protected.",
                "Immaterial costs may include learning costs of a protective technology, switching costs between different applications, or social stigma when using anonymizing technologies, and many others.",
                "Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails).",
                "It is difficult for an individual to estimate all these values.",
                "Through information technology, privacy invasions can be ubiquitous and invisible.",
                "Many of the payoffs associated with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or ascertained only ex post through actual experience.",
                "Consider, for instance, the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting technologies described in [43].",
                "In addition, the calculations implicit in Equation 1 depend on incomplete information about the probability distribution of future events.",
                "Some of those distributions may be predicted after comparable data - for example, the probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud today could be calculated using existing statistics.",
                "The probability distributions of other events may be very difficult to estimate because the environment is too dynamicfor example, the probability of being subject to identity theft 5 years in the future because of certain data you are releasing now.",
                "And the distributions of some other events may be almost completely subjective - for example, the probability that a new and practical form of attack on a currently secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal communications a few years from now.",

                "Bounded rationality.",
                "Is the individual able to calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice?",
                "Or is she limited by bounded rationality?",
                "In our context, bounded rationality refers to the inability to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs associated with various strategies the individual may choose in privacy-sensitive situations.",
                "It also refers to the inability to process all the stochastic information related to risks and probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits. 23 In traditional economic theory, the agent is assumed to have both rationality and unbounded computational power to process information.",
                "But human agents are unable to process all information in their hands and draw accurate conclusions from it [34].",
                "In the scenario we consider, once an individual provides personal information to other parties, she literally loses control of that information.",
                "That loss of control propagates through other parties and persists for unpredictable spans of time.",
                "Being in a position of information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she is transacting, decisions must be based on stochastic assessments, and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect the individual become very difficult to aggregate, calculate, and compare.2 Bounded rationality will affect the calculation of the parameters in Equation 1, and in particular δ, γ, vE(), and pt().",
                "The cognitive costs involved in trying to calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that the individual may just resort to simple heuristics. 3.",
                "Psychological distortions.",
                "Eventually, even if an individual had access to complete information and could appropriately compute it, she still may find it difficult to follow the rational strategy presented in Equation 1.",
                "A vast body of economic and psychological literature has by now confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological distortions on individual decision making.",
                "Privacy seems to be a case study encompassing many of those distortions: hyperbolic discounting, under insurance, self-control problems, immediate gratification, and others.",
                "The traditional dichotomy between attitude and behavior, observed in several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social psychology literature since [24] and [13], may also appear in the privacy space because of these distortions.",
                "For example, individuals have a tendency to discount hyperbolically future costs or benefits [31, 27].",
                "In economics, hyperbolic discounting implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events.",
                "Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
                "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",
                "People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences.",
                "Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable.",
                "For example, a small and apparently innocuous piece of information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous liability in the right context. 3 A more rigorous description and application of hyperbolic discounting is provided in Section 4.",
                "In addition, individuals suffer from optimism bias [42], the misperception that ones risks are lower than those of other individuals under similar conditions.",
                "Optimism bias may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy intrusions.",
                "Individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with cumulative risks. [35], for instance, shows that while young smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking, they do not fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a serious danger.",
                "Difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks apply to privacy, because our personal information, once released, can remain available over long periods of time.",
                "And since it can be correlated to other data, the anonymity sets [32, 14] in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller.",
                "As a result, the whole risk associated with revealing different pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the individual risks associated with each piece of data.",
                "Also, it is easier to deal with actions and effects that are closer to us in time.",
                "Actions and effects that are in the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited foresight perspective.",
                "As the foresight changes, so does behavior, even when preferences remain the same [20].",
                "This phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions, since the costs of privacy protection may be immediate, but the rewards may be invisible (absence of intrusions) and spread over future periods of time.",
                "To summarize: whenever we face privacy sensitive decisions, we hardly have all data necessary for an informed choice.",
                "But even if we had, we would be likely unable to process it.",
                "And even if we could process it, we may still end behaving against our own better judgment.",
                "In what follows, we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based on some of these findings, and in particular on the plight of immediate gratification. 4.",
                "PRIVACY AND THE ECONOMICS OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by ODonoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A persons relative preference for wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their long-run selves do not appreciate.",

                "In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias.",
                "The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future.",

                "This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place.",
                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "The functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable weights and attitudes an individual may have towards keeping her information private (for example, her privacy sensitivity, or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect should be enforced by the government) and completing certain transactions.",
                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
                "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",
                "Similarly, the expected benefit from keeping information private will also be a collection over time of probability distributions dependent on several parameters.",

                "More precisely, an agent will face three problems when comparing the tradeoffs implicit in Equation 1: incomplete information about all parameters; bounded power to process all available information; no deviation from the rational path towards utilitymaximization.",
                "Those three problems are precisely the same issues real people have to deal with on an everyday basis as they face privacy-sensitive decisions.",

                "Different parties involved may not have the same amount of information about the transaction and may be uncertain about some important aspects of it [4].",
                "Incomplete information will affect almost all parameters in Equation 1, and in particular the estimation of costs and benefits.",
                "Costs and benefits associated with privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both monetary and immaterial.",
                "Monetary costs may for instance include adoption costs (which are probably fixed) and usage costs (which are variable) of protective technologies - if the individual decides to protect herself.",
                "Or they may include the financial costs associated to identity theft, if the individuals information turns out not to have been adequately protected.",
                "Immaterial costs may include learning costs of a protective technology, switching costs between different applications, or social stigma when using anonymizing technologies, and many others.",
                "Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails).",
                "It is difficult for an individual to estimate all these values.",
                "Through information technology, privacy invasions can be ubiquitous and invisible.",
                "Many of the payoffs associated with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or ascertained only ex post through actual experience.",
                "Consider, for instance, the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting technologies described in [43].",
                "In addition, the calculations implicit in Equation 1 depend on incomplete information about the probability distribution of future events.",
                "Some of those distributions may be predicted after comparable data - for example, the probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud today could be calculated using existing statistics.",
                "The probability distributions of other events may be very difficult to estimate because the environment is too dynamicfor example, the probability of being subject to identity theft 5 years in the future because of certain data you are releasing now.",
                "And the distributions of some other events may be almost completely subjective - for example, the probability that a new and practical form of attack on a currently secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal communications a few years from now.",

                "Bounded rationality.",
                "Is the individual able to calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice?",
                "Or is she limited by bounded rationality?",
                "In our context, bounded rationality refers to the inability to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs associated with various strategies the individual may choose in privacy-sensitive situations.",
                "It also refers to the inability to process all the stochastic information related to risks and probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits. 23 In traditional economic theory, the agent is assumed to have both rationality and unbounded computational power to process information.",
                "But human agents are unable to process all information in their hands and draw accurate conclusions from it [34].",
                "In the scenario we consider, once an individual provides personal information to other parties, she literally loses control of that information.",
                "That loss of control propagates through other parties and persists for unpredictable spans of time.",
                "Being in a position of information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she is transacting, decisions must be based on stochastic assessments, and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect the individual become very difficult to aggregate, calculate, and compare.2 Bounded rationality will affect the calculation of the parameters in Equation 1, and in particular δ, γ, vE(), and pt().",
                "The cognitive costs involved in trying to calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that the individual may just resort to simple heuristics. 3.",
                "Psychological distortions.",
                "Eventually, even if an individual had access to complete information and could appropriately compute it, she still may find it difficult to follow the rational strategy presented in Equation 1.",
                "A vast body of economic and psychological literature has by now confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological distortions on individual decision making.",
                "Privacy seems to be a case study encompassing many of those distortions: hyperbolic discounting, under insurance, self-control problems, immediate gratification, and others.",
                "The traditional dichotomy between attitude and behavior, observed in several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social psychology literature since [24] and [13], may also appear in the privacy space because of these distortions.",
                "For example, individuals have a tendency to discount hyperbolically future costs or benefits [31, 27].",
                "In economics, hyperbolic discounting implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events.",
                "Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
                "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",
                "People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences.",
                "Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable.",
                "For example, a small and apparently innocuous piece of information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous liability in the right context. 3 A more rigorous description and application of hyperbolic discounting is provided in Section 4.",
                "In addition, individuals suffer from optimism bias [42], the misperception that ones risks are lower than those of other individuals under similar conditions.",
                "Optimism bias may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy intrusions.",
                "Individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with cumulative risks. [35], for instance, shows that while young smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking, they do not fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a serious danger.",
                "Difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks apply to privacy, because our personal information, once released, can remain available over long periods of time.",
                "And since it can be correlated to other data, the anonymity sets [32, 14] in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller.",
                "As a result, the whole risk associated with revealing different pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the individual risks associated with each piece of data.",
                "Also, it is easier to deal with actions and effects that are closer to us in time.",
                "Actions and effects that are in the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited foresight perspective.",
                "As the foresight changes, so does behavior, even when preferences remain the same [20].",
                "This phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions, since the costs of privacy protection may be immediate, but the rewards may be invisible (absence of intrusions) and spread over future periods of time.",
                "To summarize: whenever we face privacy sensitive decisions, we hardly have all data necessary for an informed choice.",
                "But even if we had, we would be likely unable to process it.",
                "And even if we could process it, we may still end behaving against our own better judgment.",
                "In what follows, we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based on some of these findings, and in particular on the plight of immediate gratification. 4.",
                "PRIVACY AND THE ECONOMICS OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, hyperbolic discounting, and self-control bias) is so described by ODonoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A persons relative preference for wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their long-run selves do not appreciate.",

                "A value of 0 would imply that the individual discounts so heavily that the utility from future periods is worth zero today.",
                "A value of 1 would imply that the individual is so patient she does not discount future utilities.",
                "The discount factor is used in economics to capture the fact that having (say) one dollar one year from now is valuable, but not as much as having that dollar now.",
                "In Equation 2, if all uτ were constant - for instance, 10 - and δ was 0.9, then at time t = 0 (that is, now) u0 would be worth 10, but u1 would be worth 9.",
                "Modifying the traditional model of utility discounting, [23] and then [31] have proposed a model which takes into account possible time-inconsistency of preferences.",

                "When β is 1, the model maps the traditional time-consistent utility model, and Equation 3 is identical to Equation 2.",
                "But when β is zero, the individual does not care for anything but today.",
                "In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias.",
                "The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future.",

                "Protecting your privacy sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it represents something akin to getting an insurance against future and only uncertain risks.",
                "In surveys completed at time t = 0, subjects asked about their attitude towards privacy risks may mentally consider some costs of protecting themselves at a later time t = s and compare those to the avoided costs of privacy intrusions in an even more distant future t = s + n. Their alternatives at survey time 0 are represented in Equation 4. min wrt x DU0 = β[(E(cs,p)δs x) + (E(cs+n,i)δs+n (1 − x))] (4) x is a dummy variable that can take values 0 or 1.",
                "It represents the individuals choice - which costs the individual opts to face: the expected cost of protecting herself at time s, E(cs,p) (in which case x = 1), or the expected costs of being subject to privacy intrusions at a later time s + n, E(cs+n,i).",
                "The individual is trying to minimize the disutility DU of these costs with respect to x.",
                "Because she discounts the two future events with the same discount factor (although at different times), for certain values of the parameters the individual may conclude that paying to protect herself is worthy.",

                "If β (the parameter indicating the degree of self-control problems) is less than one, chances are that the individual now will actually choose not to protect herself.",

                "At survey time the individual honestly claimed she wanted to protect herself in principlethat is, some time in the future.",
                "But as she is asked to make an effort to protect herself right now, she chooses to run the risk of privacy intrusion.",
                "Similar mathematical arguments can be made for the comparison between immediate costs with immediate benefits (subscribing to a no-call list to stop telemarketers from harassing you at dinner), and immediate costs with only future expected rewards (insuring yourself against identity theft, or protecting yourself from frauds by never using your credit card on-line), particularly when expected future rewards (or avoided risks) are also intangible: the immaterial consequences of living (or not) in a dossier society, or the chilling effects (or lack thereof) of being under surveillance.",
                "The reader will have noticed that we have focused on perceived (expected) costs E(c), rather than real costs.",
                "We do not know the real costs and we do not claim that the 25 individual does.",
                "But we are able to show that under certain conditions even costs perceived as very high (as during periods of intense privacy debate) will be ignored.",

                "If she decides not to protect herself, the cost will be the expected consequences of privacy intrusions.",
                "We assume that both these aggregate costs increase over time, although because of separate dynamics.",
                "As time goes by, more and more information about the individual has been revealed, and it becomes more costly to be protected against privacy intrusions.",
                "At the same time, however, intrusions become more frequent and dangerous. 4 One may claim that loyalty cards keep on providing benefits over time.",
                "Here we make the simplifying assumption that such benefits are not larger than the future costs incurred after having revealed ones tastes.",

                "But in the second period they will be comparing 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2) - and so they will postpone their protection again.",
                "They will keep on doing so, facing higher and higher risks.",
                "Eventually, they will risk to incur the highest perceived costs of privacy intrusions (note again that we are simply assuming that individuals believe there are privacy risks and that they increase over time; we will come back to this concept later on).",
                "Time-inconsistent but sophisticated individuals, on the other side, will adopt a protective technology in period 2 and pay 6.",
                "By period 2, in fact, they will (correctly) realize that if they wait till period 3 (which they are tempted to do, because 6 > 9 ∗ (1/2)), their self-control bias will lead them to postpone adopting the technology once more (because 8 > 15 ∗ (1/2)).",
                "Therefore they predict they would incur the expected cost 15 ∗ (1/2), which is larger than 6the cost of protecting oneself in period 2.",
                "In period 1, however, they correctly predict that they will not wait to protect themselves further than period 2.",
                "So they wait till period 2, because 5 > 6 ∗ (1/2), at which time they will adopt a protective technology (see also [31]).",
                "To summarize, time-inconsistent people tend not to fully appreciate future risks and, if na¨ıve, also their inability to deal with them.",
                "This happens even if they are aware of those risks and they are aware that those risks are increasing.",
                "As we learnt from the second scenario, time inconsistency can lead individuals to accept higher and higher risks.",
                "Individuals may tend to downplay the fact that single actions present low risks, but their repetition forms a huge liability: it is a deceiving aspect of privacy that its value is truly appreciated only after privacy itself is lost.",
                "This dynamics captures the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32, 14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.",

                "We have highlighted that these distortions may affect not only na¨ıve individuals but also sophisticated ones.",
                "Surprisingly, we have also found that these inconsistencies may occur when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant.",
                "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
                "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",
                "However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors.",
                "Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions.",
                "An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda.",
                "The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the privacy problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention.",
                "The conclusions we have reached suggest that individuals may not be trusted to make decisions in their best interests when it comes to privacy.",
                "This does not mean that privacy technologies are ineffective.",
                "On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of privacy enhancing tools.",
                "However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the privacy problem.",
                "Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help.",
                "However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed.",
                "Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons.",
                "A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]).",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place.",
                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "The functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable weights and attitudes an individual may have towards keeping her information private (for example, her privacy sensitivity, or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect should be enforced by the government) and completing certain transactions.",
                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
                "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",

                "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
                "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",
                "However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors.",
                "Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions.",
                "An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda.",
                "The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the privacy problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention.",

                "On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of privacy enhancing tools.",
                "However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the privacy problem.",
                "Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help.",
                "However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed.",
                "Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons.",
                "A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]).",

More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",

                "Sophisticated privacy advocates might realize that protecting themselves from any possible privacy intrusion is unrealistic, and so they may start misbehaving now (and may get used to that, a form of coherent arbitrariness).",

                "Surprisingly, we have also found that these inconsistencies may occur when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant.",
                "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
                "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",
                "However, only an experimental approach over different periods of time in a controlled environment may allow us to disentangle the influence of several factors.",
                "Surveys alone cannot suffice, since we have shown why survey-time attitudes will rarely match decision-time actions.",
                "An experimental verification is part of our ongoing research agenda.",
                "The psychological distortions we have discussed may be considered in the ongoing debate on how to deal with the privacy problem: industry self-regulation, users self protection (through technology or other strategies), or governments intervention.",

                "This does not mean that privacy technologies are ineffective.",
                "On the contrary, our results, by aiming at offering a more realistic model of user-behavior, could be of help to technologists in their design of privacy enhancing tools.",
                "However, our results also imply that technology alone or awareness alone may not address the heart of the privacy problem.",
                "Improved technologies (with lower costs of adoption and protection) and more information about risks and opportunities certainly can help.",
                "However, more fundamental human behavioral mechanisms must also be addressed.",
                "Self-regulation, even in presence of complete information and awareness, may not be trusted to work for the same reasons.",
                "A combination of technology, awareness, and regulative policies - calibrated to generate and enforce liabilities and incentives for the appropriate parties - may be needed for privacy-related welfare increase (as in other areas of an economy: see on a related analysis [25]).",

More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",

                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",

More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
                "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",

                "Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails).",

                "Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
                "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "The boundaries between private and public become blurred.",
                "Privacy has therefore become more a class of multifaceted interests than a single, unambiguous concept.",
                "Hence its value may be discussed (if not ascertained) only once its context has also been specified.",
                "This most often requires the study of a network of relations between a subject, certain information (related to the subject), other parties (that may have various linkages of interest or association with that information or that subject), and the context in which such linkages take place.",
                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",
                "For instance, revealing ones identity to an on-line bookstore may earn a discount.",

                "The functional parameters δ and γ embody the variable weights and attitudes an individual may have towards keeping her information private (for example, her privacy sensitivity, or her belief that privacy is a right whose respect should be enforced by the government) and completing certain transactions.",
                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",
                "The probability of keeping information private will also depend on the environment in which the transaction is taking place.",
                "Similarly, the expected benefit from keeping information private will also be a collection over time of probability distributions dependent on several parameters.",
                "Imagine that the probability of keeping your financial transactions private is very high when you use a bank in Bermuda: still, the expected value from keeping your financial information confidential will depend on a number of other factors.",

                "More precisely, an agent will face three problems when comparing the tradeoffs implicit in Equation 1: incomplete information about all parameters; bounded power to process all available information; no deviation from the rational path towards utilitymaximization.",

                "Incomplete information will affect almost all parameters in Equation 1, and in particular the estimation of costs and benefits.",
                "Costs and benefits associated with privacy protection and privacy intrusions are both monetary and immaterial.",
                "Monetary costs may for instance include adoption costs (which are probably fixed) and usage costs (which are variable) of protective technologies - if the individual decides to protect herself.",
                "Or they may include the financial costs associated to identity theft, if the individuals information turns out not to have been adequately protected.",
                "Immaterial costs may include learning costs of a protective technology, switching costs between different applications, or social stigma when using anonymizing technologies, and many others.",
                "Likewise, the benefits from protecting (or not protecting) personal information may also be easy to quantify in monetary terms (the discount you receive for revealing personal data) or be intangible (the feeling of protection when you send encrypted emails).",
                "It is difficult for an individual to estimate all these values.",
                "Through information technology, privacy invasions can be ubiquitous and invisible.",
                "Many of the payoffs associated with privacy protection or intrusion may be discovered or ascertained only ex post through actual experience.",
                "Consider, for instance, the difficulties in using privacy and encrypting technologies described in [43].",
                "In addition, the calculations implicit in Equation 1 depend on incomplete information about the probability distribution of future events.",
                "Some of those distributions may be predicted after comparable data - for example, the probability that a certain credit card transaction will result in fraud today could be calculated using existing statistics.",
                "The probability distributions of other events may be very difficult to estimate because the environment is too dynamicfor example, the probability of being subject to identity theft 5 years in the future because of certain data you are releasing now.",
                "And the distributions of some other events may be almost completely subjective - for example, the probability that a new and practical form of attack on a currently secure cryptosystem will expose all of your encrypted personal communications a few years from now.",

                "Bounded rationality.",
                "Is the individual able to calculate all the parameters relevant to her choice?",
                "Or is she limited by bounded rationality?",
                "In our context, bounded rationality refers to the inability to calculate and compare the magnitudes of payoffs associated with various strategies the individual may choose in privacy-sensitive situations.",
                "It also refers to the inability to process all the stochastic information related to risks and probabilities of events leading to privacy costs and benefits. 23 In traditional economic theory, the agent is assumed to have both rationality and unbounded computational power to process information.",
                "But human agents are unable to process all information in their hands and draw accurate conclusions from it [34].",
                "In the scenario we consider, once an individual provides personal information to other parties, she literally loses control of that information.",
                "That loss of control propagates through other parties and persists for unpredictable spans of time.",
                "Being in a position of information asymmetry with respect to the party with whom she is transacting, decisions must be based on stochastic assessments, and the magnitudes of the factors that may affect the individual become very difficult to aggregate, calculate, and compare.2 Bounded rationality will affect the calculation of the parameters in Equation 1, and in particular δ, γ, vE(), and pt().",
                "The cognitive costs involved in trying to calculate the best strategy could therefore be so high that the individual may just resort to simple heuristics. 3.",
                "Psychological distortions.",
                "Eventually, even if an individual had access to complete information and could appropriately compute it, she still may find it difficult to follow the rational strategy presented in Equation 1.",
                "A vast body of economic and psychological literature has by now confirmed the impact of several forms of psychological distortions on individual decision making.",
                "Privacy seems to be a case study encompassing many of those distortions: <br>hyperbolic discounting</br>, under insurance, self-control problems, immediate gratification, and others.",
                "The traditional dichotomy between attitude and behavior, observed in several aspects of human psychology and studied in the social psychology literature since [24] and [13], may also appear in the privacy space because of these distortions.",
                "For example, individuals have a tendency to discount hyperbolically future costs or benefits [31, 27].",
                "In economics, <br>hyperbolic discounting</br> implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events.",
                "<br>hyperbolic discounting</br> may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to <br>hyperbolic discounting</br> is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
                "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",
                "People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences.",
                "Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable.",
                "For example, a small and apparently innocuous piece of information might become a crucial asset or a dangerous liability in the right context. 3 A more rigorous description and application of <br>hyperbolic discounting</br> is provided in Section 4.",
                "In addition, individuals suffer from optimism bias [42], the misperception that ones risks are lower than those of other individuals under similar conditions.",
                "Optimism bias may lead us to believe that we will not be subject to privacy intrusions.",
                "Individuals encounter difficulties when dealing with cumulative risks. [35], for instance, shows that while young smokers appreciate the long term risks of smoking, they do not fully realize the cumulative relation between the low risks of each additional cigarette and the slow building up of a serious danger.",
                "Difficulties with dealing with cumulative risks apply to privacy, because our personal information, once released, can remain available over long periods of time.",
                "And since it can be correlated to other data, the anonymity sets [32, 14] in which we wish to remain hidden get smaller.",
                "As a result, the whole risk associated with revealing different pieces of personal information is more than the sum of the individual risks associated with each piece of data.",
                "Also, it is easier to deal with actions and effects that are closer to us in time.",
                "Actions and effects that are in the distant future are difficult to focus on given our limited foresight perspective.",
                "As the foresight changes, so does behavior, even when preferences remain the same [20].",
                "This phenomenon may also affects privacy decisions, since the costs of privacy protection may be immediate, but the rewards may be invisible (absence of intrusions) and spread over future periods of time.",
                "To summarize: whenever we face privacy sensitive decisions, we hardly have all data necessary for an informed choice.",
                "But even if we had, we would be likely unable to process it.",
                "And even if we could process it, we may still end behaving against our own better judgment.",
                "In what follows, we present a model of privacy attitudes and behavior based on some of these findings, and in particular on the plight of immediate gratification. 4.",
                "PRIVACY AND THE ECONOMICS OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION The problem of immediate gratification (which is related to the concepts of time inconsistency, <br>hyperbolic discounting</br>, and self-control bias) is so described by ODonoghue and Rabin [27, p. 4]: A persons relative preference for wellbeing at an earlier date over a later date gets stronger as the earlier date gets closer. [...] [P]eople have self-control problems caused by a tendency to pursue immediate gratification in a way that their long-run selves do not appreciate.",

                "In fact, any β smaller than 1 represents self-control bias.",
                "The experimental literature has convincingly proved that human beings tend to have self-control problems even when they claim otherwise: we tend to avoid and postpone undesirable activities even when this will imply more effort tomorrow; and we tend to over-engage in pleasant activities even though this may cause suffering or reduced utility in the future.",

                "Protecting your privacy sometimes means protecting yourself from a clear and present hassle (telemarketers, or people peeping through your window and seeing how you live - see [33]); but sometimes it represents something akin to getting an insurance against future and only uncertain risks.",

                "This dynamics captures the essence of privacy and the so-called anonymity sets [32, 14], where each bit of information we reveal can be linked to others, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.",

                "Additional uncertainties, risk aversion, and varying attitudes towards losses and gains may be confounding elements in our analysis.",
                "Empirical validation is necessary to calibrate the effects of different factors.",
                "An empirical analysis may start with the comparison of available data on the adoption rate of privacy technologies that offer immediate refuge from minor but pressing privacy concerns (for example, do not call marketing lists), with data on the adoption of privacy technologies that offer less obviously perceivable protection from more dangerous but also less visible privacy risks (for example, identity theft insurances).",

                "To understand how a rational agent could navigate through those complex relations, in Equation 1 we abstract the decision process of an idealized rational economic agent who is facing privacy trade-offs when completing a certain transaction. max d Ut = δ vE (a) , pd (a) + γ vE (t) , pd (t) − cd t (1) In Equation 1, δ and γ are unspecified functional forms that describe weighted relations between expected payoffs from a set of events v and the associated probabilities of occurrence of those events p. More precisely, the utility U of completing a transaction t (the transaction being any action - not necessarily a monetary operation - possibly involving exposure of personal information) is equal to some function of the expected payoff vE (a) from maintaining (or not) certain information private during that transaction, and the probability of maintaining [or not maintaining] that information private when using technology d, pd (a) [1 − pd (a)]; plus some function of the expected payoff vE (t) from completing (or non completing) the transaction (possibly revealing personal information), and the probability of completing [or not completing] that transaction with a certain technology d, pd (t) [1 − pd (t)]; minus the cost of using the technology t: cd t .1 The technology d may or may not be privacy enhancing.",
                "Since the payoffs in Equation 1 can be either positive or negative, Equation 1 embodies the duality implicit in privacy issues: there are both costs and benefits gained from revealing or from protecting personal information, and the costs and benefits from completing a transaction, vE (t), might be distinct from the costs and benefits from keeping the associated information private, vE (a).",

                "Note that vE and p could refer to sets of payoffs and the associated probabilities of occurrence.",
                "The payoffs are themselves only expected because, regardless of the probability that the transaction is completed or the information remains private, they may depend on other sets of events and their associated probabilities. vE() and pd (), in other words, can be read as multi-variate parameters inside which are hidden several other variables, expectations, and functions because of the complexity of the privacy network described above.",
                "Over time, the probability of keeping certain information private, for instance, will not only depend on the chosen technology d but also on the efforts by other parties to appropriate that information.",
                "These efforts may be function, among other things, of the expected value of that information to those parties.",

                "In economics, <br>hyperbolic discount</br>ing implies inconsistency of personal preferences over time - future events may be discounted at different discount rates than near-term events.",
                "Hyperbolic discounting may affect privacy decisions, for instance when we heavily discount the (low) probability of (high) future risks such as identity theft.3 Related to <br>hyperbolic discount</br>ing is the tendency to underinsure oneself against certain risks [22].",
                "In general, individuals may put constraints on future behavior that limit their own achievement of maximum utility: people may genuinely want to protect themselves, but because of self-control bias, they will not actually take those steps, and opt for immediate gratification instead.",
                "People tend to underappreciate the effects of changes in their states, and hence falsely project their current preferences over consumption onto their future preferences.",
                "Far more than suggesting merely that people mispredict future tastes, this projection bias posits a systematic pattern in these mispredictions which can lead to systematic errors in dynamicchoice environments [25, p. 2]. 2 The negative utility coming from future potential misuses of somebodys personal information could be a random shock whose probability and scope are extremely variable.",
