However, this model is not always realistic. In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision. Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously. The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position). In this paper, we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games. We give both positive results (efficient algorithms) and negative results (NP-hardness results).

INTRODUCTION In multiagent systems with self-interested agents (including most economic settings), the optimal action for one agent to take depends on the actions that the other agents take. To analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied. Typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies simultaneously. This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents. Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.) A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria. This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played. When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action. Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game. Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far. This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.) However, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner. Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower). This can be due to a variety of reasons. For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness). Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played. For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game. Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution. In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26]. Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss). In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome. Models of leadership are especially important in settings with multiple self-interested software agents. Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes. Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device. This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs. Finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining players then play. Mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the EC community: the papers published on mechanism design in recent EC conferences are too numerous to cite. Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal. For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0. In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid. Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller. A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4]. However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored. Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first. The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large. For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.) Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger. Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation. In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2. NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number. To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game. In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively. A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies. In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower. Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy. Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player. By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player. If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3. If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies. In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy). Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2. There are a few good reasons for this assumption. If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player. By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.) Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully. Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion. Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.) We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.) For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively. After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game. Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game. Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to. This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.) Theorem 1. Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time. Proof. Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players. We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility. Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game. We now present the algorithm formally. Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 . A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game. The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O. Let e be the empty vector with no elements. In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.) We note that arg max is set-valued. Then, the following algorithm computes all optimal strategy profiles: Algorithm Solve(G) if G has 0 players return {e} C ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ SG 1 { O ← Solve(Su(G, s1)) O ← arg maxo∈O uG 1 (s1, o) if C = ∅ or uG 1 (s1, O ) = uG 1 (C) C ← C∪Append(s1, O ) if uG 1 (s1, O ) > uG 1 (C) C ←Append(s1, O ) } return C Every outcome is (potentially) examined by every player, which leads to the given runtime bound. As an example of how the algorithm works, consider the following 3-player game, in which the first player chooses the left or right matrix, the second player chooses a row, and the third player chooses a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 First we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond to best responses for the third player (removing them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 Next, we remove the entries in which the third player does not break ties in favor of the second player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finally, we remove the entries in which the second and third players do not break ties in favor of the first player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the first player. 2,1,1 84 Hence, in optimal play, the first player chooses the left matrix, the second player chooses the middle row, and the third player chooses the left column. (We note that this outcome is Pareto-dominated by (Right, Middle, Left).) For general normal-form games, each players utility for each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#players · #outcomes). Therefore, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In the special case of two-player zero-sum games, computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy, which minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can obtain. Minimax strategies constitute the only natural solution concept for two-player zero-sum games: von Neumanns Minimax Theorem [24] states that in two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter (in terms of the players utilities) which player gets to commit to a mixed strategy first, and a profile of mixed strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both strategies are minimax strategies. It is well-known that a minimax strategy can be found in polynomial time, using linear programming [17]. Our first result in this section generalizes this result, showing that an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to can be efficiently computed in general-sum two-player games, again using linear programming. Theorem 2. In 2-player normal-form games, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming. Proof. For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders utility. Such a mixed strategy can be computed using the following simple linear program: maximize s∈S psul(s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, s∈S psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈S psuf (s, t ) s∈S ps = 1 We note that this program may be infeasible for some follower strategies t, for example, if t is a strictly dominated strategy. Nevertheless, the program must be feasible for at least some follower strategies; among these follower strategies, choose a strategy t∗ that maximizes the linear programs solution value. Then, if the leader chooses as her mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps for the linear program for t∗ , and the follower plays t∗ , this constitutes an optimal strategy profile. In the following result, we show that we cannot expect to solve the problem more efficiently than linear programming, because we can reduce any linear program with a probability constraint on its variables to a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normalform game. Theorem 3. Any linear program whose variables xi (with xi ∈ R≥0 ) must satsify i xi = 1 can be modeled as a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normal-form game. Proof. Let the leader have a pure strategy i for every variable xi. Let the column player have one pure strategy j for every constraint in the linear program (other than i xi = 1), and a single additional pure strategy 0. Let the utility functions be as follows. Writing the objective of the linear program as maximize i cixi, for any i, let ul(i, 0) = ci and uf (i, 0) = 0. Writing the jth constraint of the linear program (not including i xi = 1) as i aijxi ≤ bj, for any i, j > 0, let ul(i, j) = mini ci − 1 and uf (i, j) = aij − bj. For example, consider the following linear program. maximize 2x1 + x2 subject to x1 + x2 = 1 5x1 + 2x2 ≤ 3 7x1 − 2x2 ≤ 2 The optimal solution to this program is x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3. Our reduction transforms this program into the following leader-follower game (where the leader is the row player). 2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 Indeed, the optimal strategy for the leader is to play the top strategy with probability 1/3 and the bottom strategy with probability 2/3. We now show that the reduction works in general. Clearly, the leader wants to incentivize the follower to play 0, because the utility that the leader gets when the follower plays 0 is always greater than when the follower does not play 0. In order for the follower not to prefer playing j > 0 rather than 0, it must be the case that i pl(i)(aij − bj) ≤ 0, or equivalently i pl(i)aij ≤ bj. Hence the leader will get a utility of at least mini ci if and only if there is a feasible solution to the constraints. Given that the pl(i) incentivize the follower to play 0, the leader attempts to maximize i pl(i)ci. Thus the leader must solve the original linear program. As an alternative proof of Theorem 3, one may observe that it is known that finding a minimax strategy in a zerosum game is as hard as the linear programming problem [6], and as we pointed out at the beginning of this section, computing a minimax strategy in a zero-sum game is a special case of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to. This polynomial-time solvability of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in two-player normal-form games contrasts with the unknown complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium in such games [21], as well as with the NP-hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium with maximum utility for a given player in such games [8, 2]. Unfortunately, this result does not generalize to more than two players-here, the problem becomes NP-hard. To show this, we reduce from the VERTEX-COVER problem. Definition 1. In VERTEX-COVER, we are given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. We are asked whether there 85 exists a subset of the vertices S ⊆ V , with |S| = K, such that every edge e ∈ E has at least one of its endpoints in S. BALANCED-VERTEX-COVER is the special case of VERTEX-COVER in which K = |V |/2. VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete [9]. The following lemma shows that the hardness remains if we require K = |V |/2. (Similar results have been shown for other NP-complete problems.) Lemma 1. BALANCED-VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete. Proof. Membership in NP follows from the fact that the problem is a special case of VERTEX-COVER, which is in NP. To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary VERTEX-COVER instance to a BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER instance, as follows. If, for the VERTEX-COVER instance, K > |V |/2, then we simply add isolated vertices that are disjoint from the rest of the graph, until K = |V |/2. If K < |V |/2, we add isolated triangles (that is, the complete graph on three vertices) to the graph, increasing K by 2 every time, until K = |V |/2. Theorem 4. In 3-player normal-form games, finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to is NP-hard. Proof. We reduce an arbitrary BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER instance to the following 3-player normal-form game. For every vertex v, each of the three players has a pure strategy corresponding to that vertex (rv, sv, tv, respectively). In addition, for every edge e, the third player has a pure strategy te; and finally, the third player has one additional pure strategy t0. The utilities are as follows: • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, u1(r, s, t0) = u2(r, s, t0) = 1; • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, t ∈ T−{t0}, u1(r, s, t) = u2(r, s, t) = 0; • for all v ∈ V, s ∈ S, u3(rv, s, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ V, r ∈ R, u3(r, sv, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ V , for all r ∈ R − {rv}, s ∈ S − {sv}, u3(r, s, tv) = |V | |V |−2 ; • for all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, for both v ∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = 0; • for all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, for all v /∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = |V | |V |−2 . • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, u3(r, s, t0) = 1. We note that players 1 and 2 have the same utility function. We claim that there is an optimal strategy profile in which players 1 and 2 both obtain 1 (their maximum utility) if and only if there is a solution to the BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER problem. (Otherwise, these players will both obtain 0.) First, suppose there exists a solution to the BALANCEDVERTEX-COVER problem. Then, let player 1 play every rv such that v is in the cover with probability 2 |V | , and let player 2 play every sv such that v is not in the cover with probability 2 |V | . Then, for player 3, the expected utility of playing tv (for any v) is (1 − 2 |V | ) |V | |V |−2 = 1, because there is a chance of 2 |V | that rv or sv is played. Additionally, the expected utility of playing te (for any e) is at most (1 − 2 |V | ) |V | |V |−2 = 1, because there is a chance of at least 2 |V | that some rv with v ∈ e is played (because player 1 is randomizing over the pure strategies corresponding to the cover). It follows that playing t0 is a best response for player 3, giving players 1 and 2 a utility of 1. Now, suppose that players 1 and 2 obtain 1 in optimal play. Then, it must be the case that player 3 plays t0. Hence, for every v ∈ V , there must be a probability of at least 2 |V | that either rv or sv is played, for otherwise player 3 would be better off playing tv. Because players 1 and 2 have only a total probability of 2 to distribute, it must be the case that for each v, either rv or sv is played with probability 2 |V | , and the other is played with probability 0. (It is not possible for both to have nonzero probability, because then there would be some probability that both are played simultaneously (correlation is not possible), hence the total probability of at least one being played could not be high enough for all vertices.) Thus, for exactly half the v ∈ V , player 1 places probability 2 |V | on rv. Moreover, for every e ∈ E, there must be a probability of at least 2 |V | that some rv with v ∈ e is played, for otherwise player 3 would be better off playing te. Thus, the v ∈ V such that player 1 places probability 2 |V | on rv constitute a balanced vertex cover. 3. BAYESIAN GAMES So far, we have restricted our attention to normal-form games. In a normal-form game, it is assumed that every agent knows every other agents preferences over the outcomes of the game. In general, however, agents may have some private information about their preferences that is not known to the other agents. Moreover, at the time of commitment to a strategy, the agents may not even know their own (final) preferences over the outcomes of the game yet, because these preferences may be dependent on a context that has yet to materialize. For example, when the code for a trading agent is written, it may not yet be clear how that agent will value resources that it will negotiate over later, because this depends on information that is not yet available at the time at which the code is written (such as orders that will have been placed to the agent before the negotiation). In this section, we will study commitment in Bayesian games, which can model such uncertainty over preferences. 3.1 Definitions In a Bayesian game, every player i has a set of actions Si, a set of types Θi with an associated probability distribution πi : Θi → [0, 1], and, for each type θi, a utility function uθi i : S1 × S2 × . . . × Sn → R. A pure strategy in a Bayesian game is a mapping from the players types to actions, σi : Θi → Si. (Bayesian games can be rewritten in normal form by enumerating every pure strategy σi, but this will cause an exponential blowup in the size of the representation of the game and therefore cannot lead to efficient algorithms.) The strategy that the leader should commit to depends on whether, at the time of commitment, the leader knows her own type. If the leader does know her own type, the other types that the leader might have had become irrelevant and the leader should simply commit to the strategy that is optimal for the type. However, as argued above, the leader does not necessarily know her own type at the time of commitment (e.g., the time at which the code is submitted). In this case, the leader must commit to a strategy that is 86 dependent upon the leaders eventual type. We will study this latter model, although we will pay specific attention to the case where the leader has only a single type, which is effectively the same as the former model. 3.2 Commitment to pure strategies It turns out that computing an optimal pure strategy to commit to is hard in Bayesian games, even with two players. Theorem 5. Finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to in 2-player Bayesian games is NP-hard, even when the follower has only a single type. Proof. We reduce an arbitrary VERTEX-COVER instance to the following Bayesian game between the leader and the follower. The leader has K types θ1, θ2, . . . , θK , each occurring with probability 1/K, and for every vertex v ∈ V , the leader has an action sv. The follower has only a single type; for each edge e ∈ E, the follower has an action te, and the follower has a single additional action t0. The utility function for the leader is given by, for all θl ∈ Θl and all s ∈ S, u θl l (s, t0) = 1, and for all e ∈ E, u θl l (s, te) = 0. The followers utility is given by: • For all v ∈ V , for all e ∈ E with v /∈ e, uf (sv, te) = 1; • For all v ∈ V , for all e ∈ E with v ∈ e, uf (sv, te) = −K; • For all v ∈ V , uf (sv, t0) = 0. We claim that the leader can get a utility of 1 if and only if there is a solution to the VERTEX-COVER instance. First, suppose that there is a solution to the VERTEXCOVER instance. Then, the leader can commit to a pure strategy such that for each vertex v in the cover, the leader plays sv for some type. Then, the followers utility for playing te (for any e ∈ E) is at most K−1 K + 1 K (−K) = − 1 K , so that the follower will prefer to play t0, which gives the leader a utility of 1, as required. Now, suppose that there is a pure strategy for the leader that will give the leader a utility of 1. Then, the follower must play t0. In order for the follower not to prefer playing te (for any e ∈ E) instead, for at least one v ∈ e the leader must play sv for some type θl. Hence, the set of vertices v that the leader plays for some type must constitute a vertex cover; and this set can have size at most K, because the leader has only K types. So there is a solution to the VERTEXCOVER instance. However, if the leader has only a single type, then the problem becomes easy again (#types is the number of types for the follower): Theorem 6. In 2-player Bayesian games in which the leader has only a single type, an optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found in O(#outcomes · #types) time. Proof. For every leader action s, we can compute, for every follower type θf ∈ Θf , which actions t maximize the followers utility; call this set of actions BRθf (s). Then, the utility that the leader receives for committing to action s can be computed as θf ∈Θf π(θf ) maxt∈BRθf (s) ul(s, t), and the leader can choose the best action to commit to. 3.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In two-player zero-sum imperfect information games with perfect recall (no player ever forgets something that it once knew), a minimax strategy can be constructed in polynomial time [12, 13]. Unfortunately, this result does not extend to computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to in the general-sum case-not even in Bayesian games. We will exhibit NP-hardness by reducing from the INDEPENDENTSET problem. Definition 2. In INDEPENDENT-SET, we are given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. We are asked whether there exists a subset of the vertices S ⊆ V , with |S| = K, such that no edge e ∈ E has both of its endpoints in S. Again, this problem is NP-complete [9]. Theorem 7. Finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in 2-player Bayesian games is NP-hard, even when the leader has only a single type and the follower has only two actions. Proof. We reduce an arbitrary INDEPENDENT-SET instance to the following Bayesian game between the leader and the follower. The leader has only a single type, and for every vertex v ∈ V , the leader has an action sv. The follower has a type θv for every v ∈ V , occurring with probability 1 (|E|+1)|V | , and a type θe for every e ∈ E, occurring with probability 1 |E|+1 . The follower has two actions: t0 and t1. The leaders utility is given by, for all s ∈ S, ul(s, t0) = 1 and ul(s, t1) = 0. The followers utility is given by: • For all v ∈ V , uθv f (sv, t1) = 0; • For all v ∈ V and s ∈ S − {sv}, uθv f (s, t1) = K K−1 ; • For all v ∈ V and s ∈ S, uθv f (s, t0) = 1; • For all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, uθe f (s, t0) = 1; • For all e ∈ E, for both v ∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 2K 3 ; • For all e ∈ E, for all v /∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 0. We claim that an optimal strategy to commit to gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | if and only if there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance. First, suppose that there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance. Then, the leader could commit to the following strategy: for every vertex v in the independent set, play the corresponding sv with probability 1/K. If the follower has type θe for some e ∈ E, the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 is at most 1 K 2K 3 = 2/3, because there is at most one vertex v ∈ e such that sv is played with nonzero probability. Hence, the follower will play t0 and obtain a utility of 1. If the follower has type θv for some vertex v in the independent set, the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 is K−1 K K K−1 = 1, because the leader plays sv with probability 1/K. It follows that the follower (who breaks ties to maximize the leaders utility) will play t0, which also gives a utility of 1 and gives the leader a higher utility. Hence the leaders expected utility for this strategy is at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | , as required. 87 Now, suppose that there is a strategy that gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | . Then, this strategy must induce the follower to play t0 whenever it has a type of the form θe (because otherwise, the utility could be at most |E|−1 |E|+1 + |V | (|E|+1)|V | = |E| |E|+1 < |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | ). Thus, it cannot be the case that for some edge e = (v1, v2) ∈ E, the probability that the leader plays one of sv1 and sv2 is at least 2/K, because then the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 when it has type θe would be at least 2 K 2K 3 = 4/3 > 1. Moreover, the strategy must induce the follower to play t0 for at least K types of the form θv. Inducing the follower to play t0 when it has type θv can be done only by playing sv with probability at least 1/K, which will give the follower a utility of at most K−1 K K K−1 = 1 for playing t1. But then, the set of vertices v such that sv is played with probability at least 1/K must constitute an independent set of size K (because if there were an edge e between two such vertices, it would induce the follower to play t1 for type θe by the above). By contrast, if the follower has only a single type, then we can generalize the linear programming approach for normalform games: Theorem 8. In 2-player Bayesian games in which the follower has only a single type, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming. Proof. We generalize the approach in Theorem 2 as follows. For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader for every one of the leaders types such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders ex ante expected utility. To do so, we generalize the linear program as follows: maximize θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S pθl s uθl l (s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t) ≥ θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t ) for all θl ∈ Θl, s∈S p θl s = 1 As in Theorem 2, the solution for the linear program that maximizes the solution value is an optimal strategy to commit to. This shows an interesting contrast between commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in Bayesian games: for pure strategies, the problem becomes easy if the leader has only a single type (but not if the follower has only a single type), whereas for mixed strategies, the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single type (but not if the leader has only a single type). 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously. This requires some equilibrium notion (Nash equilibrium and its refinements), and often leads to the equilibrium selection problem: it is unclear to each individual player according to which equilibrium she should play. However, this model is not always realistic. In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision. For example, one agent may arrive at the (real or virtual) site of the game before the other, or, in the specific case of software agents, the code for one agent may be completed and committed before that of another agent. Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously. Specifically, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (optimal) commitment never hurts the leader, and often helps. The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position). In this paper, we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games. For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any number of players. An optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two players using linear programming (and no more efficiently than that, in the sense that any linear program with a probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of minimax strategies in normal-form games.) The problem becomes NP-hard for three (or more) players. In Bayesian games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the follower has only a single type, although two-player games in which the leader has only a single type can be solved efficiently. The problem of finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a Bayesian game is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the leader has only a single type, although two-player games in which the follower has only a single type can be solved efficiently using a generalization of the linear progamming approach for normal-form games. The following two tables summarize these results. 2 players ≥ 3 players normal-form O(#outcomes) O(#outcomes· #players) Bayesian, O(#outcomes· NP-hard 1-type leader #types) Bayesian, NP-hard NP-hard 1-type follower Bayesian (general) NP-hard NP-hard Results for commitment to pure strategies. (With more than 2 players, the follower is the last player to commit, the leader is the first.) 88 2 players ≥ 3 players normal-form one LP-solve per NP-hard follower action Bayesian, NP-hard NP-hard 1-type leader Bayesian, one LP-solve per NP-hard 1-type follower follower action Bayesian (general) NP-hard NP-hard Results for commitment to mixed strategies. (With more than 2 players, the follower is the last player to commit, the leader is the first.) Future research can take a number of directions. First, we can empirically evaluate the techniques presented here on test suites such as GAMUT [19]. We can also study the computation of optimal strategies to commit to in other1 concise representations of normal-form games-for example, in graphical games [10] or local-effect/action graph games [14, 1]. For the cases where computing an optimal strategy to commit to is NP-hard, we can also study the computation of approximately optimal strategies to commit to. While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing only approximately optimally. One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time. Another interesting direction to pursue is to see if computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us in, or otherwise shed light on, computing Nash equilibria. Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum games this is always true), although this is not always the case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy). 5.

UU. Conitzer@cs.cmu.edu tuomas Sandholm Carnegie Mellon University Ciencias de la Informática 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213, EE. UU.@cs.cmu.edu Resumen En sistemas múltiples, los entornos estratégicos a menudo se analizan bajo el supuesto de que los jugadores eligen sus estrategias simultáneamente. Sin embargo, este modelo no siempre es realista. En muchos entornos, un jugador puede comprometerse con una estrategia antes de que el otro jugador tome una decisión. Dichos modelos se conocen sinónimos como liderazgo, compromiso o modelos Stackelberg, y el juego óptimo en tales modelos a menudo es significativamente diferente del juego óptimo en el modelo donde las estrategias se seleccionan simultáneamente. El reciente aumento en el interés en calcular las soluciones teóricas del juego hasta ahora ha ignorado los modelos de liderazgo (con la excepción del interés en el diseño del mecanismo, donde el diseñador está implícitamente en una posición de liderazgo). En este artículo, estudiamos cómo calcular estrategias óptimas para comprometerse bajo el compromiso de las estrategias puras y el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas, tanto en los juegos de forma normal como bayesiana. Damos resultados positivos (algoritmos eficientes) y resultados negativos (resultados de np-endurecimiento).

Introducción en sistemas multiagentes con agentes egoístas (incluidas la mayoría de los entornos económicos), la acción óptima para que un agente tome depende de las acciones que toman los otros agentes. Para analizar cómo un agente debe comportarse en tales entornos, las herramientas de la teoría del juego deben aplicarse. Por lo general, cuando se modela una configuración estratégica en el marco de la teoría de juegos, se supone que los jugadores eligen sus estrategias simultáneamente. Esto es especialmente cierto cuando la configuración se modela como un juego de forma normal, que solo especifica la utilidad de cada agente en función del vector de estrategias que los agentes eligen, y no proporciona ninguna información sobre el orden en que los agentes toman sus decisionesy lo que los agentes observan sobre las decisiones anteriores de otros agentes. Dado que el juego se modela en forma normal, generalmente se analiza utilizando el concepto de equilibrio de Nash. Un equilibrio de Nash especifica una estrategia para cada jugador, de modo que ningún jugador tiene un incentivo para desviarse individualmente de este perfil de estrategias.(Por lo general, las estrategias pueden ser mezcladas, es decir, distribuciones de probabilidad sobre las estrategias originales (puras)). Se garantiza que un equilibrio NASH (estrategia mixta) existirá en juegos finitos [18], pero un problema es que puede haber múltiples equilibrios de Nash. Esto lleva al problema de selección de equilibrio de cómo un agente puede saber qué estrategia jugar si no sabe qué equilibrio se jugará. Cuando la configuración se modela como un juego de forma extensa, es posible especificar que algunos jugadores reciben información sobre las acciones tomadas por otras antes del juego antes de decidir sobre su acción. Sin embargo, en general, los jugadores no saben todo lo que sucedió anteriormente en el juego. Debido a esto, estos juegos suelen analizarse utilizando un concepto de equilibrio, donde se especifica una estrategia mixta para cada jugador, y requiere que la estrategia de cada jugador sea una mejor respuesta a las estrategias de las demás.(Por lo general, se impone una restricción adicional en las estrategias para garantizar que los jugadores no jueguen de una manera que sea irracional con respecto a la información que han recibido hasta ahora. Esto conduce a refinamientos del equilibrio de Nash, como el equilibrio de subjuego perfecto y secuencial). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, las estrategias no se seleccionan de tal manera simultánea. A menudo, un jugador (el líder) puede comprometerse con una estrategia ante otro jugador (el seguidor). Esto puede deberse a una variedad de razones. Por ejemplo, uno de los jugadores puede llegar al sitio en el que el juego se jugará ante otro agente (por ejemplo, en entornos económicos, un jugador puede ingresar a un mercado antes y comprometerse con una forma de hacer busi82). Tal poder de compromiso tiene un profundo impacto en cómo se debe jugar el juego. Por ejemplo, el líder puede ser mejor jugando una estrategia que esté dominada en la representación de forma normal del juego. Quizás el ejemplo más temprano y más conocido del efecto del compromiso es que por von Stackelberg [25], quien demostró que, en el modelo de duopolio de Cournots [5], si una empresa puede comprometerse primero con una cantidad de producción, esa empresaHaga mucho mejor que en la solución simultánea de movimiento (NASH). En general, si el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas es posible, entonces (bajo supuestos menores) nunca duele, y a menudo ayuda, a comprometerse con una estrategia [26]. Estar obligado a comprometerse con una estrategia pura a veces ayuda, y a veces duele (por ejemplo, comprometerse con una estrategia pura en los puestos de papel de roca antes de que la decisión de otros jugadores resultará naturalmente en una pérdida). En este documento, asumiremos que el compromiso siempre se ve forzado;Si no es así, el jugador que tiene la opción de comprometerse puede simplemente comparar el resultado de compromiso con el resultado de no comprometerse (simultáneo-movimiento). Los modelos de liderazgo son especialmente importantes en el entorno con múltiples agentes de software egoístas. Una vez que se finaliza el código para un agente (o para un equipo de agentes) y se implementa el agente, el agente se compromete a jugar la estrategia (posiblemente aleatoria) que prescribe el código. Por lo tanto, siempre que uno pueda mostrar de manera creíble que no se puede cambiar el código más adelante, el código sirve como un dispositivo de compromiso. Esto es cierto para los torneos recreativos entre los agentes (por ejemplo, torneos de póker, Robosoccer) y para aplicaciones industriales como las redes de sensores. Finalmente, también hay una situación de liderazgo implícita en el campo del diseño del mecanismo, en el que un jugador (el diseñador) puede elegir las reglas del juego que juegan los jugadores restantes. El diseño del mecanismo es un tema extremadamente importante para la comunidad de la CE: los documentos publicados sobre el diseño del mecanismo en las conferencias de la CE recientes son demasiado numerosos para citar. De hecho, el diseñador de mecanismo puede beneficiarse de comprometerse con una elección de que, si las acciones de los agentes (restantes) fueran fijos, sería subóptimo. Por ejemplo, en una subasta (de primer precio), el vendedor puede desear establecer un precio de reserva positivo (artificial) para el artículo, por debajo del cual el artículo no se venderá si el vendedor valora el artículo en 0. En retrospectiva (después de que hayan entrado las ofertas), esto (Na¨ıvely) parece subóptimo: si una oferta superior al precio de la reserva llegó, el precio de la reserva no tuvo efecto, y si no llegara dicha oferta, el vendedor habría sidoMejor aceptar una oferta más baja. Por supuesto, la razón para establecer el precio de reserva es que incentiva a los postores a ofertar más alto, y debido a esto, establecer precios de reserva artificial en realidad puede aumentar los ingresos esperados al vendedor. Recientemente se ha dedicado una cantidad significativa de investigación al cálculo de soluciones de acuerdo con varios conceptos de solución para entornos en los que los agentes eligen sus estrategias simultáneamente, como el dominio [7, 11, 3] y (especialmente) el equilibrio NASH [8, 21, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4]. Sin embargo, el cálculo de la estrategia óptima para comprometerse en una situación de liderazgo ha sido ignorado. Teóricamente, las situaciones de liderazgo simplemente pueden considerarse como un juego de forma extensa en el que un jugador elige primero una estrategia (para el juego original). Sin embargo, el número de estrategias en este juego de forma extensa puede ser extremadamente grande. Por ejemplo, si el líder puede comprometerse con una estrategia mixta en el juego original, entonces cada una de las (continuas) estrategias mixtas constituye una estrategia pura en la representación extensa de la situación de liderazgo.(Observamos que un compromiso con una distribución no es lo mismo que una distribución sobre los compromisos). Además, si el juego original es en sí mismo un juego de forma extensa, el número de estrategias en la representación extensa de la situación de liderazgo (que es un juego de forma extensa diferente) se hace aún más grande. Debido a esto, generalmente no es computacionalmente factible simplemente transformar el juego original en la representación extensa de la situación de liderazgo;En cambio, tenemos que analizar el juego en su representación original. En este documento, estudiamos cómo calcular la estrategia óptima para comprometerse, tanto en los juegos de forma normal (sección 2) como en los juegos bayesianos, que son un caso especial de juegos extensos (Sección 3).2. Juegos de forma normal En esta sección, estudiamos cómo calcular la estrategia óptima para comprometerse para los juegos representados en forma normal.2.1 Definiciones en un juego de forma normal, cada jugador i ∈ {1 ,..., n} tiene un conjunto de estrategias puras (o acciones) Si, y una función de utilidad UI: S1 × S2 ×... × Sn → R que mapea cada resultado (un vector que consiste en una estrategia pura para cada jugador, también conocido como perfil de estrategias puras) a un número real. Para aliviar la notación, en el caso de dos jugadores, nos referiremos al conjunto de estrategia pura del Jugador 1 como S, y la estrategia pura del jugador 2 set como T. Tales juegos pueden representarse en la forma (bi-) de matriz, en la que corresponden las filasPara las estrategias puras del Jugador 1, las columnas corresponden a las estrategias puras del jugador 2S, y las entradas de la matriz dan a las utilidades de los jugadores de fila y columna (en ese orden) para el resultado correspondiente del juego. En el caso de tres jugadores, usaremos R, S y T, para las estrategias puras del jugador 1, 2 y 3S, respectivamente. Una estrategia mixta para un jugador es una distribución de probabilidad sobre las estrategias puras de los jugadores. En el caso de los juegos de dos jugadores, nos referiremos al jugador 1 como el líder y el jugador 2 como el seguidor. Antes de definir estrategias de liderazgo óptimas, considere el siguiente juego que ilustra el efecto de la capacidad de los líderes para comprometerse.2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 En esta representación de forma normal, la estrategia inferior para el jugador de fila está estrictamente dominada por la estrategia superior. Sin embargo, si el jugador de fila tiene la capacidad de comprometerse con una estrategia pura antes de que el jugador de columna elija su estrategia, el jugador de fila debe comprometerse con la estrategia inferior: hacerlo hará que el jugador de columna prefiera jugar la estrategia correcta, lo que lleva a unUtilidad de 3 para el jugador de fila. Por el contrario, si el jugador de filas se comprometiera con la estrategia superior, el reproductor de columna preferiría jugar la estrategia de izquierda, lo que lleva a una utilidad de solo 2 para el jugador de filas. Si el reproductor de filas puede comprometerse con una estrategia mixta, entonces puede obtener una utilidad (esperada) aún mayor: si el reproductor de filas se compromete a colocar la probabilidad p> 1/2 en la estrategia inferior, entonces el reproductor de columna aún preferiráPara jugar la estrategia correcta, y la utilidad esperada de los jugadores de fila será 3p + 4 (1 - p) = 4 - p ≥ 3. Si el reproductor de filas juega cada estrategia con probabilidad exactamente 1/2, el reproductor de columna es 83 indiferente entre las estrategias. En tales casos, asumiremos que el reproductor de columnas elegirá la estrategia que maximiza la utilidad de los jugadores de fila (en este caso, la estrategia correcta). Por lo tanto, la estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse para el reproductor de filas es p = 1/2. Hay algunas buenas razones para esta suposición. Si asumiéramos lo contrario, entonces no existiría una estrategia óptima para el jugador de fila en el juego de ejemplo: el jugador de fila jugaría la estrategia inferior con probabilidad p = 1/2 + con> 0, y cuanto más pequeña, la más pequeña, laMejor la utilidad para el jugador de filas. Por el contrario, si suponemos que el seguidor siempre rompe los lazos en el favor de los líderes, entonces siempre existe una estrategia mixta óptima para el líder, y esto corresponde a un equilibrio perfecto del subjuego perfecto de la representación extensa de la situación de liderazgo. En cualquier caso, esta es una suposición estándar para tales modelos (por ejemplo, [20]), aunque algún trabajo ha investigado lo que puede suceder en el otro subjuego Equilibrios perfecto [26].(Para los juegos genéricos de dos jugadores, el pago de equilibrio perfecto de los líderes es único). Además, la misma suposición se usa típicamente en el diseño del mecanismo, ya que se supone que si un agente es indiferente entre revelar sus preferencias sinceramente y revelarlas falsamente, los informará sinceramente. Dada esta suposición, podemos referirnos de manera segura a estrategias de liderazgo óptimas en lugar de tener que usar alguna noción de equilibrio. Por lo tanto, para los propósitos de este documento, una estrategia óptima para comprometerse en un juego de 2 jugadores es una estrategia s ∈ S que maximiza Maxt∈Br (S) Ul (S, T), donde BR (S) = Arg Maxt∈T uf (s, t).(UL y UF son las funciones de utilidad líderes y seguidores, respectivamente). Podemos tener S = s para el caso de compromiso con estrategias puras, o s = ∆ (s), el conjunto de distribuciones de probabilidad sobre S, para el caso de compromiso con estrategias mixtas.(Observamos que reemplazar t por ∆ (t) no hace ninguna diferencia en esta definición). Para los juegos con más de dos jugadores, en los que los jugadores se comprometen con sus estrategias en secuencia, definimos estrategias óptimas para comprometerse con recursivamente. Después de que el líder se comprometa con una estrategia, el juego que debe jugar por los agentes restantes es en sí mismo un juego de liderazgo (más pequeño). Por lo tanto, definimos una estrategia óptima para comprometerse como una estrategia que maximiza la utilidad de los líderes, suponiendo que el juego de los agentes restantes es óptimo bajo esta definición, y maximiza la utilidad de los líderes entre todas las formas óptimas de jugar el juego restante. Una vez más, el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas puede o no ser una posibilidad para cada jugador (aunque para el último jugador no importa si permitimos el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas).2.2 Compromiso con estrategias puras Primero estudiamos cómo calcular la estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse. Esto es relativamente simple, porque el número de estrategias para comprometerse no es muy grande.(A continuación, #Outcomes es el número de perfiles de estrategia completos). Teorema 1. En compromiso con las estrategias puras, el conjunto de todos los perfiles de estrategia óptimos en un juego de forma normal se puede encontrar en el tiempo O (#Players · #Outcomes). Prueba. Cada estrategia pura que el primer jugador puede comprometerse inducirá un subjuego para los jugadores restantes. Podemos resolver cada uno de esos subgame recursivamente para encontrar todos sus perfiles de estrategia óptimos;Cada uno de estos le dará al líder original algo de utilidad. Aquellos que le dan al líder la utilidad máxima corresponden exactamente a los perfiles de estrategia óptimos del juego original. Ahora presentamos el algoritmo formalmente. Deje que Su (G, S1) sea el subjuego que resulta después del primer jugador (restante) en G juega S1 ∈ Sg 1. Un juego con 0 jugadores es simplemente un resultado del juego. La función Añve (S, O) agrega la estrategia s a cada uno de los vectores de estrategias en el conjunto O. Sea E el vector vacío sin elementos. En un ligero abuso de notación, escribiremos UG 1 (c) cuando todos los perfiles de estrategia en el set C dan al jugador 1 la misma utilidad en el juego G. (aquí, el jugador 1 es el primer jugador restante en el subjuego G, nonecesariamente jugador 1 en el juego original). Observamos que Arg Max tiene valor establecido. Luego, el siguiente algoritmo calcula todos los perfiles de estrategia óptimos: algoritmo resolver (g) Si G tiene 0 jugadores return {e} c ← ∅ para todos s1 ∈ Sg 1 {o ← solve (su (g, s1)) o ← arg maxo∈O UG 1 (S1, O) si C = ∅ o UG 1 (S1, O) = UG 1 (C) C ← C∪append (S1, O) Si UG 1 (S1, O)> UG 1 (C) C ← Append (s1, o)} return c Cada resultado es (potencialmente) examinado por cada jugador, lo que conduce al límite de tiempo de ejecución dado. Como ejemplo de cómo funciona el algoritmo, considere el siguiente juego de 3 jugadores, en el que el primer jugador elige la matriz izquierda o derecha, el segundo jugador elige una fila y el tercer jugador elige una columna.0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,00,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 Primero eliminamos los resultados que no corresponden aLas mejores respuestas para el tercer jugador (eliminarlos de la matriz): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4, 4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 A continuación, eliminamos las entradas en las que el tercer jugador no rompe los lazos a favor del segundo jugador, así como entradas que no corresponden a las mejores respuestas para la segundajugador.0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finalmente, eliminamos las entradas en las que los jugadores segundo y tercero no rompen los lazos a favor del primer jugador, así como entradas que síno corresponde a las mejores respuestas para el primer jugador.2,1,1 84 Por lo tanto, en un juego óptimo, el primer jugador elige la matriz izquierda, el segundo jugador elige la fila central y el tercer jugador elige la columna izquierda.(Notamos que este resultado está dominado por Pareto por (derecho, medio, izquierda).). Para los juegos generales de forma normal, cada utilidad de los jugadores para cada uno de los resultados debe representarse explícitamente en la entrada, de modo que el tamaño de entrada es en sí mismo Ω (#Players · #Outcomes). Por lo tanto, el algoritmo es, de hecho, un algoritmo de tiempo lineal.2.3 Compromiso con estrategias mixtas en el caso especial de los juegos de dos jugadores de suma cero, calcular una estrategia mixta óptima para que el líder se comprometa es equivalente a calcular una estrategia Minimax, que minimiza la utilidad máxima esperada que el oponente puede obtener. Las estrategias Minimax constituyen el único concepto de solución natural para los juegos de dos jugadores de suma cero: Von Neumanns Minimax Theorem [24] establece que en los juegos de dos jugadores cero, no importa (en términos de las utilidades de los jugadores) que el jugador obtienePrimero comprometerse con una estrategia mixta, y un perfil de estrategias mixtas es un equilibrio de Nash si y solo si ambas estrategias son estrategias Minimax. Es bien sabido que se puede encontrar una estrategia Minax en el tiempo polinomial, utilizando programación lineal [17]. Nuestro primer resultado en esta sección generaliza este resultado, lo que demuestra que una estrategia mixta óptima para el líder puede comprometerse puede calcularse de manera eficiente en los juegos de dos jugadores de suma general, nuevamente utilizando programación lineal. Teorema 2. En los juegos de forma normal de 2 jugadores, una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse se puede encontrar en el tiempo polinomial utilizando programación lineal. Prueba. Para cada estrategia de seguidor puro T, calculamos una estrategia mixta para el líder de tal manera que 1) jugar T es una mejor respuesta para el seguidor, y 2) bajo esta restricción, la estrategia mixta maximiza la utilidad de los líderes. Dicha estrategia mixta se puede calcular utilizando el siguiente programa lineal simple: maximizar s∈S psul (s, t) sujeto a todos t ∈ T, s∈S psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈S psuf (s, t) S∈S PS = 1 Observamos que este programa puede ser inviable para algunas estrategias de seguidor t, por ejemplo, si T es una estrategia estrictamente dominada. Sin embargo, el programa debe ser factible para al menos algunas estrategias de seguidores;Entre estas estrategias de seguidor, elija una estrategia t ∗ que maximice el valor de la solución de programas lineales. Luego, si el líder elige como su estrategia mixta, la configuración óptima de las variables PS para el programa lineal para T ∗, y el seguidor juega T ∗, esto constituye un perfil de estrategia óptimo. En el siguiente resultado, mostramos que no podemos esperar resolver el problema de manera más eficiente que la programación lineal, porque podemos reducir cualquier programa lineal con una restricción de probabilidad en sus variables a un problema de calcular la estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en un 2-El juego de formato normal. Teorema 3. Cualquier programa lineal cuyas variables xi (con xi ∈ R≥0) debe satsify i xi = 1 puede modelarse como un problema para calcular la estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en un juego de forma normal de 2 jugadores. Prueba. Deje que el líder tenga una estrategia pura I para cada variable XI. Deje que el reproductor de columnas tenga una estrategia pura j para cada restricción en el programa lineal (que no sea i xi = 1), y una sola estrategia pura adicional 0. Deje que las funciones de utilidad sean las siguientes. Escribir el objetivo del programa lineal como Maximizar i CIXI, para cualquier I, deje ul (i, 0) = ci y uf (i, 0) = 0. Escribir la restricción JTH del programa lineal (sin incluir i xi = 1) como i aijxi ≤ bj, para cualquier i, j> 0, que ul (i, j) = mini ci - 1 y uf (i, j) = =aij - bj. Por ejemplo, considere el siguiente programa lineal.Maximice 2x1 + x2 sujeto a x1 + x2 = 1 5x1 + 2x2 ≤ 3 7x1 - 2x2 ≤ 2 La solución óptima a este programa es x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3. Nuestra reducción transforma este programa en el siguiente juego de líder del líder (donde el líder es el jugador de filas).2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 De hecho, la estrategia óptima para el líder es jugar la estrategia superior con la probabilidad 1/3 y la estrategia inferior con probabilidad 2/3. Ahora mostramos que la reducción funciona en general. Claramente, el líder quiere incentivar al seguidor a jugar 0, porque la utilidad que el líder obtiene cuando el seguidor juega 0 siempre es mayor que cuando el seguidor no juega 0. Para que el seguidor no prefiera jugar j> 0 en lugar de 0, debe ser el caso de que I pl (i) (aij - bj) ≤ 0, o de manera equivalente i pl (i) aij ≤ bj. Por lo tanto, el líder obtendrá una utilidad de al menos mini CI si y solo si hay una solución factible a las limitaciones. Dado que el PL (i) incentiva al seguidor para jugar 0, el líder intenta maximizar i pl (i) Ci. Por lo tanto, el líder debe resolver el programa lineal original. Como prueba alternativa del teorema 3, uno puede observar que se sabe que encontrar una estrategia Minimax en un juego de Zerosum es tan difícil como el problema de programación lineal [6], y como señalamos al comienzo de esta sección, calculando unLa estrategia Minimax en un juego de suma cero es un caso especial del problema de calcular una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse. Esta solvabilidad en tiempo polinómico del problema de calcular una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en los juegos de dos jugadores en forma normal contrasta con la complejidad desconocida de calcular un equilibrio NASH en tales juegos [21], así como con la enduría NP.de encontrar un equilibrio de Nash con máxima utilidad para un jugador determinado en tales juegos [8, 2]. Desafortunadamente, este resultado no se generaliza a más de dos jugadores, cuando el problema se vuelve np-hard. Para mostrar esto, reducimos del problema de cobertura de vértice. Definición 1. En la cubierta de vértice, se nos da un gráfico g = (v, e) y un entero K. Se nos pregunta si 85 existe un subconjunto de los vértices S ⊆ V, con | S |= K, de modo que cada borde e ∈ E tiene al menos uno de sus puntos finales en S. Balanced-Vértice-cubo es el caso especial de la cubierta de vértice en el que k = | V |/2. El tope de vértice es NP-completado [9]. El siguiente lema muestra que la dureza permanece si requerimos k = | v |/2.(Se han demostrado resultados similares para otros problemas completos de NP). Lema 1. La cobertura de vérteos equilibrados es NP-Completo. Prueba. La membresía en NP se deduce del hecho de que el problema es un caso especial de cubierta de vértice, que está en NP. Para mostrar NP-Hardness, reducimos una instancia arbitraria de cobertura de vértice a una instancia de vertexcover equilibrado, como sigue. Si, para la instancia de cubierta de vértice, k> | v |/2, simplemente agregamos vértices aislados que son disjuntos del resto del gráfico, hasta que k = | V |/2. Si K <| V |/2, agregamos triángulos aislados (es decir, el gráfico completo en tres vértices) al gráfico, aumentando K por 2 cada vez, hasta que K = | V |/2. Teorema 4. En los juegos de forma normal de 3 jugadores, encontrar una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse es NP-Hard. Prueba. Reducimos una instancia arbitraria de Viexcover equilibrado al siguiente juego de forma normal de 3 jugadores. Para cada vértice V, cada uno de los tres jugadores tiene una estrategia pura correspondiente a ese vértice (RV, SV, TV, respectivamente). Además, por cada borde E, el tercer jugador tiene una estrategia pura TE;Y finalmente, el tercer jugador tiene una estrategia pura adicional T0. Las utilidades son las siguientes: • Para todos r ∈ R, S ∈ S, U1 (R, S, T0) = U2 (R, S, T0) = 1;• Para todos r ∈ R, s ∈ S, t ∈ T− {t0}, u1 (r, s, t) = u2 (r, s, t) = 0;• Para todos los v ∈ V, S ∈ S, U3 (RV, S, TV) = 0;• Para todos v ∈ V, r ∈ R, u3 (r, sv, tv) = 0;• Para todos v ∈ V, para todos r ∈ R - {rv}, s ∈ S - {sv}, u3 (r, s, tv) = | v || V | −2;• Para todos los e ∈ E, s ∈ S, para ambos v ∈ E, U3 (rv, s, te) = 0;• Para todos los e ∈ E, s ∈ S, para todos v /∈ E, U3 (rv, s, te) = | v || V | −2.• Para todos r ∈ R, S ∈ S, U3 (R, S, T0) = 1. Observamos que los jugadores 1 y 2 tienen la misma función de utilidad. Afirmamos que existe un perfil de estrategia óptimo en el que los jugadores 1 y 2 obtienen 1 (su utilidad máxima) si y solo si hay una solución al problema equilibrado-vertexcover.(De lo contrario, estos jugadores obtendrán 0.) Primero, supongamos que existe una solución al problema Balancedvertex-Cover. Luego, deje que el Jugador 1 juegue cada RV de tal manera que V esté en la portada con probabilidad 2 | V |y deje que el jugador 2 juegue cada SV de tal manera que V no esté en la portada con probabilidad 2 | V |. Luego, para el Jugador 3, la utilidad esperada de reproducir televisión (para cualquier V) es (1 - 2 | V |) | V || V | −2 = 1, porque hay una posibilidad de 2 | V |Ese RV o SV se juega. Además, la utilidad esperada de jugar TE (para cualquier e) es como máximo (1 - 2 | V |) | V || V | −2 = 1, porque hay una posibilidad de al menos 2 | V |que se juega un RV con V ∈ E (porque el jugador 1 es aleatorizar sobre las estrategias puras correspondientes a la cubierta). Se deduce que jugar T0 es una mejor respuesta para el jugador 3, dando a los jugadores 1 y 2 una utilidad de 1. Ahora, suponga que los jugadores 1 y 2 obtienen 1 en un juego óptimo. Entonces, debe ser el caso que el jugador 3 juegue T0. Por lo tanto, por cada v ∈ V, debe haber una probabilidad de al menos 2 | V |que se juega RV o SV, ya que de lo contrario el jugador 3 sería mejor jugar televisión. Debido a que los jugadores 1 y 2 tienen solo una probabilidad total de 2 para distribuir, debe ser el caso de que para cada V, RV o SV se jueguen con probabilidad 2 | V |, y el otro se juega con probabilidad 0. (no es posible que ambos tengan una probabilidad distinta de cero, porque entonces habría cierta probabilidad de que ambos se jueguen simultáneamente (la correlación no es posible), de ahí la probabilidad total de que al menos uno seaJugar no podría ser lo suficientemente alto para todos los vértices). Por lo tanto, para exactamente la mitad del V ∈ V, el jugador 1 coloca la probabilidad 2 | V |en RV. Además, por cada e ∈ E, debe haber una probabilidad de al menos 2 | V |Que se juega un RV con V ∈ E, ya que de lo contrario el jugador 3 sería mejor jugar TE. Por lo tanto, el v ∈ V tal que el jugador 1 coloca probabilidad 2 | V |en RV constituyen una cubierta de vértice equilibrada.3. Juegos bayesianos Hasta ahora, hemos restringido nuestra atención a los juegos de forma normal. En un juego de forma normal, se supone que cada agente conoce a todos los demás agentes preferencias sobre los resultados del juego. En general, sin embargo, los agentes pueden tener información privada sobre sus preferencias que no conocen los otros agentes. Además, en el momento del compromiso con una estrategia, los agentes pueden no conocer sus propias preferencias (finales) sobre los resultados del juego todavía, porque estas preferencias pueden depender de un contexto que aún no se ha materializado. Por ejemplo, cuando se escribe el código para un agente comercial, es posible que aún no esté claro cómo ese agente valorará los recursos que negociará más adelante, porque esto depende de la información que aún no esté disponible en el momento en que el código estáescrito (como órdenes que se habrán realizado al agente antes de la negociación). En esta sección, estudiaremos el compromiso en los juegos bayesianos, que pueden modelar tal incertidumbre sobre las preferencias.3.1 Definiciones En un juego bayesiano, cada jugador I tiene un conjunto de acciones si, un conjunto de tipos θi con una distribución de probabilidad asociada πi: θi → [0, 1] y, para cada tipo θi, una función de utilidad uθi i:S1 × S2 ×...× Sn → R. Una estrategia pura en un juego bayesiano es un mapeo de los tipos de jugadores a acciones, σi: θi → Si.(Los juegos bayesianos se pueden reescribir en forma normal en enumerar cada estrategia pura σi, pero esto causará una explosión exponencial en el tamaño de la representación del juego y, por lo tanto, no puede conducir a algoritmos eficientes). La estrategia con la que debería comprometerse el líder depende de si, en el momento del compromiso, el líder conoce su propio tipo. Si el líder conoce su propio tipo, los otros tipos que el líder podría haberse vuelto irrelevante y el líder simplemente debería comprometerse con la estrategia que es óptima para el tipo. Sin embargo, como se argumentó anteriormente, el líder no necesariamente conoce su propio tipo en el momento del compromiso (por ejemplo, el momento en que se presenta el código). En este caso, el líder debe comprometerse con una estrategia que dependa del tipo eventual de los líderes. Estudiaremos este último modelo, aunque prestaremos atención específica al caso donde el líder solo tiene un tipo único, que es efectivamente lo mismo que el antiguo modelo.3.2 Compromiso con estrategias puras resulta que calcular una estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse es difícil en los juegos bayesianos, incluso con dos jugadores. Teorema 5. Encontrar una estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse en los juegos bayesianos de 2 jugadores es NP-Hard, incluso cuando el seguidor tiene solo un tipo. Prueba. Reducimos una instancia arbitraria de cubierta de vértice al siguiente juego bayesiano entre el líder y el seguidor. El líder tiene k tipos θ1, θ2 ,..., θk, cada uno con probabilidad 1/k, y para cada vértice v ∈ V, el líder tiene una acción sv. El seguidor tiene solo un tipo;Para cada borde e ∈ E, el seguidor tiene una acción TE, y el seguidor tiene una sola acción adicional T0. La función de utilidad para el líder viene dada por todo θl ∈ θl y todos s ∈ S, u θl l (s, t0) = 1, y para todos e ∈ E, u θl l (s, te) = 0. La utilidad de los seguidores viene dada por: • Para todas las v ∈ V, para todas e ∈ E con v /∈ E, UF (SV, TE) = 1;• Para todos v ∈ V, para todos e ∈ E con V ∈ E, UF (SV, TE) = −K;• Para todos v ∈ V, UF (SV, T0) = 0. Afirmamos que el líder puede obtener una utilidad de 1 si y solo si hay una solución a la instancia de cobertura de vértice. Primero, suponga que hay una solución a la instancia de VertexCover. Entonces, el líder puede comprometerse con una estrategia pura tal que para cada vértice V en la portada, el líder juega SV para algún tipo. Luego, la utilidad de los seguidores para jugar TE (para cualquier e ∈ E) es como máximo k - 1 k + 1 k (−k) = - 1 k, de modo que el seguidor preferirá jugar T0, lo que le da al líder una utilidad una utilidadde 1, según sea necesario. Ahora, suponga que existe una estrategia pura para el líder que le dará al líder una utilidad de 1. Entonces, el seguidor debe jugar T0. Para que el seguidor no prefiera jugar TE (para cualquier e ∈ E) en su lugar, al menos una v ∈ E, el líder debe jugar SV para algún tipo θl. Por lo tanto, el conjunto de vértices v que el líder juega para algún tipo debe constituir una cubierta de vértice;Y este conjunto puede tener un tamaño en la máximo de K, porque el líder solo tiene k tipos. Por lo tanto, hay una solución a la instancia de VertexCover. Sin embargo, si el líder tiene solo un tipo, entonces el problema vuelve a ser fácil (#Types es el número de tipos para el seguidor): Teorema 6. En los juegos bayesianos de 2 jugadores en los que el líder tiene un solo tipo, se puede encontrar una estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse en el tiempo O (#Outcomes · #Types). Prueba. Para cada acción del líder, podemos calcular, para cada tipo de seguidor θf ∈ θf, que las acciones t maximizan la utilidad de los seguidores;Llame a este conjunto de acciones brθf (s). Luego, la utilidad que recibe el líder para comprometerse a la acción s se puede calcular como θf ∈ obtener3.3 Compromiso con estrategias mixtas en juegos de información imperfectos de suma cero de dos jugadores con un retiro perfecto (ningún jugador olvida algo que alguna vez sabía), una estrategia Minax se puede construir en tiempo polinomial [12, 13]. Desafortunadamente, este resultado no se extiende a calcular estrategias mixtas óptimas para comprometerse en el caso de suma general, no en los juegos bayesianos. Exhibiremos la duración de NP reduciendo el problema del conjunto de independientes. Definición 2. En el conjunto independiente, se nos da un gráfico g = (v, e) y un entero K. Se nos pregunta si existe un subconjunto de los vértices S ⊆ V, con | S |= K, de modo que ningún borde e ∈ E tiene ambos puntos finales en S. Una vez más, este problema es NP-completado [9]. Teorema 7. Encontrar una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en juegos bayesianos de 2 jugadores es NP-Hard, incluso cuando el líder solo tiene un tipo de tipo y el seguidor solo tiene dos acciones. Prueba. Reducimos una instancia arbitraria de conjunto independiente al siguiente juego bayesiano entre el líder y el seguidor. El líder tiene un solo tipo, y para cada vértice v ∈ V, el líder tiene una acción sv. El seguidor tiene un tipo θv para cada v ∈ V, que ocurre con la probabilidad 1 (| E | +1) | V |, y un tipo θe para cada e ∈ E, que ocurre con probabilidad 1 | e | +1. El seguidor tiene dos acciones: T0 y T1. La utilidad de los líderes viene dada por, para todos los s ∈ S, UL (S, T0) = 1 y UL (S, T1) = 0. La utilidad de los seguidores viene dada por: • Para todos los v ∈ V, uθv f (sv, t1) = 0;• Para todos los v ∈ V y S ∈ S - {Sv}, uθv f (s, t1) = k k - 1;• Para todos los v ∈ V y S ∈ S, uθv f (s, t0) = 1;• Para todos los e ∈ E, s ∈ S, uθe f (s, t0) = 1;• Para todos los e ∈ E, para ambos v ∈ E, Uθe f (SV, T1) = 2K 3;• Para todos los e ∈ E, para todos v /∈ E, uθe f (sv, t1) = 0. Afirmamos que una estrategia óptima para comprometerse le da al líder una utilidad esperada de al menos | E || E | +1+K (| E | +1) | V |si y solo si hay una solución a la instancia de set independiente. Primero, suponga que hay una solución a la instancia de set independiente. Luego, el líder podría comprometerse con la siguiente estrategia: para cada vértice V en el conjunto independiente, juegue el SV correspondiente con probabilidad 1/k. Si el seguidor tiene el tipo θe para algunos e ∈ E, la utilidad esperada para el seguidor de jugar T1 es como máximo 1 k 2k 3 = 2/3, porque hay como máximo un vértice v ∈ E de modo que SV se juega con nonue ceroprobabilidad. Por lo tanto, el seguidor jugará T0 y obtendrá una utilidad de 1. Si el seguidor tiene el tipo θV para algún vértice V en el conjunto independiente, la utilidad esperada para el seguidor de jugar T1 es K - 1 K K - 1 = 1, porque el líder juega SV con probabilidad 1/K. Se deduce que el seguidor (que rompe los lazos para maximizar la utilidad de los líderes) jugará T0, lo que también le da una utilidad de 1 y le da al líder una mayor utilidad. Por lo tanto, la utilidad esperada de los líderes para esta estrategia es al menos | E || E | +1+K (| E | +1) | V |, según sea necesario.87 Ahora, supongamos que existe una estrategia que le da al líder una utilidad esperada de al menos | E || E | +1+K (| E | +1) | V |. Luego, esta estrategia debe inducir al seguidor a jugar T0 siempre que tenga un tipo de forma θe (porque de lo contrario, la utilidad podría ser como máximo | E | −1 | E | +1+| V | (| E | +1) | V | = | E | | E | +1 <| E | | E | +1+K (| E | +1) | V |). Por lo tanto, no puede ser el caso de que para algún borde e = (v1, v2) ∈ E, la probabilidad de que el líder juegue uno de SV1 y SV2 es al menos 2/k, porque entonces la utilidad esperada para el seguidor de jugar T1Cuando tiene el tipo θe sería al menos 2 k 2k 3 = 4/3> 1. Además, la estrategia debe inducir al seguidor a jugar T0 para al menos k tipos de la forma θv. Inducir al seguidor a jugar T0 cuando tiene el tipo θv solo se puede hacer jugando SV con probabilidad al menos 1/K, lo que le dará al seguidor una utilidad de como máximo K - 1 K K - 1 = 1 para jugar T1. Pero entonces, el conjunto de vértices v de tal manera que SV se juega con probabilidad al menos 1/K debe constituir un conjunto independiente de tamaño K (porque si hubiera un borde E entre dos de estos vértices, induciría que el seguidor juegue T1tipo θe por lo anterior). Por el contrario, si el seguidor tiene solo un tipo, entonces podemos generalizar el enfoque de programación lineal para los juegos normales de forma normal: Teorema 8. En los juegos bayesianos de 2 jugadores en los que el seguidor tiene solo un tipo, una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse se puede encontrar en el tiempo polinomial utilizando la programación lineal. Prueba. Generalizamos el enfoque en el Teorema 2 de la siguiente manera. Para cada estrategia de seguidor puro T, calculamos una estrategia mixta para el líder para cada uno de los tipos de líderes de tal manera que 1) jugar T es una mejor respuesta para el seguidor, y 2) bajo esta restricción, la estrategia mixta maximiza los líderes exAnte la utilidad esperada. Para hacerlo, generalizamos el programa lineal de la siguiente manera: maximizar θl∈θl π (θl) s∈S pθl s uθl l (s, t) sujeto a todos t ∈ T, θl∈θl π (θl) s∈Sp θl S UF (S, T) ≥ θl∈θl π (θl) S∈S P θl S UF (S, T) para todos θl ∈ θl, S∈S p θl S = 1 como en el teorema 2, la soluciónPara el programa lineal que maximiza el valor de la solución es una estrategia óptima para comprometerse. Esto muestra un contraste interesante entre el compromiso con las estrategias puras y el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas en los juegos bayesianos: para las estrategias puras, el problema se vuelve fácil si el líder solo tiene un tipo (pero no si el seguidor tiene solo un tipo), mientras queEstrategias mixtas, el problema se vuelve fácil si el seguidor tiene solo un tipo (pero no si el líder tiene solo un tipo).4. Conclusiones e investigaciones futuras en sistemas múltiples, los entornos estratégicos a menudo se analizan bajo el supuesto de que los jugadores eligen sus estrategias simultáneamente. Esto requiere cierta noción de equilibrio (equilibrio de Nash y sus refinamientos), y a menudo conduce al problema de selección de equilibrio: no está claro para cada jugador individual según qué equilibrio debe jugar. Sin embargo, este modelo no siempre es realista. En muchos entornos, un jugador puede comprometerse con una estrategia antes de que el otro jugador tome una decisión. Por ejemplo, un agente puede llegar al sitio (real o virtual) del juego antes que el otro, o, en el caso específico de los agentes de software, el código para un agente puede completarse y cometirse antes del de otro agente. Dichos modelos se conocen sinónimos como liderazgo, compromiso o modelos Stackelberg, y el juego óptimo en tales modelos a menudo es significativamente diferente del juego óptimo en el modelo donde las estrategias se seleccionan simultáneamente. Específicamente, si el compromiso con estrategias mixtas es posible, entonces el compromiso (óptimo) nunca hace daño al líder, y a menudo ayuda. El reciente aumento en el interés en calcular las soluciones teóricas del juego hasta ahora ha ignorado los modelos de liderazgo (con la excepción del interés en el diseño del mecanismo, donde el diseñador está implícitamente en una posición de liderazgo). En este documento, estudiamos cómo calcular estrategias óptimas para comprometerse bajo el compromiso de las estrategias puras y el compromiso con las estrategias mixtas, tanto en los juegos de forma normal como bayesiana. Para los juegos de forma normal, demostramos que la estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse se puede encontrar de manera eficiente para cualquier número de jugadores. Una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en un juego de forma normal se puede encontrar de manera eficiente para dos jugadores que usan programación lineal (y no más eficientemente que eso, en el sentido de que cualquier programa lineal con una restricción de probabilidad puede codificarse como tal problema).(Esta es una generalización de la computabilidad en tiempo polinómico de las estrategias Minimax en los juegos de forma normal). El problema se convierte en NP-Hard para tres (o más) jugadores. En los juegos bayesianos, el problema de encontrar una estrategia pura óptima con la que comprometerse es NP-Hard incluso en juegos de dos jugadores en los que el seguidor tiene solo un tipo de tipo, aunque los juegos de dos jugadores en los que el líder tiene solo un tipo de lata.ser resuelto de manera eficiente. El problema de encontrar una estrategia mixta óptima para comprometerse en un juego bayesiano es NP-Hard incluso en juegos de dos jugadores en los que el líder tiene solo un tipo de tipo, aunque los juegos de dos jugadores en los que el seguidor tiene solo un tipo CAN CAN Can.se resuelve eficientemente utilizando una generalización del enfoque de progamming lineal para los juegos de forma normal. Las siguientes dos tablas resumen estos resultados.2 jugadores ≥ 3 jugadores Forma normal O (#Outcomes) O (#Resultados · #Players) Bayesian, O (#Resultados · Líder de tipo 1-Hard 1 #Types) bayesiano, np-hard np-hard 1-tipo 1Resultados bayesianos (generales) NP-Hard NP-Hard para compromiso con estrategias puras.(Con más de 2 jugadores, el seguidor es el último jugador en comprometerse, el líder es el primero). 88 2 jugadores ≥ 3 jugadores Forma normal Un LP-Solve por seguidor de NP-Hard Action Bayesian, NP-Hard-HardLíder de 1 tipo Bayesian, un LP-Solve por NP-Hard 1-Type Seguidor de seguidores de seguidores Bayesian (General) NP-Hard NP-Hard-Hard para comprometerse con estrategias mixtas.(Con más de 2 jugadores, el seguidor es el último jugador en comprometerse, el líder es el primero). La investigación futura puede tomar varias direcciones. Primero, podemos evaluar empíricamente las técnicas presentadas aquí en suites de prueba como Gamut [19]. También podemos estudiar el cálculo de estrategias óptimas para comprometerse en otras representaciones concisas de los juegos de forma normal, por ejemplo, en juegos gráficos [10] o juegos de gráficos de efecto local/acción [14, 1]. Para los casos en que calcular una estrategia óptima para comprometerse es NP-Hard, también podemos estudiar el cálculo de estrategias aproximadamente óptimas para comprometerse. Si bien la definición correcta de una estrategia aproximadamente óptima es que en este entorno puede parecer simple al principio, debería ser una estrategia que, si los siguientes jugadores juegan de manera óptima, se desempeña casi tan bien como la estrategia óptima en la expectativa: esta definición se vuelve problemática cuando nosotrosConsidere que los otros jugadores también pueden estar jugando solo aproximadamente de manera óptima. También se puede estudiar modelos en los que múltiples (pero no todos) los jugadores se comprometen al mismo tiempo. Otra dirección interesante para seguir es ver si calcular estrategias mixtas óptimas para comprometerse puede ayudarnos o arrojar luz sobre, calcular los equilibrios de Nash. A menudo, las estrategias mixtas óptimas para comprometerse también son estrategias de equilibrio de Nash (por ejemplo, en los juegos de dos jugadores de suma cero esto siempre es cierto), aunque este no siempre es el caso (por ejemplo, como ya señalamos, a veces elLa estrategia óptima para comprometerse es una estrategia estrictamente dominada, que nunca puede ser una estrategia de equilibrio NASH).5.

        "Computing the Optimal Strategy to Commit to∗ Vincent Conitzer Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA conitzer@cs.cmu.edu Tuomas Sandholm Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA sandholm@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
        "However, this model is not always realistic.",
        "In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision.",
        "Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",
        "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position).",
        "In this paper, we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games.",
        "We give both positive results (efficient algorithms) and negative results (NP-hardness results).",

        "INTRODUCTION In multiagent systems with self-interested agents (including most economic settings), the optimal action for one agent to take depends on the actions that the other agents take.",
        "To analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied.",
        "Typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
        "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
        "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
        "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
        "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
        "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
        "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
        "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
        "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
        "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",
        "However, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner.",
        "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
        "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
        "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
        "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
        "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
        "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
        "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
        "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",
        "In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.",
        "Models of leadership are especially important in settings with multiple self-interested software agents.",
        "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
        "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
        "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",
        "Finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining players then play.",
        "Mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the EC community: the papers published on mechanism design in recent EC conferences are too numerous to cite.",
        "Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.",
        "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
        "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
        "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
        "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
        "However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.",
        "Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first.",
        "The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.",
        "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
        "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
        "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
        "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
        "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
        "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
        "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
        "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
        "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
        "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
        "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
        "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
        "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
        "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
        "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
        "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
        "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
        "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
        "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
        "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
        "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
        "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
        "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
        "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
        "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
        "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
        "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
        "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
        "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",
        "Theorem 1.",
        "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
        "Proof.",
        "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
        "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
        "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
        "We now present the algorithm formally.",
        "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
        "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
        "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
        "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",
        "In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)",
        "We note that arg max is set-valued.",
        "Then, the following algorithm computes all optimal strategy profiles: Algorithm Solve(G) if G has 0 players return {e} C ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ SG 1 { O ← Solve(Su(G, s1)) O ← arg maxo∈O uG 1 (s1, o) if C = ∅ or uG 1 (s1, O ) = uG 1 (C) C ← C∪Append(s1, O ) if uG 1 (s1, O ) > uG 1 (C) C ←Append(s1, O ) } return C Every outcome is (potentially) examined by every player, which leads to the given runtime bound.",
        "As an example of how the algorithm works, consider the following 3-player game, in which the first player chooses the left or right matrix, the second player chooses a row, and the third player chooses a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 First we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond to best responses for the third player (removing them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 Next, we remove the entries in which the third player does not break ties in favor of the second player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finally, we remove the entries in which the second and third players do not break ties in favor of the first player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the first player. 2,1,1 84 Hence, in optimal play, the first player chooses the left matrix, the second player chooses the middle row, and the third player chooses the left column. (We note that this outcome is Pareto-dominated by (Right, Middle, Left).)",
        "For general normal-form games, each players utility for each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#players · #outcomes).",
        "Therefore, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In the special case of two-player zero-sum games, computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy, which minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can obtain.",
        "Minimax strategies constitute the only natural solution concept for two-player zero-sum games: von Neumanns Minimax Theorem [24] states that in two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter (in terms of the players utilities) which player gets to commit to a mixed strategy first, and a profile of mixed strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both strategies are minimax strategies.",
        "It is well-known that a minimax strategy can be found in polynomial time, using linear programming [17].",
        "Our first result in this section generalizes this result, showing that an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to can be efficiently computed in general-sum two-player games, again using linear programming.",
        "Theorem 2.",
        "In 2-player normal-form games, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming.",
        "Proof.",
        "For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders utility.",
        "Such a mixed strategy can be computed using the following simple linear program: maximize s∈S psul(s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, s∈S psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈S psuf (s, t ) s∈S ps = 1 We note that this program may be infeasible for some follower strategies t, for example, if t is a strictly dominated strategy.",
        "Nevertheless, the program must be feasible for at least some follower strategies; among these follower strategies, choose a strategy t∗ that maximizes the linear programs solution value.",
        "Then, if the leader chooses as her mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps for the linear program for t∗ , and the follower plays t∗ , this constitutes an optimal strategy profile.",
        "In the following result, we show that we cannot expect to solve the problem more efficiently than linear programming, because we can reduce any linear program with a probability constraint on its variables to a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normalform game.",
        "Theorem 3.",
        "Any linear program whose variables xi (with xi ∈ R≥0 ) must satsify i xi = 1 can be modeled as a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normal-form game.",
        "Proof.",
        "Let the leader have a pure strategy i for every variable xi.",
        "Let the column player have one pure strategy j for every constraint in the linear program (other than i xi = 1), and a single additional pure strategy 0.",
        "Let the utility functions be as follows.",
        "Writing the objective of the linear program as maximize i cixi, for any i, let ul(i, 0) = ci and uf (i, 0) = 0.",
        "Writing the jth constraint of the linear program (not including i xi = 1) as i aijxi ≤ bj, for any i, j > 0, let ul(i, j) = mini ci − 1 and uf (i, j) = aij − bj.",
        "For example, consider the following linear program. maximize 2x1 + x2 subject to x1 + x2 = 1 5x1 + 2x2 ≤ 3 7x1 − 2x2 ≤ 2 The optimal solution to this program is x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3.",
        "Our reduction transforms this program into the following leader-follower game (where the leader is the row player). 2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 Indeed, the optimal strategy for the leader is to play the top strategy with probability 1/3 and the bottom strategy with probability 2/3.",
        "We now show that the reduction works in general.",
        "Clearly, the leader wants to incentivize the follower to play 0, because the utility that the leader gets when the follower plays 0 is always greater than when the follower does not play 0.",
        "In order for the follower not to prefer playing j > 0 rather than 0, it must be the case that i pl(i)(aij − bj) ≤ 0, or equivalently i pl(i)aij ≤ bj.",
        "Hence the leader will get a utility of at least mini ci if and only if there is a feasible solution to the constraints.",
        "Given that the pl(i) incentivize the follower to play 0, the leader attempts to maximize i pl(i)ci.",
        "Thus the leader must solve the original linear program.",
        "As an alternative proof of Theorem 3, one may observe that it is known that finding a minimax strategy in a zerosum game is as hard as the linear programming problem [6], and as we pointed out at the beginning of this section, computing a minimax strategy in a zero-sum game is a special case of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to.",
        "This polynomial-time solvability of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in two-player normal-form games contrasts with the unknown complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium in such games [21], as well as with the NP-hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium with maximum utility for a given player in such games [8, 2].",
        "Unfortunately, this result does not generalize to more than two players-here, the problem becomes NP-hard.",
        "To show this, we reduce from the VERTEX-COVER problem.",
        "Definition 1.",
        "In VERTEX-COVER, we are given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. We are asked whether there 85 exists a subset of the vertices S ⊆ V , with |S| = K, such that every edge e ∈ E has at least one of its endpoints in S. BALANCED-VERTEX-COVER is the special case of VERTEX-COVER in which K = |V |/2.",
        "VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete [9].",
        "The following lemma shows that the hardness remains if we require K = |V |/2. (Similar results have been shown for other NP-complete problems.)",
        "Lemma 1.",
        "BALANCED-VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete.",
        "Proof.",
        "Membership in NP follows from the fact that the problem is a special case of VERTEX-COVER, which is in NP.",
        "To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary VERTEX-COVER instance to a BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER instance, as follows.",
        "If, for the VERTEX-COVER instance, K > |V |/2, then we simply add isolated vertices that are disjoint from the rest of the graph, until K = |V |/2.",
        "If K < |V |/2, we add isolated triangles (that is, the complete graph on three vertices) to the graph, increasing K by 2 every time, until K = |V |/2.",
        "Theorem 4.",
        "In 3-player normal-form games, finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to is NP-hard.",
        "Proof.",
        "We reduce an arbitrary BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER instance to the following 3-player normal-form game.",
        "For every vertex v, each of the three players has a pure strategy corresponding to that vertex (rv, sv, tv, respectively).",
        "In addition, for every edge e, the third player has a pure strategy te; and finally, the third player has one additional pure strategy t0.",
        "The utilities are as follows: • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, u1(r, s, t0) = u2(r, s, t0) = 1; • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, t ∈ T−{t0}, u1(r, s, t) = u2(r, s, t) = 0; • for all v ∈ V, s ∈ S, u3(rv, s, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ V, r ∈ R, u3(r, sv, tv) = 0; • for all v ∈ V , for all r ∈ R − {rv}, s ∈ S − {sv}, u3(r, s, tv) = |V | |V |−2 ; • for all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, for both v ∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = 0; • for all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, for all v /∈ e, u3(rv, s, te) = |V | |V |−2 . • for all r ∈ R, s ∈ S, u3(r, s, t0) = 1.",
        "We note that players 1 and 2 have the same utility function.",
        "We claim that there is an optimal strategy profile in which players 1 and 2 both obtain 1 (their maximum utility) if and only if there is a solution to the BALANCED-VERTEXCOVER problem. (Otherwise, these players will both obtain 0.)",
        "First, suppose there exists a solution to the BALANCEDVERTEX-COVER problem.",
        "Then, let player 1 play every rv such that v is in the cover with probability 2 |V | , and let player 2 play every sv such that v is not in the cover with probability 2 |V | .",
        "Then, for player 3, the expected utility of playing tv (for any v) is (1 − 2 |V | ) |V | |V |−2 = 1, because there is a chance of 2 |V | that rv or sv is played.",
        "Additionally, the expected utility of playing te (for any e) is at most (1 − 2 |V | ) |V | |V |−2 = 1, because there is a chance of at least 2 |V | that some rv with v ∈ e is played (because player 1 is randomizing over the pure strategies corresponding to the cover).",
        "It follows that playing t0 is a best response for player 3, giving players 1 and 2 a utility of 1.",
        "Now, suppose that players 1 and 2 obtain 1 in optimal play.",
        "Then, it must be the case that player 3 plays t0.",
        "Hence, for every v ∈ V , there must be a probability of at least 2 |V | that either rv or sv is played, for otherwise player 3 would be better off playing tv.",
        "Because players 1 and 2 have only a total probability of 2 to distribute, it must be the case that for each v, either rv or sv is played with probability 2 |V | , and the other is played with probability 0. (It is not possible for both to have nonzero probability, because then there would be some probability that both are played simultaneously (correlation is not possible), hence the total probability of at least one being played could not be high enough for all vertices.)",
        "Thus, for exactly half the v ∈ V , player 1 places probability 2 |V | on rv.",
        "Moreover, for every e ∈ E, there must be a probability of at least 2 |V | that some rv with v ∈ e is played, for otherwise player 3 would be better off playing te.",
        "Thus, the v ∈ V such that player 1 places probability 2 |V | on rv constitute a balanced vertex cover. 3.",
        "BAYESIAN GAMES So far, we have restricted our attention to normal-form games.",
        "In a normal-form game, it is assumed that every agent knows every other agents preferences over the outcomes of the game.",
        "In general, however, agents may have some private information about their preferences that is not known to the other agents.",
        "Moreover, at the time of commitment to a strategy, the agents may not even know their own (final) preferences over the outcomes of the game yet, because these preferences may be dependent on a context that has yet to materialize.",
        "For example, when the code for a trading agent is written, it may not yet be clear how that agent will value resources that it will negotiate over later, because this depends on information that is not yet available at the time at which the code is written (such as orders that will have been placed to the agent before the negotiation).",
        "In this section, we will study commitment in Bayesian games, which can model such uncertainty over preferences. 3.1 Definitions In a Bayesian game, every player i has a set of actions Si, a set of types Θi with an associated probability distribution πi : Θi → [0, 1], and, for each type θi, a utility function uθi i : S1 × S2 × . . . × Sn → R. A pure strategy in a Bayesian game is a mapping from the players types to actions, σi : Θi → Si. (Bayesian games can be rewritten in normal form by enumerating every pure strategy σi, but this will cause an exponential blowup in the size of the representation of the game and therefore cannot lead to efficient algorithms.)",
        "The strategy that the leader should commit to depends on whether, at the time of commitment, the leader knows her own type.",
        "If the leader does know her own type, the other types that the leader might have had become irrelevant and the leader should simply commit to the strategy that is optimal for the type.",
        "However, as argued above, the leader does not necessarily know her own type at the time of commitment (e.g., the time at which the code is submitted).",
        "In this case, the leader must commit to a strategy that is 86 dependent upon the leaders eventual type.",
        "We will study this latter model, although we will pay specific attention to the case where the leader has only a single type, which is effectively the same as the former model. 3.2 Commitment to pure strategies It turns out that computing an optimal pure strategy to commit to is hard in Bayesian games, even with two players.",
        "Theorem 5.",
        "Finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to in 2-player Bayesian games is NP-hard, even when the follower has only a single type.",
        "Proof.",
        "We reduce an arbitrary VERTEX-COVER instance to the following Bayesian game between the leader and the follower.",
        "The leader has K types θ1, θ2, . . . , θK , each occurring with probability 1/K, and for every vertex v ∈ V , the leader has an action sv.",
        "The follower has only a single type; for each edge e ∈ E, the follower has an action te, and the follower has a single additional action t0.",
        "The utility function for the leader is given by, for all θl ∈ Θl and all s ∈ S, u θl l (s, t0) = 1, and for all e ∈ E, u θl l (s, te) = 0.",
        "The followers utility is given by: • For all v ∈ V , for all e ∈ E with v /∈ e, uf (sv, te) = 1; • For all v ∈ V , for all e ∈ E with v ∈ e, uf (sv, te) = −K; • For all v ∈ V , uf (sv, t0) = 0.",
        "We claim that the leader can get a utility of 1 if and only if there is a solution to the VERTEX-COVER instance.",
        "First, suppose that there is a solution to the VERTEXCOVER instance.",
        "Then, the leader can commit to a pure strategy such that for each vertex v in the cover, the leader plays sv for some type.",
        "Then, the followers utility for playing te (for any e ∈ E) is at most K−1 K + 1 K (−K) = − 1 K , so that the follower will prefer to play t0, which gives the leader a utility of 1, as required.",
        "Now, suppose that there is a pure strategy for the leader that will give the leader a utility of 1.",
        "Then, the follower must play t0.",
        "In order for the follower not to prefer playing te (for any e ∈ E) instead, for at least one v ∈ e the leader must play sv for some type θl.",
        "Hence, the set of vertices v that the leader plays for some type must constitute a vertex cover; and this set can have size at most K, because the leader has only K types.",
        "So there is a solution to the VERTEXCOVER instance.",
        "However, if the leader has only a single type, then the problem becomes easy again (#types is the number of types for the follower): Theorem 6.",
        "In 2-player Bayesian games in which the leader has only a single type, an optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found in O(#outcomes · #types) time.",
        "Proof.",
        "For every leader action s, we can compute, for every follower type θf ∈ Θf , which actions t maximize the followers utility; call this set of actions BRθf (s).",
        "Then, the utility that the leader receives for committing to action s can be computed as θf ∈Θf π(θf ) maxt∈BRθf (s) ul(s, t), and the leader can choose the best action to commit to. 3.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In two-player zero-sum imperfect information games with perfect recall (no player ever forgets something that it once knew), a minimax strategy can be constructed in polynomial time [12, 13].",
        "Unfortunately, this result does not extend to computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to in the general-sum case-not even in Bayesian games.",
        "We will exhibit NP-hardness by reducing from the INDEPENDENTSET problem.",
        "Definition 2.",
        "In INDEPENDENT-SET, we are given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. We are asked whether there exists a subset of the vertices S ⊆ V , with |S| = K, such that no edge e ∈ E has both of its endpoints in S. Again, this problem is NP-complete [9].",
        "Theorem 7.",
        "Finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in 2-player Bayesian games is NP-hard, even when the leader has only a single type and the follower has only two actions.",
        "Proof.",
        "We reduce an arbitrary INDEPENDENT-SET instance to the following Bayesian game between the leader and the follower.",
        "The leader has only a single type, and for every vertex v ∈ V , the leader has an action sv.",
        "The follower has a type θv for every v ∈ V , occurring with probability 1 (|E|+1)|V | , and a type θe for every e ∈ E, occurring with probability 1 |E|+1 .",
        "The follower has two actions: t0 and t1.",
        "The leaders utility is given by, for all s ∈ S, ul(s, t0) = 1 and ul(s, t1) = 0.",
        "The followers utility is given by: • For all v ∈ V , uθv f (sv, t1) = 0; • For all v ∈ V and s ∈ S − {sv}, uθv f (s, t1) = K K−1 ; • For all v ∈ V and s ∈ S, uθv f (s, t0) = 1; • For all e ∈ E, s ∈ S, uθe f (s, t0) = 1; • For all e ∈ E, for both v ∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 2K 3 ; • For all e ∈ E, for all v /∈ e, uθe f (sv, t1) = 0.",
        "We claim that an optimal strategy to commit to gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | if and only if there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance.",
        "First, suppose that there is a solution to the INDEPENDENT-SET instance.",
        "Then, the leader could commit to the following strategy: for every vertex v in the independent set, play the corresponding sv with probability 1/K.",
        "If the follower has type θe for some e ∈ E, the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 is at most 1 K 2K 3 = 2/3, because there is at most one vertex v ∈ e such that sv is played with nonzero probability.",
        "Hence, the follower will play t0 and obtain a utility of 1.",
        "If the follower has type θv for some vertex v in the independent set, the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 is K−1 K K K−1 = 1, because the leader plays sv with probability 1/K.",
        "It follows that the follower (who breaks ties to maximize the leaders utility) will play t0, which also gives a utility of 1 and gives the leader a higher utility.",
        "Hence the leaders expected utility for this strategy is at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | , as required. 87 Now, suppose that there is a strategy that gives the leader an expected utility of at least |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | .",
        "Then, this strategy must induce the follower to play t0 whenever it has a type of the form θe (because otherwise, the utility could be at most |E|−1 |E|+1 + |V | (|E|+1)|V | = |E| |E|+1 < |E| |E|+1 + K (|E|+1)|V | ).",
        "Thus, it cannot be the case that for some edge e = (v1, v2) ∈ E, the probability that the leader plays one of sv1 and sv2 is at least 2/K, because then the expected utility for the follower of playing t1 when it has type θe would be at least 2 K 2K 3 = 4/3 > 1.",
        "Moreover, the strategy must induce the follower to play t0 for at least K types of the form θv.",
        "Inducing the follower to play t0 when it has type θv can be done only by playing sv with probability at least 1/K, which will give the follower a utility of at most K−1 K K K−1 = 1 for playing t1.",
        "But then, the set of vertices v such that sv is played with probability at least 1/K must constitute an independent set of size K (because if there were an edge e between two such vertices, it would induce the follower to play t1 for type θe by the above).",
        "By contrast, if the follower has only a single type, then we can generalize the linear programming approach for normalform games: Theorem 8.",
        "In 2-player Bayesian games in which the follower has only a single type, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming.",
        "Proof.",
        "We generalize the approach in Theorem 2 as follows.",
        "For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader for every one of the leaders types such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders ex ante expected utility.",
        "To do so, we generalize the linear program as follows: maximize θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S pθl s uθl l (s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t) ≥ θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t ) for all θl ∈ Θl, s∈S p θl s = 1 As in Theorem 2, the solution for the linear program that maximizes the solution value is an optimal strategy to commit to.",
        "This shows an interesting contrast between commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in Bayesian games: for pure strategies, the problem becomes easy if the leader has only a single type (but not if the follower has only a single type), whereas for mixed strategies, the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single type (but not if the leader has only a single type). 4.",
        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
        "This requires some equilibrium notion (Nash equilibrium and its refinements), and often leads to the equilibrium selection problem: it is unclear to each individual player according to which equilibrium she should play.",
        "However, this model is not always realistic.",
        "In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision.",
        "For example, one agent may arrive at the (real or virtual) site of the game before the other, or, in the specific case of software agents, the code for one agent may be completed and committed before that of another agent.",
        "Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",
        "Specifically, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (optimal) commitment never hurts the leader, and often helps.",
        "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position).",
        "In this paper, we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games.",
        "For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any number of players.",
        "An optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two players using linear programming (and no more efficiently than that, in the sense that any linear program with a probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of minimax strategies in normal-form games.)",
        "The problem becomes NP-hard for three (or more) players.",
        "In Bayesian games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the follower has only a single type, although two-player games in which the leader has only a single type can be solved efficiently.",
        "The problem of finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a Bayesian game is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the leader has only a single type, although two-player games in which the follower has only a single type can be solved efficiently using a generalization of the linear progamming approach for normal-form games.",
        "The following two tables summarize these results. 2 players ≥ 3 players normal-form O(#outcomes) O(#outcomes· #players) Bayesian, O(#outcomes· NP-hard 1-type leader #types) Bayesian, NP-hard NP-hard 1-type follower Bayesian (general) NP-hard NP-hard Results for commitment to pure strategies.

(With more than 2 players, the follower is the last player to commit, the leader is the first.)",
        "Future research can take a number of directions.",
        "First, we can empirically evaluate the techniques presented here on test suites such as GAMUT [19].",
        "We can also study the computation of optimal strategies to commit to in other1 concise representations of normal-form games-for example, in graphical games [10] or local-effect/action graph games [14, 1].",
        "For the cases where computing an optimal strategy to commit to is NP-hard, we can also study the computation of approximately optimal strategies to commit to.",
        "While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing only approximately optimally.",
        "One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time.",
        "Another interesting direction to pursue is to see if computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us in, or otherwise shed light on, computing Nash equilibria.",
        "Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum games this is always true), although this is not always the case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy). 5.",

                "To analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied.",
                "Typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
                "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
                "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
                "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
                "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
                "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
                "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
                "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",
                "However, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner.",
                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
                "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",
                "In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.",
                "Models of leadership are especially important in settings with multiple self-interested software agents.",
                "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
                "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
                "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",
                "Finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining players then play.",
                "Mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the EC community: the papers published on mechanism design in recent EC conferences are too numerous to cite.",
                "Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.",
                "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
                "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
                "However, the computation of the <br>optimal strategy</br> to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.",
                "Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first.",
                "The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.",
                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the <br>optimal strategy</br> to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the <br>optimal strategy</br> to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an <br>optimal strategy</br> for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an <br>optimal strategy</br> to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
                "Thus, we define an <br>optimal strategy</br> to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all <br>optimal strategy</br> profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its <br>optimal strategy</br> profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the <br>optimal strategy</br> profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",
                "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
                "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
                "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
                "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",
                "In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)",
                "We note that arg max is set-valued.",
                "Then, the following algorithm computes all <br>optimal strategy</br> profiles: Algorithm Solve(G) if G has 0 players return {e} C ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ SG 1 { O ← Solve(Su(G, s1)) O ← arg maxo∈O uG 1 (s1, o) if C = ∅ or uG 1 (s1, O ) = uG 1 (C) C ← C∪Append(s1, O ) if uG 1 (s1, O ) > uG 1 (C) C ←Append(s1, O ) } return C Every outcome is (potentially) examined by every player, which leads to the given runtime bound.",
                "As an example of how the algorithm works, consider the following 3-player game, in which the first player chooses the left or right matrix, the second player chooses a row, and the third player chooses a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 First we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond to best responses for the third player (removing them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 Next, we remove the entries in which the third player does not break ties in favor of the second player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finally, we remove the entries in which the second and third players do not break ties in favor of the first player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the first player. 2,1,1 84 Hence, in optimal play, the first player chooses the left matrix, the second player chooses the middle row, and the third player chooses the left column. (We note that this outcome is Pareto-dominated by (Right, Middle, Left).)",
                "For general normal-form games, each players utility for each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#players · #outcomes).",
                "Therefore, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In the special case of two-player zero-sum games, computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy, which minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can obtain.",
                "Minimax strategies constitute the only natural solution concept for two-player zero-sum games: von Neumanns Minimax Theorem [24] states that in two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter (in terms of the players utilities) which player gets to commit to a mixed strategy first, and a profile of mixed strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both strategies are minimax strategies.",
                "It is well-known that a minimax strategy can be found in polynomial time, using linear programming [17].",
                "Our first result in this section generalizes this result, showing that an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to can be efficiently computed in general-sum two-player games, again using linear programming.",
                "Theorem 2.",
                "In 2-player normal-form games, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming.",
                "Proof.",
                "For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders utility.",
                "Such a mixed strategy can be computed using the following simple linear program: maximize s∈S psul(s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, s∈S psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈S psuf (s, t ) s∈S ps = 1 We note that this program may be infeasible for some follower strategies t, for example, if t is a strictly dominated strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, the program must be feasible for at least some follower strategies; among these follower strategies, choose a strategy t∗ that maximizes the linear programs solution value.",
                "Then, if the leader chooses as her mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps for the linear program for t∗ , and the follower plays t∗ , this constitutes an <br>optimal strategy</br> profile.",
                "In the following result, we show that we cannot expect to solve the problem more efficiently than linear programming, because we can reduce any linear program with a probability constraint on its variables to a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normalform game.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "Any linear program whose variables xi (with xi ∈ R≥0 ) must satsify i xi = 1 can be modeled as a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normal-form game.",
                "Proof.",
                "Let the leader have a pure strategy i for every variable xi.",
                "Let the column player have one pure strategy j for every constraint in the linear program (other than i xi = 1), and a single additional pure strategy 0.",

                "Our reduction transforms this program into the following leader-follower game (where the leader is the row player). 2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 Indeed, the <br>optimal strategy</br> for the leader is to play the top strategy with probability 1/3 and the bottom strategy with probability 2/3.",
                "We now show that the reduction works in general.",
                "Clearly, the leader wants to incentivize the follower to play 0, because the utility that the leader gets when the follower plays 0 is always greater than when the follower does not play 0.",
                "In order for the follower not to prefer playing j > 0 rather than 0, it must be the case that i pl(i)(aij − bj) ≤ 0, or equivalently i pl(i)aij ≤ bj.",

                "As an alternative proof of Theorem 3, one may observe that it is known that finding a minimax strategy in a zerosum game is as hard as the linear programming problem [6], and as we pointed out at the beginning of this section, computing a minimax strategy in a zero-sum game is a special case of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to.",
                "This polynomial-time solvability of the problem of computing an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in two-player normal-form games contrasts with the unknown complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium in such games [21], as well as with the NP-hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium with maximum utility for a given player in such games [8, 2].",

A pure strategy in a Bayesian game is a mapping from the players types to actions, σi : Θi → Si.

                "However, this model is not always realistic.",
                "In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision.",
                "Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",
                "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position).",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games.",
                "We give both positive results (efficient algorithms) and negative results (NP-hardness results).",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics; I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Multiagent Systems; F.2 [Theory of Computation]: Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity General Terms Algorithms, Economics, Theory 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In <br>multiagent system</br>s with self-interested agents (including most economic settings), the optimal action for one agent to take depends on the actions that the other agents take.",
                "To analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied.",
                "Typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
                "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
                "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
                "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
                "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
                "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
                "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
                "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",
                "However, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner.",
                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
                "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",
                "In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.",
                "Models of leadership are especially important in settings with multiple self-interested software agents.",
                "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
                "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
                "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",
                "Finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining players then play.",
                "Mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the EC community: the papers published on mechanism design in recent EC conferences are too numerous to cite.",
                "Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.",
                "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
                "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
                "However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.",
                "Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first.",
                "The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.",
                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
                "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",
                "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
                "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
                "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
                "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",

                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",

                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",

                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",

                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",

                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.

Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",

                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",

                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",

Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",

                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",

                "This shows an interesting contrast between commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in Bayesian games: for pure strategies, the problem becomes easy if the leader has only a single type (but not if the follower has only a single type), whereas for mixed strategies, the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single type (but not if the leader has only a single type). 4.",

Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",

                "INTRODUCTION In multiagent systems with self-interested agents (including most economic settings), the optimal action for one agent to take depends on the actions that the other agents take.",
                "To analyze how an agent should behave in such settings, the tools of game theory need to be applied.",
                "Typically, when a strategic setting is modeled in the framework of game theory, it is assumed that players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
                "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
                "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
                "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
                "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
                "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
                "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
                "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a <br>mixed strategy</br> for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",

                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
                "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",
                "In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.",

                "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
                "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
                "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",
                "Finally, there is also an implicit leadership situation in the field of mechanism design, in which one player (the designer) gets to choose the rules of the game that the remaining players then play.",
                "Mechanism design is an extremely important topic to the EC community: the papers published on mechanism design in recent EC conferences are too numerous to cite.",
                "Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.",
                "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
                "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
                "However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.",
                "Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first.",
                "The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.",
                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a <br>mixed strategy</br> in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A <br>mixed strategy</br> for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a <br>mixed strategy</br>, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal <br>mixed strategy</br> to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal <br>mixed strategy</br> for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
                "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",
                "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
                "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
                "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
                "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",
                "In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)",

                "In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision.",
                "For example, one agent may arrive at the (real or virtual) site of the game before the other, or, in the specific case of software agents, the code for one agent may be completed and committed before that of another agent.",
                "Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",

                "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position).",

                "For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any number of players.",
                "An optimal <br>mixed strategy</br> to commit to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two players using linear programming (and no more efficiently than that, in the sense that any linear program with a probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of minimax strategies in normal-form games.)",
                "The problem becomes NP-hard for three (or more) players.",
                "In Bayesian games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the follower has only a single type, although two-player games in which the leader has only a single type can be solved efficiently.",

                "While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing only approximately optimally.",
                "One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time.",
                "Another interesting direction to pursue is to see if computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us in, or otherwise shed light on, computing Nash equilibria.",
                "Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum games this is always true), although this is not always the case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy). 5.",

                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",
                "However, in many real-world settings, strategies are not selected in such a simultaneous manner.",
                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",

                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",

                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.

Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",

A pure strategy in a Bayesian game is a mapping from the players types to actions, σi : Θi → Si. (Bayesian games can be rewritten in normal form by enumerating every pure strategy σi, but this will cause an exponential blowup in the size of the representation of the game and therefore cannot lead to efficient algorithms.)",

                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",

                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",

                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",

                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
                "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",

                "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",
                "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
                "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
                "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
                "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",
                "In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)",
                "We note that arg max is set-valued.",
                "Then, the following algorithm computes all optimal strategy profiles: Algorithm Solve(G) if G has 0 players return {e} C ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ SG 1 { O ← Solve(Su(G, s1)) O ← arg maxo∈O uG 1 (s1, o) if C = ∅ or uG 1 (s1, O ) = uG 1 (C) C ← C∪Append(s1, O ) if uG 1 (s1, O ) > uG 1 (C) C ←Append(s1, O ) } return C Every outcome is (potentially) examined by every player, which leads to the given runtime bound.",
                "As an example of how the algorithm works, consider the following 3-player game, in which the first player chooses the left or right matrix, the second player chooses a row, and the third player chooses a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 First we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond to best responses for the third player (removing them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 Next, we remove the entries in which the third player does not break ties in favor of the second player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finally, we remove the entries in which the second and third players do not break ties in favor of the first player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the first player. 2,1,1 84 Hence, in optimal play, the first player chooses the left matrix, the second player chooses the middle row, and the third player chooses the left column. (We note that this outcome is Pareto-dominated by (Right, Middle, Left).)",
                "For general normal-form games, each players utility for each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#players · #outcomes).",
                "Therefore, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In the special case of two-player zero-sum games, computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy, which minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can obtain.",
                "Minimax strategies constitute the only natural solution concept for two-player zero-sum games: von Neumanns Minimax Theorem [24] states that in two-player zero-sum games, it does not matter (in terms of the players utilities) which player gets to commit to a mixed strategy first, and a profile of mixed strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if both strategies are minimax strategies.",
                "It is well-known that a minimax strategy can be found in polynomial time, using linear programming [17].",
                "Our first result in this section generalizes this result, showing that an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to can be efficiently computed in general-sum two-player games, again using linear programming.",

                "In 2-player normal-form games, an optimal mixed strategy to commit to can be found in polynomial time using linear programming.",
                "Proof.",
                "For every pure follower strategy t, we compute a mixed strategy for the leader such that 1) playing t is a best response for the follower, and 2) under this constraint, the mixed strategy maximizes the leaders utility.",
                "Such a mixed strategy can be computed using the following simple linear program: maximize s∈S psul(s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, s∈S psuf (s, t) ≥ s∈S psuf (s, t ) s∈S ps = 1 We note that this program may be infeasible for some follower strategies t, for example, if t is a strictly dominated strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, the program must be feasible for at least some follower strategies; among these follower strategies, choose a strategy t∗ that maximizes the linear programs solution value.",
                "Then, if the leader chooses as her mixed strategy the optimal settings of the variables ps for the linear program for t∗ , and the follower plays t∗ , this constitutes an optimal strategy profile.",
                "In the following result, we show that we cannot expect to solve the problem more efficiently than linear programming, because we can reduce any linear program with a probability constraint on its variables to a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normalform game.",
                "Theorem 3.",
                "Any linear program whose variables xi (with xi ∈ R≥0 ) must satsify i xi = 1 can be modeled as a problem of computing the optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a 2-player normal-form game.",
                "Proof.",
                "Let the leader have a pure strategy i for every variable xi.",
                "Let the column player have one pure strategy j for every constraint in the linear program (other than i xi = 1), and a single additional pure strategy 0.",

                "Our reduction transforms this program into the following leader-follower game (where the leader is the row player). 2, 0 0, 2 0, 5 1, 0 0, -1 0, -4 Indeed, the optimal strategy for the leader is to play the top strategy with probability 1/3 and the bottom strategy with probability 2/3.",
                "We now show that the reduction works in general.",
                "Clearly, the leader wants to incentivize the follower to play 0, because the utility that the leader gets when the follower plays 0 is always greater than when the follower does not play 0.",
                "In order for the follower not to prefer playing j > 0 rather than 0, it must be the case that i pl(i)(aij − bj) ≤ 0, or equivalently i pl(i)aij ≤ bj.",
                "Hence the leader will get a utility of at least mini ci if and only if there is a feasible solution to the constraints.",
                "Given that the pl(i) incentivize the follower to play 0, the leader attempts to maximize i pl(i)ci.",

                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) <br>nash equilibrium</br> [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",

                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal leadership strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) leadership game.",
                "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",
                "Theorem 1.",
                "Under commitment to pure strategies, the set of all optimal strategy profiles in a normal-form game can be found in O(#players · #outcomes) time.",
                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",
                "Let Su(G, s1) be the subgame that results after the first (remaining) player in G plays s1 ∈ SG 1 .",
                "A game with 0 players is simply an outcome of the game.",
                "The function Append(s, O) appends the strategy s to each of the vectors of strategies in the set O.",
                "Let e be the empty vector with no elements.",
                "In a slight abuse of notation, we will write uG 1 (C) when all strategy profiles in the set C give player 1 the same utility in the game G. (Here, player 1 is the first remaining player in the subgame G, not necessarily player 1 in the original game.)",
                "We note that arg max is set-valued.",
                "Then, the following algorithm computes all optimal strategy profiles: Algorithm Solve(G) if G has 0 players return {e} C ← ∅ for all s1 ∈ SG 1 { O ← Solve(Su(G, s1)) O ← arg maxo∈O uG 1 (s1, o) if C = ∅ or uG 1 (s1, O ) = uG 1 (C) C ← C∪Append(s1, O ) if uG 1 (s1, O ) > uG 1 (C) C ←Append(s1, O ) } return C Every outcome is (potentially) examined by every player, which leads to the given runtime bound.",
                "As an example of how the algorithm works, consider the following 3-player game, in which the first player chooses the left or right matrix, the second player chooses a row, and the third player chooses a column. 0,1,1 1,1,0 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 0,0,0 3,3,0 3,3,0 0,2,0 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,0,0 0,5,1 0,0,0 3,0,0 First we eliminate the outcomes that do not correspond to best responses for the third player (removing them from the matrix): 0,1,1 1,0,1 2,1,1 3,0,1 1,1,1 0,0,1 3,0,1 4,4,2 0,0,2 0,5,1 Next, we remove the entries in which the third player does not break ties in favor of the second player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the second player. 0,1,1 2,1,1 1,1,1 0,5,1 Finally, we remove the entries in which the second and third players do not break ties in favor of the first player, as well as entries that do not correspond to best responses for the first player. 2,1,1 84 Hence, in optimal play, the first player chooses the left matrix, the second player chooses the middle row, and the third player chooses the left column. (We note that this outcome is Pareto-dominated by (Right, Middle, Left).)",
                "For general normal-form games, each players utility for each of the outcomes has to be explicitly represented in the input, so that the input size is itself Ω(#players · #outcomes).",
                "Therefore, the algorithm is in fact a linear-time algorithm. 2.3 Commitment to mixed strategies In the special case of two-player zero-sum games, computing an optimal mixed strategy for the leader to commit to is equivalent to computing a minimax strategy, which minimizes the maximum expected utility that the opponent can obtain.",

                "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
                "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
                "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
                "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
                "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
                "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
                "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",

                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
                "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",

                "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
                "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
                "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",

                "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
                "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
                "However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a leadership situation has gone ignored.",
                "Theoretically, leadership situations can simply be thought of as an extensive-form game in which one player chooses a strategy (for the original game) first.",
                "The number of strategies in this extensive-form game, however, can be exceedingly large.",
                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the leadership situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",

                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal leadership strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",

                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",

                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",

                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",

                "Quizás el ejemplo más temprano y más conocido del efecto del \"compromiso\" es que por von Stackelberg [25], quien demostró que, en el modelo de duopolio de Cournots [5], si una empresa puede comprometerse primero con una cantidad de producción, que primero, que primero, que primero, queLa empresa funcionará mucho mejor que en la solución simultánea de movimiento (NASH).",
                "En general, si el \"compromiso\" con las estrategias mixtas es posible, entonces (bajo supuestos menores) nunca hace daño, y a menudo ayuda, a comprometerse con una estrategia [26].",
                "En este documento, asumiremos que el \"compromiso\" siempre se ve forzado;Si no es así, el jugador que tiene la opción de comprometerse puede simplemente comparar el resultado de \"compromiso\" con el resultado de no comprometerse (simultáneo-movimiento).",
                "Por lo tanto, siempre que uno pueda mostrar de manera creíble que no se puede cambiar el código más adelante, el código sirve como un dispositivo de \"compromiso\".",
                "Por ejemplo, si el líder puede comprometerse con una estrategia mixta en el juego original, entonces cada una de las (continuas) estrategias mixtas constituye una estrategia pura en la representación extensa de la situación de liderazgo.(Observamos que un \"compromiso\" con una distribución no es lo mismo que una distribución sobre los compromisos).",
                "Podemos tener S = s para el caso de \"compromiso\" con estrategias puras, o s = ∆ (s), el conjunto de distribuciones de probabilidad sobre S, para el caso de \"compromiso\" con estrategias mixtas.(Observamos que reemplazar t por ∆ (t) no hace ninguna diferencia en esta definición.)",

                "Además, en el momento del \"compromiso\" con una estrategia, los agentes ni siquiera conocen sus propias preferencias (finales) sobre los resultados del juego todavía, porque estas preferencias pueden depender de un contexto que aún no se ha materializado.",

                "Sin embargo, como se argumentó anteriormente, el líder no necesariamente conoce su propio tipo en el momento del \"compromiso\" (por ejemplo, el momento en que se presenta el código).",
                "Estudiaremos este último modelo, aunque prestaremos atención específica al caso donde el líder solo tiene un tipo único, que es efectivamente lo mismo que el antiguo modelo.3.2 \"Compromiso\" con estrategias puras resulta que calcular una estrategia pura óptima para comprometerse es difícil en los juegos bayesianos, incluso con dos jugadores.",

                "Esto muestra un contraste interesante entre el \"compromiso\" con las estrategias puras y el \"compromiso\" con las estrategias mixtas en los juegos bayesianos: para las estrategias puras, el problema se vuelve fácil si el líder tiene solo un tipo (pero no si el seguidor tiene solo un tipo), mientras que para las estrategias mixtas, el problema se vuelve fácil si el seguidor tiene solo un tipo (pero no si el líder tiene solo un tipo).4.",

                "This is especially true when the setting is modeled as a normal-form game, which only specifies each agents utility as a function of the vector of strategies that the agents choose, and does not provide any information on the order in which agents make their decisions and what the agents observe about earlier decisions by other agents.",
                "Given that the game is modeled in normal form, it is typically analyzed using the concept of Nash equilibrium.",
                "A Nash equilibrium specifies a strategy for each player, such that no player has an incentive to individually deviate from this profile of strategies. (Typically, the strategies are allowed to be mixed, that is, probability distributions over the original (pure) strategies.)",
                "A (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in finite games [18], but one problem is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria.",
                "This leads to the equilibrium selection problem of how an agent can know which strategy to play if it does not know which equilibrium is to be played.",
                "When the setting is modeled as an extensive-form game, it is possible to specify that some players receive some information about actions taken by others earlier in the game before deciding on their action.",
                "Nevertheless, in general, the players do not know everything that happened earlier in the game.",
                "Because of this, these games are typically still analyzed using an equilibrium concept, where one specifies a mixed strategy for each player, and requires that each players strategy is a best response to the others strategies. (Typically an additional constraint on the strategies is now imposed to ensure that players do not play in a way that is irrational with respect to the information that they have received so far.",
                "This leads to refinements of Nash equilibrium such as subgame perfect and sequential equilibrium.)",

                "Oftentimes, one player (the leader) is able to commit to a strategy before another player (the follower).",
                "This can be due to a variety of reasons.",
                "For example, one of the players may arrive at the site at which the game is to be played before another agent (e.g., in economic settings, one player may enter a market earlier and commit to a way of doing busi82 ness).",
                "Such commitment power has a profound impact on how the game should be played.",
                "For example, the leader may be best off playing a strategy that is dominated in the normal-form representation of the game.",
                "Perhaps the earliest and best-known example of the effect of commitment is that by von Stackelberg [25], who showed that, in Cournots duopoly model [5], if one firm is able to commit to a production quantity first, that firm will do much better than in the simultaneous-move (Nash) solution.",
                "In general, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (under minor assumptions) it never hurts, and often helps, to commit to a strategy [26].",
                "Being forced to commit to a pure strategy sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts (for example, committing to a pure strategy in rock-paper-scissors before the other players decision will naturally result in a loss).",
                "In this paper, we will assume commitment is always forced; if it is not, the player who has the choice of whether to commit can simply compare the commitment outcome to the non-commitment (simultaneous-move) outcome.",

                "Once the code for an agent (or for a team of agents) is finalized and the agent is deployed, the agent is committed to playing the (possibly randomized) strategy that the code prescribes.",
                "Thus, as long as one can credibly show that one cannot change the code later, the code serves as a commitment device.",
                "This holds true for recreational tournaments among agents (e.g., poker tournaments, RoboSoccer), and for industrial applications such as sensor webs.",

                "Indeed, the mechanism designer may benefit from committing to a choice that, if the (remaining) agents actions were fixed, would be suboptimal.",
                "For example, in a (first-price) auction, the seller may wish to set a positive (artificial) reserve price for the item, below which the item will not be sold-even if the seller values the item at 0.",
                "In hindsight (after the bids have come in), this (na¨ıvely) appears suboptimal: if a bid exceeding the reserve price came in, the reserve price had no effect, and if no such bid came in, the seller would have been better off accepting a lower bid.",
                "Of course, the reason for setting the reserve price is that it incentivizes the bidders to bid higher, and because of this, setting artificial reserve prices can actually increase expected revenue to the seller.",
                "A significant amount of research has recently been devoted to the computation of solutions according to various solution concepts for settings in which the agents choose their strategies simultaneously, such as dominance [7, 11, 3] and (especially) Nash equilibrium [8, 21, 16, 15, 2, 22, 23, 4].",
                "However, the computation of the optimal strategy to commit to in a <br>leadership</br> situation has gone ignored.",

                "For example, if the leader is able to commit to a mixed strategy in the original game, then every one of the (continuum of) mixed strategies constitutes a pure strategy in the extensive-form representation of the <br>leadership</br> situation. (We note that a commitment to a distribution is not the same as a distribution over commitments.)",
                "Moreover, if the original game is itself an extensive-form game, the number of strategies in the extensive-form representation of the <br>leadership</br> situation (which is a different extensive-form game) becomes even larger.",
                "Because of this, it is usually not computationally feasible to simply transform the original game into the extensive-form representation of the <br>leadership</br> situation; instead, we have to analyze the game in its original representation.",
                "In this paper, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to, both in normal-form games (Section 2) and in Bayesian games, which are a special case of extensiveform games (Section 3). 2.",
                "NORMAL-FORM GAMES In this section, we study how to compute the optimal strategy to commit to for games represented in normal form. 2.1 Definitions In a normal-form game, every player i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a set of pure strategies (or actions) Si, and a utility function ui : S1×S2×. . .×Sn → R that maps every outcome (a vector consisting of a pure strategy for every player, also known as a profile of pure strategies) to a real number.",
                "To ease notation, in the case of two players, we will refer to player 1s pure strategy set as S, and player 2s pure strategy set as T. Such games can be represented in (bi-)matrix form, in which the rows correspond to player 1s pure strategies, the columns correspond to player 2s pure strategies, and the entries of the matrix give the row and column players utilities (in that order) for the corresponding outcome of the game.",
                "In the case of three players, we will use R, S, and T, for player 1, 2, and 3s pure strategies, respectively.",
                "A mixed strategy for a player is a probability distribution over that players pure strategies.",
                "In the case of two-player games, we will refer to player 1 as the leader and player 2 as the follower.",
                "Before defining optimal <br>leadership</br> strategies, consider the following game which illustrates the effect of the leaders ability to commit. 2, 1 4, 0 1, 0 3, 1 In this normal-form representation, the bottom strategy for the row player is strictly dominated by the top strategy.",
                "Nevertheless, if the row player has the ability to commit to a pure strategy before the column player chooses his strategy, the row player should commit to the bottom strategy: doing so will make the column player prefer to play the right strategy, leading to a utility of 3 for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if the row player were to commit to the top strategy, the column player would prefer to play the left strategy, leading to a utility of only 2 for the row player.",
                "If the row player is able to commit to a mixed strategy, then she can get an even greater (expected) utility: if the row player commits to placing probability p > 1/2 on the bottom strategy, then the column player will still prefer to play the right strategy, and the row players expected utility will be 3p + 4(1 − p) = 4 − p ≥ 3.",
                "If the row player plays each strategy with probability exactly 1/2, the column player is 83 indifferent between the strategies.",
                "In such cases, we will assume that the column player will choose the strategy that maximizes the row players utility (in this case, the right strategy).",
                "Hence, the optimal mixed strategy to commit to for the row player is p = 1/2.",
                "There are a few good reasons for this assumption.",
                "If we were to assume the opposite, then there would not exist an optimal strategy for the row player in the example game: the row player would play the bottom strategy with probability p = 1/2 + with > 0, and the smaller , the better the utility for the row player.",
                "By contrast, if we assume that the follower always breaks ties in the leaders favor, then an optimal mixed strategy for the leader always exists, and this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium of the extensive-form representation of the <br>leadership</br> situation.",
                "In any case, this is a standard assumption for such models (e.g. [20]), although some work has investigated what can happen in the other subgame perfect equilibria [26]. (For generic two-player games, the leaders subgame-perfect equilibrium payoff is unique.)",
                "Also, the same assumption is typically used in mechanism design, in that it is assumed that if an agent is indifferent between revealing his preferences truthfully and revealing them falsely, he will report them truthfully.",
                "Given this assumption, we can safely refer to optimal <br>leadership</br> strategies rather than having to use some equilibrium notion.",
                "Hence, for the purposes of this paper, an optimal strategy to commit to in a 2-player game is a strategy s ∈ S that maximizes maxt∈BR(s) ul(s, t), where BR(s) = arg maxt∈T uf (s, t). (ul and uf are the leader and followers utility functions, respectively.)",
                "We can have S = S for the case of commitment to pure strategies, or S = ∆(S), the set of probability distributions over S, for the case of commitment to mixed strategies. (We note that replacing T by ∆(T) makes no difference in this definition.)",
                "For games with more than two players, in which the players commit to their strategies in sequence, we define optimal strategies to commit to recursively.",
                "After the leader commits to a strategy, the game to be played by the remaining agents is itself a (smaller) <br>leadership</br> game.",
                "Thus, we define an optimal strategy to commit to as a strategy that maximizes the leaders utility, assuming that the play of the remaining agents is itself optimal under this definition, and maximizes the leaders utility among all optimal ways to play the remaining game.",
                "Again, commitment to mixed strategies may or may not be a possibility for every player (although for the last player it does not matter if we allow for commitment to mixed strategies). 2.2 Commitment to pure strategies We first study how to compute the optimal pure strategy to commit to.",
                "This is relatively simple, because the number of strategies to commit to is not very large. (In the following, #outcomes is the number of complete strategy profiles.)",

                "Proof.",
                "Each pure strategy that the first player may commit to will induce a subgame for the remaining players.",
                "We can solve each such subgame recursively to find all of its optimal strategy profiles; each of these will give the original leader some utility.",
                "Those that give the leader maximal utility correspond exactly to the optimal strategy profiles of the original game.",
                "We now present the algorithm formally.",

                "To do so, we generalize the linear program as follows: maximize θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S pθl s uθl l (s, t) subject to for all t ∈ T, θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t) ≥ θl∈Θl π(θl) s∈S p θl s uf (s, t ) for all θl ∈ Θl, s∈S p θl s = 1 As in Theorem 2, the solution for the linear program that maximizes the solution value is an optimal strategy to commit to.",
                "This shows an interesting contrast between commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in Bayesian games: for pure strategies, the problem becomes easy if the leader has only a single type (but not if the follower has only a single type), whereas for mixed strategies, the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single type (but not if the leader has only a single type). 4.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously.",
                "This requires some equilibrium notion (Nash equilibrium and its refinements), and often leads to the equilibrium selection problem: it is unclear to each individual player according to which equilibrium she should play.",
                "However, this model is not always realistic.",
                "In many settings, one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision.",
                "For example, one agent may arrive at the (real or virtual) site of the game before the other, or, in the specific case of software agents, the code for one agent may be completed and committed before that of another agent.",
                "Such models are synonymously referred to as <br>leadership</br>, commitment, or Stackelberg models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",
                "Specifically, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (optimal) commitment never hurts the leader, and often helps.",
                "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored <br>leadership</br> models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a <br>leadership</br> position).",
                "In this paper, we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games.",
                "For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any number of players.",
                "An optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two players using linear programming (and no more efficiently than that, in the sense that any linear program with a probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of minimax strategies in normal-form games.)",
                "The problem becomes NP-hard for three (or more) players.",
                "In Bayesian games, the problem of finding an optimal pure strategy to commit to is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the follower has only a single type, although two-player games in which the leader has only a single type can be solved efficiently.",
                "The problem of finding an optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a Bayesian game is NP-hard even in two-player games in which the leader has only a single type, although two-player games in which the follower has only a single type can be solved efficiently using a generalization of the linear progamming approach for normal-form games.",
                "The following two tables summarize these results. 2 players ≥ 3 players normal-form O(#outcomes) O(#outcomes· #players) Bayesian, O(#outcomes· NP-hard 1-type leader #types) Bayesian, NP-hard NP-hard 1-type follower Bayesian (general) NP-hard NP-hard Results for commitment to pure strategies.

                "Future research can take a number of directions.",
                "First, we can empirically evaluate the techniques presented here on test suites such as GAMUT [19].",
                "We can also study the computation of optimal strategies to commit to in other1 concise representations of normal-form games-for example, in graphical games [10] or local-effect/action graph games [14, 1].",
                "For the cases where computing an optimal strategy to commit to is NP-hard, we can also study the computation of approximately optimal strategies to commit to.",
                "While the correct definition of an approximately optimal strategy is in this setting may appear simple at first-it should be a strategy that, if the following players play optimally, performs almost as well as the optimal strategy in expectation-this definition becomes problematic when we consider that the other players may also be playing only approximately optimally.",
                "One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time.",
                "Another interesting direction to pursue is to see if computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to can help us in, or otherwise shed light on, computing Nash equilibria.",
                "Often, optimal mixed strategies to commit to are also Nash equilibrium strategies (for example, in two-player zero-sum games this is always true), although this is not always the case (for example, as we already pointed out, sometimes the optimal strategy to commit to is a strictly dominated strategy, which can never be a Nash equilibrium strategy). 5.",

                "This shows an interesting contrast between commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies in Bayesian games: for pure strategies, the problem becomes easy if the leader has only a single type (but not if the follower has only a single type), whereas for mixed strategies, the problem becomes easy if the follower has only a single type (but not if the leader has only a single type). 4.",
                "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH In multiagent systems, strategic settings are often analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously.",

                "Such models are synonymously referred to as leadership, commitment, or <br>stackelberg</br> models, and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously.",
                "Specifically, if commitment to mixed strategies is possible, then (optimal) commitment never hurts the leader, and often helps.",
                "The recent surge in interest in computing game-theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models (with the exception of the interest in mechanism design, where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position).",
                "In this paper, we studied how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both commitment to pure strategies and commitment to mixed strategies, in both normal-form and Bayesian games.",
                "For normal-form games, we showed that the optimal pure strategy to commit to can be found efficiently for any number of players.",
                "An optimal mixed strategy to commit to in a normal-form game can be found efficiently for two players using linear programming (and no more efficiently than that, in the sense that any linear program with a probability constraint can be encoded as such a problem). (This is a generalization of the polynomial-time computability of minimax strategies in normal-form games.)",

                "One may also study models in which multiple (but not all) players commit at the same time.",
