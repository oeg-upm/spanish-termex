Such a sensor network achieves a certain level of detection performance with an associated cost of deployment. This paper addresses this problem by proposing path exposure as a measure of the goodness of a deployment and presents an approach for sequential deployment in steps. It illustrates that the cost of deployment can be minimized to achieve the desired detection performance by appropriately choosing the number of sensors deployed in each step.

INTRODUCTION Recent advances in computing hardware and software are responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of observing the environment, processing the data and making decisions based on the observations. Such a network can be used to monitor the environment, detect, classify and locate specific events, and track targets over a specific region. Examples of such systems are in surveillance, monitoring of pollution, traffic, agriculture or civil infrastructures [6]. The deployment of sensor networks varies with the application considered. It can be predetermined when the environment is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the sensors can be strategically hand placed. The deployment can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means, generally resulting in a random placement. This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor networks performing target detection over a region of interest. In order to detect a target moving through the region, sensors have to make local observations of the environment and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the status of the region covered [2]. This collaboration requires local processing of the observations, communication between different nodes, and information fusion [7]. Since the local observations made by the sensors depend on their position, the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of the deployment. One possible measure of the goodness of deployment for target detection is called path exposure. It is a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing the region using a given path. The higher the path exposure, the better the deployment. The set of paths to be considered may be constrained by the environment. For example, if the target is expected to be following a road, only the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered. In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random which corresponds to many practical applications where the region to be monitored is not accessible for precise placement of sensors. The focus of this paper is to determine the number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target detection in a region of interest. The tradeoffs lie between the network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and the cost of deploying the sensors. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, a definition for path exposure is proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given path is developed. In section 3, the problem of random deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented. An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4 and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given environment. The paper concludes with section 7. 2. PATH EXPOSURE In this section, a model for sensor network target detection is proposed, a definition of path exposure is presented and expressions for evaluating this path exposure are developed. 2.1 Model Consider a rectangular sensor field with n sensors de42 ployed at locations si, i = 1, . . . , n. A target at location u emits a signal which is measured by the sensors. The signal from the target decays as a polynomial of the distance. If the decay coefficient is k, the signal energy of a target at location u measured by the sensor at si is given by Si(u) = K ||u − si||k (1) where K is the energy emitted by the target and ||u − si|| is the geometric distance between the target and the sensor. Depending on the environment the value k typically ranges from 2.0 to 5.0 [4]. Energy measurements at a sensor are usually corrupted by noise. If Ni denotes the noise energy at sensor i during a particular measurement, then the total energy measured at sensor i, when the target is at location u, is Ei(u) = Si(u) + Ni = K ||u − si||k + Ni. The sensors collaborate to arrive at a consensus decision as to whether a target is present in the region. We consider two basic approaches for reaching this consensus: Value fusion and Decision fusion [3]. In value fusion, one of the sensors gathers the energy measurements from the other sensors, totals up the energy and compares the sum to a threshold to decide whether a target is present. If the sum exceeds the threshold, then the consensus decision is that a target is present. In contrast, in decision fusion, each individual sensor compares its energy measurement to a threshold to arrive at a local decision as to whether a target is present. The local decisions (1 for target present and 0 otherwise) from the sensors are totaled at a sensor and the sum is compared to another threshold to arrive at the consensus decision. In some situations, value fusion outperforms decision fusion and vice versa. 2.1.1 Value Fusion. The probability of consensus target detection when the target is at location u is Dv(u) = Prob n i=1 K ||u − si||k + Ni ≥ η = Prob n i=1 Ni ≥ η − n i=1 K ||u − si||k , where η is the value fusion threshold. If the noise processes at the sensors are independent, then the probability density function of n i=1 Ni equals the convolution of the probability density function of Ni, i = 1, . . . , n. In particular, if the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), then n i=1 Ni has a Chi-square distribution of degree n. Due to the presence of noise, the sensors may incorrectly decide that a target is present even though there is no target in the field. The probability of a consensus false target detection is Fv = Prob n i=1 Ni ≥ η . (2) As above, if the noise processes at the sensors are independent and AWGN, then the false alarm probability can be computed from the Chi-square distribution of degree n. 2.1.2 Decision Fusion. For decision fusion, the probability of consensus target detection when the target is located at u is Dd(u) = Prob n i=1 hd,i(u) ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · P1 j · P0 (n−j) where P1 = Prob [hd,i(u) = 1] = Prob Ni ≥ η1 − K ||u − si||k and P0 = Prob [hd,i(u) = 0] = 1 − Prob [hd,i(u) = 1] . can be computed from Chi-square distribution of degree 1 for AWGN noise process. The probability of false target detection at sensor i is Prob[gd,i = 1] = Prob[Ni ≥ η1] and Prob[gd,i = 0] = 1 − Prob[gd,i = 1]. Therefore, the probability of consensus false target detection is Fd = Prob n i=1 gd,i ≥ η2 = n j=η2 n j · (Prob [gd,i = 1])j · (Prob [gd,i = 0])(n−j) The above equations serve as an analytic basis for evaluating exposure as defined in the following subsection. Note that in value and decision fusion the knowledge of the sensors location can be used to make the detection decision. For example, a sensor can report values that differ substantially from its neighbors values. This discrepancy can be analyzed to avoid false alarms or misses and therefore improve the detection performance. However, such algorithms are not considered in this paper. 2.2 De£nition of exposure We define exposure to be the probability of detecting the target or an intruder carrying out the unauthorized activity, where the activity depends on the problem under consideration. In this paper, the activity considered is the Unauthorized Traversal (UT) as defined below. Unauthorized Traversal (UT) Problem: We are given a sensor field with n sensors at locations s1, s2, . . . , sn (see Figure 1). We are also given the stochastic characterization of the noise at each sensor and a tolerable bound, α, on the false alarm probability. Let P denote a path from the west to the east periphery of the sensor field. A target traversing the sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some point u ∈ P. The exposure of path P is the net probability of detecting a target that traverses the field using P. The target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the field and the problem is to find the path P with the least exposure. 43 Sensor Figure 1: Example sensor fields for UT problem. 2.3 Solution to the UT problem Let P denote a path from the west to the east periphery through the sensor field. A target that traverses the field using P is not detected if and only if it is not detected at any time while it is on that path. Since detection attempts by the sensor network occur at a fixed frequency, we can associate each detection attempt with a point u ∈ P when assuming that the target traverses the field at a constant speed. The detection attempts are based on energy measured over a period of time T during which the target is moving. Therefore, the detection probability associated with each point u reflects the measurements performed during time T. Considering the path, the net probability of not detecting a target traversing the field using P is the product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u ∈ P. That is, if G(P) denotes the net probability of not detecting a target as it traverses over path P, then, log G(P) = u∈P log(1 − D(u))du, where D(u) is either Dv(u) of Dd(u) depending on whether the sensors use value or decision fusion to arrive at a consensus decision. Since the exposure of P is (1 − G(P)), the problem is to find the path which minimizes (1 − G(P)) or equivalently the path that minimizes | log G(P)|1 . In general, the path P that minimizes | log G(P)| can be fairly arbitrary in shape. The proposed solution does not exactly compute this path. Instead, we rely on the following approximation. We first divide the sensor field into a fine grid and then assume that the target only moves along this grid. The problem then is to find the path P on this grid that minimizes | log G(P)|. Note that, the finer the grid the closer the approximation. Also, one can use higher order grids such as in [5] instead of the rectangular grid we use in this paper. The higher order grids change the runtime of the algorithm but the approach is the same as with the rectangular grid. For the target not to be detected at any point u ∈ P, 1 Note that, G(P) lies between 0 and 1 and thus log G(P) is negative. 1. Generate a suitably fine rectangular grid. 2. For each line segment l between adjacent grid points 3. Compute | log ml| using Equation 3 4. Assign l a weight equal to | log ml| 5. Endfor 6. Add a link from virtual point a to each grid point on the west 7. Add a link from virtual point b to each grid point on the east 8. Assign a weight of 0 to all the line segments from a and b 9. Compute the least weight path P from a to b using Dijkstras algorithm 10. Let w equal the total weight of P. 11. Return P as the least exposure path with an exposure equal to 10−w . Figure 2: Pseudo-code of the proposed solution for the UT problem. it need not be detected at any point u lying between any two adjacent grid points of P. We therefore subdivide any path P as a chain of grid segments. Let us consider two adjacent points, say v1 and v2 on the grid. Let l denote the line segment between v1 and v2. Also, let ml denote the probability of not detecting a target traveling between v1 and v2 on the line segment l. Then, from the discussion above, log ml = u∈l log(1 − D(u))du (3) The probability ml can be evaluated by finding the detection probability D(u) at each point u ∈ l. Note that, ml lies between 0 and 1 and, therefore, log ml is negative. To find the least exposed path, a non-negative weight equal to | log ml| is assigned to each segment l on this grid. Also, a fictitious point a is created and a line segment is added from a to each grid point on the west periphery of the sensor field. A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments. Similarly, a fictitious point b is created and a line segment is added from b to each grid point on the east periphery of the sensor field. A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of these line segments. The problem of finding the least exposed path from west periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid. Such a path can be efficiently determined using the Dijkstras shortest path algorithm [1]. A pseudo-code of the overall algorithm is shown in Figure 2. Example: Figure 3 shows a sensor field with eight sensors at locations marked by dark circles. Assume the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. Further assume that the sensors use value fusion to arrive at a consensus decision. Then, from Equation 2, we chose a threshold η = 3.0 to achieve a false alarm probability of 0.187%. The field has been divided into a 10 × 10 grid. The target emits an energy K = 12 and the energy decay factor is 2. The figure shows the weight assigned to each line segment in the grid as described above. The least exposure path found by the Dijkstras algorithm for this weighted grid is highlighted.

DEPLOYMENT In this section, the problem of sensor deployment for unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are identified. 3.1 Problem formulation Consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized traversal using a sensor network. The target to traverse the sensor field emits a given energy level K and the stochastic of the noise in the region is known. The sensors are to be deployed over the region in a random fashion where the sensors locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the number or density of sensors can be chosen. The problem is to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the region. This performance is measured by the false alarm probability and the path exposure defined in section 2. The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms. It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate. Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region. Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region. However, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors. Indeed some sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability, in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same vicinity. A study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved. In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate. 3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used. Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors. To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position. The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level. If it does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available sensors are deployed. The number of sensors used in this strategy can be minimized by deploying one sensor at a time. However, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors. By assigning a cost to both single sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined. In the next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding the optimal solution. In general, the optimal cost solution is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all the sensors at a time. 4. ANALYTICAL SOLUTION In this section, we derive an analytical model for the cost of deployment. Let ed be the desired minimum exposure for the sensor network to be deployed when a maximum of M sensors are available for deployment.

Let Fn(x) denote the cumulative distribution function of e, that is the probability that e is less than x, when n sensors are deployed. As mentioned in the previous section, there is no a priori guarantee that the exposure ed will be obtained when deploying the sensors. If M is the maximum number of sensors available, the confidence of obtaining a least exposure of ed or more is 1−FM (ed). For the proposed solution, we assume that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the minimum exposure ed is not reached. To evaluate the probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment, we make the following approximation: the distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. This is an approximation since the exposure obtained with n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with only k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. We observed that the re-deployment of just a few sensors can substantially modify the coverage of the region, for example when filling empty spaces. The approximation is also justified by the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions. Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many different deployment positions, some of which can be easily improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g. when there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors (e.g. when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region). As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M. Note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensors deployed at step i. Also let Cd be the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and Cs be the cost of each sensor. If the desired exposure is obtained after the first step, the cost of deployment is Cd + n1Cs, and this 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Number of sensors Probability ed =95% ed =90% ed =85% ed =80% Figure 5: Probability that the minimum exposure is above ed for varying number of sensors and ed=80%,85%,90% and 95%. event happens with probability 1 − Fn1 (ed).

SIMULATION In this section, we present results of simulations that were conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of the number of sensors deployed. 5.1 Method The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a predefined region. The random deployment is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local approximation. For every deployment, the minimum exposure is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm presented in section 2. A decay factor of k = 2 and maximum energy of K = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted by targets (cf Equation 1). The region monitored is of size 20×20 with a noise (AWGN) of variance 1, so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 8 or more units length away from a sensor. The sensors use value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision on the presence of a target in the region. The threshold for detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors to give a constant false alarm probability. The false alarm probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of length 20 units (corresponding to 20 detection attempts by the sensors) is 5%. 46 0 20 40 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Cost for Cd=0 and Cs=1 n Expectedcost 0 20 40 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Cost for Cd=5 and Cs=1 n Expectedcost 0 20 40 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Cost for Cd=100 and Cs=1 n Expectedcost Figure 6: Expected cost of achieving minimum exposure of 95% as function of the number of sensors for three different cost assignments. 5.2 Distribution of minimum exposure The distribution of minimum exposure were found for the number of sensor deployed varying from 1 to 40. To illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10 and 15 sensors are shown in Figure 4. We observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm probability of .04. The highest density is obtained for values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero for higher values of exposure. For deployment of 10 sensors, we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density for values below .04, then increases and has about constant density for values lying between .1 and .98. We also observe a peak of density around 1. For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure. The density slowly increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1. As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases. When randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure. When deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a desirable exposure level. When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed. We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of sensors. The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%. These values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in Equation 4. The graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed. The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 6. RESULTS In this section, we evaluate the expected cost of deploying sensors using the simulation results. The optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results. For this cost analysis, the region parameters and signal model are the same as specified in section 5. We further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S. In this case, Equation 4 reduces to E{C} = (Cd + n.Cs) S−1 i=1 i. i−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (1 − Fi.n(ed)) + (S.Cd + M.Cs) S−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (5) We evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of ed = 95%. The three corresponding graphs are shown in Figure 6. The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95%. Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesnt affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph. Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis. The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step. For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease. This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights. The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs). In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19. Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights. The last cost assignment is (Cd = 100, Cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved when deploying 27 sensors at every step. These results are specific to the region and the parameters characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were chosen for the simulation. Similar results can be derived for other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the exposure distributions through simulation. 7. CONCLUSION This paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment in a region to be monitored for target intrusion. A mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths through the region. The minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region. In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed. The strategy consists of deploying a limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved. The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment. Through simulation, the distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed. These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step. We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to deployment and sensors. The results of this study can be extended to larger regions with different target parameters. The solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step and this multiple variables problem requires further investigation. 8.

Introducción Los avances recientes en la computación hardware y software son responsables de la aparición de redes de sensores capaces de observar el entorno, procesar los datos y tomar decisiones basadas en las observaciones. Dicha red se puede utilizar para monitorear el entorno, detectar, clasificar y localizar eventos específicos, y rastrear objetivos en una región específica. Ejemplos de tales sistemas están en vigilancia, monitoreo de la contaminación, tráfico, agricultura o infraestructuras civiles [6]. La implementación de redes de sensores varía con la aplicación considerada. Se puede predeterminar cuando el entorno es suficientemente conocido y bajo control, en cuyo caso los sensores pueden colocarse estratégicamente a mano. El despliegue también puede ser a priori indeterminado cuando el entorno es desconocido o hostil, en cuyo caso los sensores pueden ser acumulados por un avión o desplegado por otros medios, lo que generalmente resulta en una ubicación aleatoria. Este documento investiga las estrategias de implementación para las redes de sensores que realizan la detección de objetivos sobre una región de interés. Para detectar un objetivo que se mueve a través de la región, los sensores deben hacer observaciones locales del medio ambiente y colaborar para producir una decisión global que refleje el estado de la región cubierta [2]. Esta colaboración requiere el procesamiento local de las observaciones, la comunicación entre diferentes nodos y la fusión de información [7]. Dado que las observaciones locales realizadas por los sensores dependen de su posición, el rendimiento del algoritmo de detección es una función de la implementación. Una posible medida de la bondad del despliegue para la detección de objetivos se llama exposición a la ruta. Es una medida de la probabilidad de detectar un objetivo que atraviese la región utilizando una ruta dada. Cuanto mayor sea la exposición a la ruta, mejor será la implementación. El conjunto de rutas a considerar puede estar limitado por el medio ambiente. Por ejemplo, si se espera que el objetivo esté siguiendo una carretera, solo se deben considerar los caminos que consisten en las carreteras. En este estudio, se supone que la implementación es aleatoria, lo que corresponde a muchas aplicaciones prácticas donde la región a ser monitoreada no es accesible para la colocación precisa de los sensores. El enfoque de este documento es determinar el número de sensores que se implementarán para llevar a cabo la detección de objetivos en una región de interés. Las compensaciones se encuentran entre el rendimiento de la red, el costo de los sensores desplegados y el costo de implementar los sensores. Este artículo está organizado de la siguiente forma: En la Sección 2, se propone una definición de exposición a la ruta y se desarrolla un método para evaluar la exposición de una ruta dada. En la Sección 3, se formula el problema de la implementación aleatoria y se presentan varias soluciones. Un estudio analítico de estas soluciones se proporciona en la Sección 4 y la Sección 5 presenta resultados de simulación que se utilizan en la Sección 6 para determinar la solución óptima para un entorno dado. El documento concluye con la Sección 7. 2. Exposición a la ruta En esta sección, se propone un modelo para la detección del objetivo de la red de sensores, se presenta una definición de exposición a la ruta y se desarrollan expresiones para evaluar esta exposición de la ruta.2.1 Modelo Considere un campo de sensor rectangular con N sensores DE42 empleados en las ubicaciones si, i = 1 ,..., n.Un objetivo en la ubicación U emite una señal que mide los sensores. La señal del objetivo decae como un polinomio de la distancia. Si el coeficiente de descomposición es k, la energía de la señal de un objetivo en la ubicación u medido por el sensor en si viene dada por si (u) = k || u - si || k (1) donde k es la energía emitida por elobjetivo y || u - si ||es la distancia geométrica entre el objetivo y el sensor. Dependiendo del entorno, el valor K típicamente varía de 2.0 a 5.0 [4]. Las mediciones de energía en un sensor generalmente se corrompen por el ruido. Si Ni denota la energía de ruido en el sensor I durante una medición particular, entonces la energía total medida en el sensor I, cuando el objetivo está en la ubicación U, es ei (u) = si (u) + ni = k || u - si|| k + ni. Los sensores colaboran para llegar a una decisión de consenso sobre si un objetivo está presente en la región. Consideramos dos enfoques básicos para llegar a este consenso: fusión de valor y fusión de decisión [3]. En la fusión de valor, uno de los sensores reúne las mediciones de energía de los otros sensores, totaliza la energía y compara la suma con un umbral para decidir si hay un objetivo presente. Si la suma excede el umbral, la decisión de consenso es que un objetivo está presente. Por el contrario, en la fusión de la decisión, cada sensor individual compara su medición de energía con un umbral para llegar a una decisión local sobre si un objetivo está presente. Las decisiones locales (1 para el objetivo presente y 0 de lo contrario) de los sensores se totalizan en un sensor y la suma se compara con otro umbral para llegar a la decisión de consenso. En algunas situaciones, el valor de la fusión supera a la fusión de decisiones y viceversa.2.1.1 Fusión de valor. La probabilidad de detección del objetivo de consenso cuando el objetivo está en la ubicación u es dv (u) = prob n i = 1 k || u - si || k + ni ≥ η = prob n i = 1 ni ≥ η - n i = 1 k || u - si || k, donde η es el umbral de fusión de valor. Si los procesos de ruido en los sensores son independientes, entonces la función de densidad de probabilidad de N i = 1 Ni es igual a la convolución de la función de densidad de probabilidad de Ni, i = 1 ,..., n.En particular, si el proceso de ruido en cada sensor es el ruido gaussiano blanco aditivo (AWGN), entonces n i = 1 Ni tiene una distribución de chi-cuadrado de grado n.Debido a la presencia de ruido, los sensores pueden decidir incorrectamente que hay un objetivo presente a pesar de que no hay un objetivo en el campo. La probabilidad de una detección de objetivo falso de consenso es FV = Prob n i = 1 Ni ≥ η.(2) Como se indicó anteriormente, si los procesos de ruido en los sensores son independientes y AWGN, entonces la probabilidad de falsa alarma se puede calcular a partir de la distribución de chi-cuadrado de grado n.2.1.2 Fusión de decisión. Para la fusión de la decisión, la probabilidad de detección del objetivo de consenso cuando el objetivo se encuentra en U es DD (u) = prob n i = 1 hd, i (u) ≥ η2 = n j = η2 n j · p1 j · p0 (n - j)donde p1 = prob [hd, i (u) = 1] = prob Ni ≥ η1 - k || u - si || k y p0 = prob [hd, i (u) = 0] = 1 - prob [hd,i (u) = 1].se puede calcular a partir de la distribución de chi-cuadrado del grado 1 para el proceso de ruido AWGN. La probabilidad de detección del objetivo falso en el sensor I es Prob [GD, I = 1] = Prob [Ni ≥ η1] y Prob [GD, I = 0] = 1 - Prob [GD, I = 1]. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de detección del objetivo falso consenso es fd = prob n i = 1 gd, i ≥ η2 = n j = η2 n j · (prob [gd, i = 1]) j · (prob [gd, i = 0]) (n - j) Las ecuaciones anteriores sirven como base analítica para evaluar la exposición como se define en la siguiente subsección. Tenga en cuenta que en el valor y la fusión de la decisión, el conocimiento de la ubicación de los sensores se puede utilizar para tomar la decisión de detección. Por ejemplo, un sensor puede informar valores que difieren sustancialmente de los valores de sus vecinos. Esta discrepancia se puede analizar para evitar falsas alarmas o fallas y, por lo tanto, mejorar el rendimiento de detección. Sin embargo, tales algoritmos no se consideran en este documento.2.2 De £ nition de la exposición, definimos la exposición para que sea la probabilidad de detectar el objetivo o un intruso que realiza la actividad no autorizada, donde la actividad depende del problema bajo consideración. En este artículo, la actividad considerada es el recorrido no autorizado (UT) como se define a continuación. Problema de recorrido no autorizado (UT): se nos da un campo de sensor con N sensores en las ubicaciones S1, S2 ,..., Sn (ver Figura 1). También se nos da la caracterización estocástica del ruido en cada sensor y un límite tolerable, α, en la probabilidad de falsa alarma. Deje que P denote un camino de Occidente a la periferia este del campo del sensor. Se detecta un objetivo que atraviesa el campo del sensor usando la ruta P si se detecta en algún punto u ∈ P. La exposición de la ruta P es la probabilidad neta de detectar un objetivo que atraviesa el campo usando P. se supone que el objetivo es capaz de ser capaz deSiga cualquier camino a través del campo y el problema es encontrar la ruta P con la menor exposición.43 Sensor Figura 1: Campos de sensor de ejemplo para el problema de UT.2.3 Solución al problema UT Deja que P denote un camino desde Occidente hasta la periferia este a través del campo del sensor. Un objetivo que atraviesa el campo usando P no se detecta si y solo si no se detecta en ningún momento mientras está en ese camino. Dado que los intentos de detección de la red de sensores ocurren a una frecuencia fija, podemos asociar cada intento de detección con un punto u ∈ P al suponer que el objetivo atraviesa el campo a una velocidad constante. Los intentos de detección se basan en la energía medida durante un período de tiempo T durante el cual se mueve el objetivo. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de detección asociada con cada punto U refleja las mediciones realizadas durante el tiempo T. Teniendo en cuenta la ruta, la probabilidad neta de no detectar un objetivo que atraviesa el campo usando P es el producto de las probabilidades de no detección en cada punto u ∈ P. Es decir, si G (p) denota la probabilidad neta de no detectar un objetivo a medida que atraviesa la ruta P, entonces, log g (p) = u∈P log (1 - d (u)) du, donde d ((U) es DV (U) de DD (u) dependiendo de si los sensores usan el valor o la fusión de decisión para llegar a una decisión de consenso. Dado que la exposición de P es (1 - g (p)), el problema es encontrar la ruta que minimiza (1 - g (p)) o de manera equivalente la ruta que minimiza |log g (p) | 1. En general, la ruta P que minimiza |log g (p) |puede ser bastante arbitrario de forma. La solución propuesta no calcula exactamente esta ruta. En cambio, confiamos en la siguiente aproximación. Primero dividimos el campo del sensor en una cuadrícula fina y luego asumimos que el objetivo solo se mueve a lo largo de esta cuadrícula. El problema es encontrar la ruta P en esta cuadrícula que minimiza |log g (p) |. Tenga en cuenta que, cuanto más fino sea la cuadrícula, más cerca será la aproximación. Además, uno puede usar cuadrículas de orden superior, como en [5] en lugar de la cuadrícula rectangular que usamos en este documento. Las cuadrículas de orden superior cambian el tiempo de ejecución del algoritmo, pero el enfoque es el mismo que con la cuadrícula rectangular. Para que el objetivo no se detecte en ningún punto u ∈ P, 1 Tenga en cuenta que, G (P) se encuentra entre 0 y 1 y, por lo tanto, log G (P) es negativo.1. Genere una cuadrícula rectangular adecuadamente fina.2. Para cada segmento de línea L entre los puntos de cuadrícula adyacentes 3. Calcular |Log ML |Usando la ecuación 3 4.

Devolver P como la ruta de exposición menor con una exposición igual a 10 - W. Figura 2: Pseudo-código de la solución propuesta para el problema de UT.No necesita ser detectado en ningún punto U que se encuentre entre dos puntos de cuadrícula adyacentes de P. Por lo tanto, subdividimos cualquier camino P como una cadena de segmentos de cuadrícula. Consideremos dos puntos adyacentes, digamos V1 y V2 en la cuadrícula. Deje que L denote el segmento de línea entre V1 y V2. Además, deje que ML denote la probabilidad de no detectar un objetivo que viaja entre V1 y V2 en el segmento de línea L.Luego, a partir de la discusión anterior, log ml = u∈L log (1 - d (u)) du (3) La probabilidad ML puede evaluarse encontrando la probabilidad de detección d (u) en cada punto u ∈ L.Tenga en cuenta que ML se encuentra entre 0 y 1 y, por lo tanto, el registro ML es negativo. Para encontrar el camino menos expuesto, un peso no negativo igual a |Log ML |se asigna a cada segmento L en esta cuadrícula. Además, se crea un punto A ficticio y se agrega un segmento de línea de A a cada punto de cuadrícula en la periferia oeste del campo del sensor. Se asigna un peso igual a 0 a cada uno de estos segmentos de línea. Del mismo modo, se crea un punto F ficticio B y se agrega un segmento de línea de B a cada punto de cuadrícula en la periferia este del campo del sensor. Se asigna un peso igual a 0 a cada uno de estos segmentos de línea. El problema de encontrar el camino menos expuesto desde la periferia oeste hasta la periferia este es equivalente al problema de encontrar el camino de menor peso de A a B en esta cuadrícula. Tal ruta puede determinarse de manera eficiente utilizando el algoritmo de ruta más corta de Dijkstras [1]. En la Figura 2 se muestra un pseudocódigo del algoritmo general. Ejemplo: La Figura 3 muestra un campo de sensor con ocho sensores en ubicaciones marcadas por círculos oscuros. Suponga que el proceso de ruido en cada sensor es gaussiano blanco aditivo con media 0 y varianza 1. Además, suponga que los sensores usan el valor de la fusión para llegar a una decisión de consenso. Luego, de la ecuación 2, elegimos un umbral η = 3.0 para lograr una probabilidad de falsa alarma de 0.187%. El campo se ha dividido en una cuadrícula de 10 × 10. El objetivo emite una energía K = 12 y el factor de descomposición de energía es 2. La figura muestra el peso asignado a cada segmento de línea en la cuadrícula como se describió anteriormente. Se resalta la ruta de menor exposición encontrada por el algoritmo Dijkstras para esta cuadrícula ponderada.

Despliegue En esta sección, se formula el problema del despliegue del sensor para la detección transversal no autorizada y se identifican soluciones.3.1 Formulación de problemas Considere una región que se debe monitorear para un recorrido no autorizado utilizando una red de sensores. Se conoce el objetivo para atravesar el campo del sensor emite un nivel de energía K y el estocástico del ruido en la región. Los sensores se implementarán sobre la región de una manera aleatoria donde las ubicaciones de los sensores en la región son a priori indeterminadas y solo se puede elegir el número o densidad de los sensores. El problema es encontrar una estrategia de implementación que resulte en un nivel de rendimiento deseado en el monitoreo transversal no autorizado de la región. Este rendimiento se mide por la probabilidad de falsa alarma y la exposición a la ruta definida en la Sección 2. La probabilidad de falsa alarma no depende de la colocación del sensor y solo está determinada por el número de sensores desplegados y los umbrales utilizados en los algoritmos de detección. Se supone que se soluciona en este estudio para que el problema consista en maximizar la exposición a una tasa de falsa alarma constante. Dado que los objetivos pueden atravesar la región a través de cualquier ruta, el objetivo de despliegue es maximizar la exposición de la ruta menos expuesta en la región. Obviamente, la exposición mínima en la región aumenta (si la tasa de alarma falsa se mantiene constante) a medida que se implementan más sensores en la región. Sin embargo, dado que la implementación es aleatoria, no hay garantías de que el nivel de exposición deseado se logre para un número determinado de sensores. De hecho, algunas ubicaciones de los sensores pueden dar como resultado una capacidad de detección muy pobre, en particular cuando todos los sensores se despliegan en la misma vecindad. Un estudio de la distribución estadística de la exposición para la colocación variable del sensor para un número determinado de sensores puede proporcionar un nivel de confianza que se logra el nivel de detección deseado. En situaciones prácticas, solo hay un número limitado de sensores disponibles para la implementación y solo se puede lograr un nivel de detección limitado con el nivel de confianza asociado a una tasa de falsa alarma dada.3.2 Solución Basado en la discusión anterior, desarrollamos un método de solución para el problema de implementación cuando se puede usar un máximo de sensores M. La implementación de los sensores M da como resultado el nivel de detección máximo alcanzable, pero no es óptimo cuando se considera el costo de los sensores. Para reducir el número de sensores desplegados, solo se puede implementar primero parte de los sensores disponibles y los sensores pueden informar su posición. La colocación del sensor aleatorio obtenida se puede analizar para determinar si satisface el nivel de rendimiento deseado. Si no es así, se pueden implementar sensores adicionales hasta que se alcance el nivel de exposición deseado o hasta que se implementen los sensores de todos los M disponibles. El número de sensores utilizados en esta estrategia se puede minimizar implementando un sensor a la vez. Sin embargo, un costo generalmente se asocia con cada despliegue de sensores y la implementación de un sensor a la vez puede no ser rentable si el costo de la implementación es lo suficientemente grande con respecto al costo de los sensores individuales. Al asignar un costo tanto a los sensores individuales como a la implementación, se puede determinar el número óptimo de sensores que se implementarán al principio y a partir de entonces. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos expresiones analíticas para encontrar la solución óptima. En general, la solución de costo óptima no está implementando un sensor a la vez ni implementar todos los sensores a la vez.4. Solución analítica En esta sección, derivamos un modelo analítico para el costo de implementación. Deje que Ed sea la exposición mínima deseada para la implementación de la red de sensores cuando se esté implementando un máximo de sensores M disponibles para su implementación.

Deje que Fn (x) denote la función de distribución acumulativa de E, es decir, la probabilidad de que E sea menor que x, cuando se implementan los sensores N. Como se mencionó en la sección anterior, no existe una garantía a priori de que la exposición se obtendrá al implementar los sensores. Si M es el número máximo de sensores disponibles, la confianza de obtener una exposición menos de ED o más es 1 - FM (ED). Para la solución propuesta, suponemos que la posición de los sensores obtenidos después de un despliegue se conoce para que se puedan implementar sensores adicionales si no se alcanza la exposición mínima ED. Para evaluar la probabilidad de que se alcance la exposición ED después del despliegue adicional del sensor, realizamos la siguiente aproximación: la distribución de la exposición para los sensores de N es independiente de la exposición correspondiente a K de estos sensores de N, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Esta es una aproximación ya que la exposición obtenida con N sensores es siempre más alta que la exposición obtenida con solo k de estos sensores de N, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Observamos que la redepleación de solo unos pocos sensores puede modificar sustancialmente la cobertura de la región, por ejemplo, al llenar los espacios vacíos. La aproximación también está justificada por la relación suelta entre la exposición y las posiciones de los sensores. De hecho, una exposición mínima dada puede corresponder a muchas posiciones de implementación diferentes, algunas de las cuales pueden mejorarse fácilmente desplegando algunos sensores adicionales (por ejemplo, cuando hay un espacio vacío en la cobertura de la región), algunos de los cuales solo se pueden mejorar al implementarMuchos sensores adicionales (por ejemplo, cuando los sensores se distribuyen uniformemente en la región). Como la exposición mínima E es una variable aleatoria, el costo de implementar los sensores en los pasos hasta que se alcanza la exposición deseada también es una variable aleatoria C. Ahora derivamos la expresión para el valor esperado de C. es el número total deSensores implementados después de cada paso I para un número máximo de pasos s para que ns = M. Tenga en cuenta que Ni - Ni - 1 es el número de sensores implementados en el paso I. También deje que el CD sea el costo de implementar los sensores en cada paso y CS sea el costo de cada sensor. Si la exposición deseada se obtiene después del primer paso, el costo de despliegue es CD + N1CS, y este 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Número de sensores Probabilidad Ed = 95%ED = 90% ED = 85% ED = 80% Figura 5: Probabilidad de que la exposición mínima esté por encima de ED para un número variable de sensores y ED = 80%, 85%, 90% y 95%.El evento ocurre con la probabilidad 1 - FN1 (ed).

Simulación En esta sección, presentamos los resultados de las simulaciones que se realizaron para recolectar la función de distribución de exposición del número de sensores desplegados.5.1 Método La distribución de exposición se obtiene recopilando estadísticas sobre la exposición al implementar sensores aleatoriamente en una región predefinida. Se supone que el despliegue aleatorio se distribuye de manera uniforme sobre la región, que es una aproximación local. Para cada implementación, la exposición mínima se encuentra utilizando un simulador que implementa el algoritmo presentado en la Sección 2. Se elige un factor de descomposición de K = 2 y la energía máxima de K = 60 para modelar la energía emitida por los objetivos (CF Ecuación 1). La región monitoreada es de tamaño 20 × 20 con un ruido (AWGN) de varianza 1, de modo que la señal que proviene del objetivo está cubierta por el ruido cuando el objetivo está a 8 o más unidades de distancia de un sensor. Los sensores usan el valor de la fusión para colaborar al tomar una decisión común sobre la presencia de un objetivo en la región. El umbral para la detección se elige en función del número de sensores para dar una probabilidad constante de falsa alarma. Se elige la probabilidad de falsa alarma para cada intento de detección para que la probabilidad de obtener una o más falsa alarma a lo largo de una ruta de longitud 20 unidades (correspondientes a 20 intentos de detección por los sensores) sea del 5%.46 0 20 40 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Costo para CD = 0 y CS = 1 N Costas esperadas 0 20 40 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Costo para CD = 5 y CS = 1 N Costas esperadas 0 20 40 0 200 400 600800 1000 1200 1400 Costo para CD = 100 y CS = 1 N Costas esperadas Figura 6: Costo esperado de lograr una exposición mínima del 95% como función del número de sensores para tres asignaciones de costos diferentes.5.2 Distribución de la exposición mínima La distribución de la exposición mínima se encontró para el número de sensores desplegados que varían de 1 a 40. Para ilustrar nuestros resultados, las funciones de densidad de probabilidad para los sensores 5, 10 y 15 se muestran en la Figura 4. Observamos que para 5 sensores desplegados, la exposición mínima tiene una densidad cero para valores menores que la probabilidad de falsa alarma de .04. La densidad más alta se obtiene para valores alrededor de .07 y luego cae exponencialmente hacia cero para valores más altos de exposición. Para el despliegue de 10 sensores, encontramos nuevamente que la exposición mínima tiene una densidad cero para valores por debajo de .04, luego aumenta y tiene aproximadamente una densidad constante para valores que se encuentran entre .1 y .98. También observamos un pico de densidad alrededor de 1. Para el despliegue de 15 sensores, las densidades comienzan en cero para valores pequeños y siguen siendo muy pequeños para la mayoría de los valores de exposición mínima. La densidad aumenta lentamente y tiene un pico grande para una exposición mínima de 1. Como se esperaba, la exposición mínima aumenta en promedio a medida que aumenta el número de sensores desplegados. Al implementar aleatoriamente 5 sensores, es muy poco probable que obtenga una ubicación que proporcione una exposición mínima deseable. Al implementar 10 sensores, la mayoría de los niveles de exposición son igualmente probables y solo se da poca confianza para obtener un nivel de exposición deseable. Al implementar 15 sensores, es muy probable que la colocación del sensor ofrezca una buena exposición y esta probabilidad sigue aumentando con la cantidad de sensores desplegados. Utilizamos la función de distribución acumulada obtenida de las estadísticas recopiladas para evaluar la probabilidad de que se obtenga el nivel de exposición deseado para un número variable de sensores. El gráfico de la Figura 5 muestra la probabilidad de que la exposición mínima esté por encima de la DE en función del número de sensores desplegados para ED = 80%, 85%, 90%y 95%. Estos valores pueden usarse para evaluar el costo expresado en la ecuación 4. El gráfico muestra que el nivel de confianza para obtener un nivel de exposición mínimo dado aumenta con el número de sensores implementados. La confianza para la DE al implementar 40 sensores está por encima de .999, lo cual es suficiente para la mayoría de las aplicaciones y, por lo tanto, no evaluamos la distribución de la exposición al implementar más de 40 sensores.6. Resultados en esta sección, evaluamos el costo esperado de implementar sensores utilizando los resultados de la simulación. El número óptimo de sensores para implementar al principio y en los pasos siguientes se puede derivar de estos resultados. Para este análisis de costos, los parámetros de la región y el modelo de señal son los mismos que se especifican en la Sección 5. Además, suponemos que el número de sensores desplegados en cada paso es constante, de modo que ni - ni - 1 = n para todos 1 ≤ i ≤ S. En este caso, la ecuación 4 se reduce a e {c} = (cd + n.cs) S - 1 i = 1 i.i - 1 j = 1 fj.n (ed) (1 - fi.n (ed)) + (s.cd + m.cs) s - 1 j = 1 fj.n (ed) (5) Evaluamos elCosto esperado en función de N para tres asignaciones de costos diferentes con una exposición deseada de ED = 95%. Los tres gráficos correspondientes se muestran en la Figura 6. La primera asignación de costos es (CD = 0, CS = 1) para que el costo esperado sea el número esperado de sensores que se utilizarán para lograr una exposición del 95%. Dado que CD = 0, el número de pasos utilizados para implementar los sensores no afecta el costo y, por lo tanto, es óptimo implementar un sensor a la vez hasta que se alcanza la ED mínima de exposición, como observamos en el gráfico. En general, el número esperado de sensor que se implementa 47 aumenta con N, pero observamos un mínimo local para N = 16 que puede explicarse mediante el siguiente análisis. El número esperado de sensores es una suma ponderada de i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ s que son el número diferente de sensores que los que se pueden implementar en un momento en que se despliegue N sensores en cada paso. Para N alrededor de 16, la probabilidad de que la exposición mínima esté por encima de ED varía mucho como se muestra en la Figura 5 y el peso asociado con el primer término de la suma (n) aumenta rápidamente, mientras que los pesos asociados con un mayor número de sensores disminuyen. Esta es la causa del mínimo local y el costo comienza a aumentar nuevamente cuando el aumento de N compensa la disminución de los pesos. La segunda asignación de costos es (CD = 5, CS = 1) para que el costo de una implementación sea igual al costo de cinco sensores (tenga en cuenta que solo el costo relativo de CD/CS determina la forma de los gráficos). En este caso, la implementación de un sensor a la vez está prohibido por el costo de la implementación y el número óptimo de sensores para implementar en cada paso es 19. Nuevamente, encontramos que la curva presenta un mínimo local para n = 9 que se debe a las variaciones en los pesos. La última asignación de costos es (CD = 100, CS = 1) y el costo mínimo se logra al implementar 27 sensores en cada paso. Estos resultados son específicos para la región y los parámetros que caracterizan la señal emitida por el objetivo que fueron elegidos para la simulación. Se pueden derivar resultados similares para otros parámetros, la mayor parte del esfuerzo que reside en encontrar las distribuciones de exposición a través de la simulación.7. Conclusión Este documento aborda el problema de la implementación del sensor en una región para ser monitoreado para la intrusión objetivo. Se propone y analiza un mecanismo para la colaboración del sensor para realizar la detección de objetivos para evaluar la exposición de las rutas a través de la región. La exposición mínima se utiliza como una medida de la bondad de la implementación, el objetivo es maximizar la exposición de la ruta menos expuesta en la región. En el caso de que los sensores se colocan aleatoriamente en una región para ser monitoreados, se desarrolla un mecanismo para la implementación secuencial en los pasos. La estrategia consiste en implementar un número limitado de sensores a la vez hasta que se logre la exposición mínima deseada. La función de costo utilizada en este estudio depende de la cantidad de sensores implementados en cada paso y el costo de cada implementación. A través de la simulación, se evaluó la distribución de la exposición mínima obtenida por despliegue aleatorio para un número variable de sensores implementados. Estos resultados se utilizaron para evaluar el costo de implementación para un número variable de sensores implementados en cada paso. Descubrimos que el número óptimo de sensores implementados en cada paso varía con el costo relativo asignado a la implementación y los sensores. Los resultados de este estudio pueden extenderse a regiones más grandes con diferentes parámetros objetivo. La solución propuesta en este documento también se puede mejorar considerando la implementación del número variable de sensores en cada paso y este problema de múltiples variables requiere una mayor investigación.8.

In particular, if the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), then n i=1 Ni has a Chi-square distribution of degree n. Due to the presence of noise, the sensors may incorrectly decide that a target is present even though there is no target in the field.",

        "Therefore, the detection probability associated with each point u reflects the measurements performed during time T. Considering the path, the net probability of not detecting a target traversing the field using P is the product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u ∈ P. That is, if G(P) denotes the net probability of not detecting a target as it traverses over path P, then, log G(P) = u∈P log(1 − D(u))du, where D(u) is either Dv(u) of Dd(u) depending on whether the sensors use value or decision fusion to arrive at a consensus decision.",

        "DEPLOYMENT In this section, the problem of sensor deployment for unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are identified. 3.1 Problem formulation Consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized traversal using a sensor network.",
        "The target to traverse the sensor field emits a given energy level K and the stochastic of the noise in the region is known.",
        "The sensors are to be deployed over the region in a random fashion where the sensors locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the number or density of sensors can be chosen.",
        "The problem is to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the region.",
        "This performance is measured by the false alarm probability and the path exposure defined in section 2.",
        "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",
        "It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.",
        "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
        "Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.",
        "However, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors.",
        "Indeed some sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability, in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same vicinity.",
        "A study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved.",
        "In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate. 3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used.",
        "Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.",
        "To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.",
        "The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level.",
        "If it does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available sensors are deployed.",
        "The number of sensors used in this strategy can be minimized by deploying one sensor at a time.",
        "However, a cost is usually associated with each deployment of sensors and deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the cost of single sensors.",
        "By assigning a cost to both single sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be deployed at first and thereafter can be determined.",
        "In the next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding the optimal solution.",

        "This is an approximation since the exposure obtained with n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with only k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.",
        "We observed that the re-deployment of just a few sensors can substantially modify the coverage of the region, for example when filling empty spaces.",
        "The approximation is also justified by the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions.",
        "Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many different deployment positions, some of which can be easily improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g. when there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors (e.g. when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region).",
        "As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum number of steps S so that nS = M. Note that ni − ni−1 is the number of sensors deployed at step i.",
        "Also let Cd be the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and Cs be the cost of each sensor.",

        "SIMULATION In this section, we present results of simulations that were conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of the number of sensors deployed. 5.1 Method The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a predefined region.",
        "The random deployment is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local approximation.",
        "For every deployment, the minimum exposure is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm presented in section 2.",
        "A decay factor of k = 2 and maximum energy of K = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted by targets (cf Equation 1).",
        "The region monitored is of size 20×20 with a noise (AWGN) of variance 1, so that the signal coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is 8 or more units length away from a sensor.",
        "The sensors use value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision on the presence of a target in the region.",
        "The threshold for detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors to give a constant false alarm probability.",

        "To illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10 and 15 sensors are shown in Figure 4.",
        "We observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm probability of .04.",
        "The highest density is obtained for values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero for higher values of exposure.",
        "For deployment of 10 sensors, we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density for values below .04, then increases and has about constant density for values lying between .1 and .98.",
        "We also observe a peak of density around 1.",
        "For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.",
        "The density slowly increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1.",
        "As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases.",
        "When randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a placement providing a desirable minimum exposure.",
        "When deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a desirable exposure level.",
        "When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed.",
        "We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of sensors.",
        "The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%.",
        "These values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in Equation 4.",
        "The graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed.",
        "The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 6.",
        "RESULTS In this section, we evaluate the expected cost of deploying sensors using the simulation results.",
        "The optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results.",
        "For this cost analysis, the region parameters and signal model are the same as specified in section 5.",
        "We further assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S. In this case, Equation 4 reduces to E{C} = (Cd + n.Cs) S−1 i=1 i. i−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (1 − Fi.n(ed)) + (S.Cd + M.Cs) S−1 j=1 Fj.n(ed) (5) We evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of ed = 95%.",
        "The three corresponding graphs are shown in Figure 6.",
        "The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95%.",
        "Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesnt affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph.",
        "Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.",
        "The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.",
        "For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.",
        "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
        "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",
        "In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19.",
        "Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.",
        "The last cost assignment is (Cd = 100, Cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved when deploying 27 sensors at every step.",
        "These results are specific to the region and the parameters characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were chosen for the simulation.",
        "Similar results can be derived for other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the exposure distributions through simulation. 7.",
        "CONCLUSION This paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment in a region to be monitored for target intrusion.",
        "A mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths through the region.",
        "The minimum exposure is used as a measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
        "In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in steps is developed.",
        "The strategy consists of deploying a limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved.",
        "The cost function used in this study depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and the cost of each deployment.",
        "Through simulation, the distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed.",
        "These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.",
        "We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in each step varies with the relative cost assigned to deployment and sensors.",

                "This performance is measured by the false alarm probability and the path exposure defined in section 2.",
                "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",
                "It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.",
                "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
                "Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.",
                "However, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors.",

                "A study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved.",
                "In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate. 3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used.",
                "Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.",

                "The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 6.",

                "Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.",

                "For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.",
                "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
                "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",
                "In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19.",

                "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",
                "It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.",
                "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
                "Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.",
                "However, since the deployment is random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure level is achieved for a given number of sensors.",

                "A study of the statistical distribution of exposure for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level is achieved.",
                "In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate. 3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used.",
                "Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.",
                "To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.",
                "The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to determine if it satisfies the desired performance level.",

                "The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 6.",

                "Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesnt affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph.",
                "Overall, the expected <br>number of sensor</br> to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.",
                "The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.",
                "For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.",
                "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
                "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",
                "In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19.",
                "Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.",

                "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",

                "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
                "Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.",

                "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
                "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",

                "This performance is measured by the false alarm probability and the path exposure defined in section 2.",
                "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",
                "It is assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.",
                "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",
                "Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases (if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are deployed in the region.",

                "In practical situations, only a limited number of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited detection level with associated confidence level is achievable at a given false alarm rate. 3.2 Solution Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors can be used.",
                "Deploying the M sensors results in the maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when considering the cost of sensors.",

                "For deployment of 15 sensors, densities start at zero for small values and remain very small for most values of minimum exposure.",
                "The density slowly increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1.",
                "As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average as the number of sensors deployed increases.",

                "The graph shows that the confidence level to obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the number of sensors deployed.",
                "The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors. 6.",

                "The optimal number of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can be derived from these results.",

                "Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesnt affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph.",
                "Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.",
                "The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.",
                "For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.",
                "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
                "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",
                "In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19.",
                "Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.",
                "The last cost assignment is (Cd = 100, Cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved when deploying 27 sensors at every step.",

                "The false alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms.",

                "Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the region.",

                "When deploying 15 sensors, it is very likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors deployed.",

                "The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to be used to achieve an exposure of 95%.",
                "Since Cd = 0, the number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesnt affect the cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on the graph.",
                "Overall, the expected number of sensor to be 47 deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.",
                "The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤ i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each step.",
                "For n around 16, the probability that the minimum exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of sensors decrease.",
                "This is the cause of the local minimum and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n compensates for the decrease in weights.",
                "The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors (note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the shape of the graphs).",
                "In this case, deploying one sensor at a time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19.",
                "Again, we find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that is due to the variations in weights.",

                "The strategy consists of deploying a limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum exposure is achieved.",
